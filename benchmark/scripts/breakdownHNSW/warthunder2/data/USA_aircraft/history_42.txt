History of A-36: 
The A-36 Apache, also referred to as Mustang, was a ground attack variant of the P-51 Mustang. In 1942, the Mustang I began to see service with the Royal Air Force and saw its first combat. It performed well, and North American Aviation wanted to get a contract to produce it for the USAAF, but there was no funding for fighter contracts in 1942. Instead, they decided to market it as an attack aircraft, as there were contracts available. They modified the Mustang to make it a dive-bomber, and designated it the A-36 Apache. Bomb racks and dive brakes were added, and the wings were strengthened.
