Description of PBY-5A_Catalina: 
In 1933, three companies, Consolidated, Martin, and Douglas were assigned to design a long-range flying boat that could patrol for hundreds of miles. Consolidated's design was one of two that were chosen by the U.S. Navy although they were both extremely underpowered. Consolidated's design would later receive the designation "PBY" which stood for "Patrol Bomber" and "Y" signifying the manufacturer. The PBY-5A would receive two Wright R-1830-92 engines each making 1,200 hp and an incredible range of over 2,500 miles (4,023 km). The PBY would serve effectively in maritime patrol, search-and-rescue, anti-submarine warfare, and more. One notable instance of the Catalina's was the "Black Cats" squadrons which utilized PBYs painted in black for night operations in the Pacific. PBYs are still flown today for missions like firefighting.
