Usage of SB2C-1C: 
In Air Realistic battles, the SB2C receives an air start, which means that it is usually able to intercept enemy fighters in their climb path. When this happens, the Helldiver is very effective in a head-on role, with 2 powerful 20 mm cannons. If stealth belts are loaded, the enemy may not even realise that they are being shot at, since they may not expect a bomber to have offensive capabilities. Another way to deal with enemy fighters is in a dogfighting role. The SB2C has a surprisingly good turn rate, especially at around 300 km/h, and can turn with such planes as the La-5 and Fw 190 series of fighters. Often, the enemy will be caught off guard by the Helldiver's dogfighting ability and enter into an engagement that they cannot win, allowing the pilot to secure the kill.
