Description of F9F-5: 
The F9F-5 was a significant improvement over the F9F-4. It had substantial airframe changes over the F9F-4 such as a longer fuselage. More importantly, it had the Pratt & Whitney J48 turbojet which produces over 3,000 kgf. Over 600 F9F-5s were delivered to Naval squadrons and would end up serving in the Korean War. The F9F-5 was also used by the Blue Angels flight team until they were replaced by the F9F-8 Cougar in 1954. In 1962, F9F-5s would end up being redesignated as either target drones or drone directors until their final retirement a few years later.
