History of PBM-3_%22Mariner%22: 
Service experience gained from the twenty-one PBM-1s in USN service found anticipated deficiencies and desires, so Martin went back to the drawing board for a major redesign. The most obvious change was replacing the retractable wing float with a robust fixed mount (possibly due to reliability issues with the retractable design) and eliminating the wing bomb bay for more fuel tanks and enlargement of the nacelle bomb bay. Also changed was the round bubble windows in waist mounts to square openings with doors similar to those of the B-24s. Also added were small vanes above and below the horizontal stabilizer attached to the vertical, a feature unique only to the Mariner. There was also numerous turrets variations, different makes or mounting two .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine gun options. To top off the multitude of external changes, more powerful 1,700 hp (1,270 kW) Wright R-2600-12 engines were installed to balance the increased weight. The PBM-3 was the largest and heaviest twin-engine seaplane in production at the time. It was not long before a large radome was added in a prominent structure above the cockpit, reducing performance but benefiting from finding enemy submarines and ships farther away; the result was sinking a number of Japanese and German submarines during their service.
