Description of P-38K: 
The P-38K was essentially a P-38G airframe fitting with the more powerful V-1710-75/77 engines. These engines could make well over 1600 hp. The P-38K also had better propellers which also helped with the performance. Test flights were conducted in early 1943 and the results were promising. The climb rate was greatly increased and was far better performing compared to America's main fighters at the time (P-47D and the P-51B). However, this idea never reached production due to the extensive time needed to get production ready for an engine change. This also sparked talks about a Merlin-powered P-38 but that was also rejected. Only one prototype was developed.
