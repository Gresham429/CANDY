History of F9F-2: 
The Panther was born during a time when the jet engine was beginning to make its appearance into service. The United States Navy commissioned a jet-powered fighter for its carrier decks. Grumman began work on the XF9F-1 Prototype (Grumman designation G75). The airframe would carry two crewmen and implement four turbojet engines. At the time, four of them were planned to be used due to the low power output by early turbojet engines. This ran into several issues including taking up too much space on American carriers. Eventually, the design was dropped in favour of the XF9F-2 prototype, Grumman's Model G79, that utilized 1 crew member and eventually a single-engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was used for basic testing. Pratt & Whitney were eventually able to produce the engine and it was designated "J42". As the Panther moved along the creation process, items like wingtip fuel tanks were added to increase its range. Carrier trials with the prototypes were completed in March of 1949. The F9F-2 entered US Navy service in May of 1949.
