History of SB2C-1C: 
The SB2C Helldiver was a carrier-based dive bomber made by the Curtiss company. The aircraft had been produced from 1943-1945. It was meant to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless as a much faster alternative to the SBD Dauntless though it sacrificed mobility. Many of the crews of the SB2C Helldiver nicked named this aircraft "Big-Tailed Beast", "Two-Cee", and Son of a Bitch Second Class due to the horrible turning capabilities of the aircraft. The aircraft mainly saw service in the United States Navy, United States Army Air Forces, French Air Force, and Royal Thai Air Force. It was a much larger version of the SBD Dauntless but many of the pilots that flew the SB2C were disappointed with the turning capability which led many pilots to go back to the outdated SBD Dauntless as it had better turning but less speed but many pilots preferred it rather than the SB2C. A total of 7,140 aircraft were produced in total from 1943-1945.
