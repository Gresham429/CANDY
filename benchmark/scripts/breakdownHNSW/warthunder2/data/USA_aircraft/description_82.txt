Description of XP-50: 
In 1939, the U.S. Army issued Circular Proposal 39-775 for new fighters that could utilize new engines. Of the four companies that submitted designs, Grumman submitted Design 41 which was largely based on Design 34 (XF5F-1) but would utilize two Wright R-1820 radial engines. Although Lockheed’s design was deemed more favorable, the Army wanted Grumman to continue revising Design 41 as a backup in case Lockheed’s proposal ran into hiccups. Grumman’s resubmission, Design 45, was later given the designation XP-50. The XP-50 was fitted with two Wright R-1820-67/69 radial engines which produced 1,200 hp with the help of turbosuperchargers. The XP-50 was promising in test flights until a turbosupercharger explosion led to the loss of the prototype. The XP-50 project was then canceled.
