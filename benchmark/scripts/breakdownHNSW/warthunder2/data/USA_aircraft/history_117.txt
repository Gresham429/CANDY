History of AU-1: 
The AU-1 stood out from the rest of the Corsair variants, as it was not designed as a fighter, but as a dedicated ground-attack aircraft. The F4U-6 was developed from the F4U-5 series, and as such had similar characteristics. It had the same metal skinned wing panels and blown cockpit design as the F4U-5 series. It was designed as a low altitude ground attack aircraft, and as such had a large number of modifications that other Corsairs did not receive.
