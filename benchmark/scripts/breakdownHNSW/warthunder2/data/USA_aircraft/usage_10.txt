Usage of OS2U-3: 
The Kingfisher is classified as a bomber and as such it spawns at altitude. Primarily, it should be used in the ground attack role across all game modes. If possible, stay out of sight of the enemy and try to take indirect routes to desired targets. The single 7.62 mm gun is capable of destroying artillery, AAA (stationary and on trucks), landing craft, and armoured cars, but this is ill advised if an enemy aircraft is nearby. Tanks and light pillboxes cannot be destroyed with such a small MG calibre and will require bombs. Cargo ships will require a single 100 lb hit on deck.
