History of B-57A: 
In 1951 the US Air Force was looking for a reliable assault aircraft after the failure of the 1949 Martin XB-51 project. The English Electric Canberra was already known for its operational versatility, flexibility, ease of handling, range and payload capacity. Martin accordingly contracted for the Canberra under licence. The first Canberra B.2 left Aldergrove, Northern Ireland on February 21, 1951, and crossed the Atlantic non-stop and without refuelling, becoming the first jet to do so in 4 hours and 37 minutes.
