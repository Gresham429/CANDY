History of P-47D-25: 
Developed by North Republic Aviation, the main role of the P-47 Thunderbolt was Bomber Escort, at high altitude the 'Jug' could contend with the latest from the Luftwaffe. The design was to also include much better protection for the pilot by having increased armour around the cockpit, however, this increased its weight substantially. It was the first American fighter to receive more than the standard 6 x .50 calibre M2 Browning Machine guns, a total of 8 all together, making it the most powerful Allied aircraft in terms of firepower at the time. Thanks to its rugged design, the Thunderbolt was able to take a considerable beating, more so than other allied aircraft, also with its sturdy airframe and reliable radial engine, the 'Jug' quickly took on the role of ground attack, able to arm itself with 2,500 lbs of bombs and rockets. All in all the Thunderbolt was one of the most successful allied aircraft during the war, even with the introduction of the faster and more nimble P-51 Mustang, later modifications of the Thunderbolt would go on to see action in the later part of the Pacific Campaign against the Imperial Japanese Navy.
