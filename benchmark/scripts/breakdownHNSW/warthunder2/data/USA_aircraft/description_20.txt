Description of Galer%27s_F3F-2: 
Bob Galer was a naval aviator in the USMC. While flying in his F3F-2 for a landing on the USS Saratoga, a mishap occurred and his F3F-2 was ditched into the ocean. Galer would later become a double ace during the battle of Guadalcanal and would survive the war. He also served in Korea until he retired in the late 1950s. Galer was shot down four times and managed to survive every time. Galerâ€™s F3F-2, still resting at the bottom of the Pacific, was discovered by an American submersible in 1988 and recovered three years later. His plane is currently on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum.
