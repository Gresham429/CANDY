Description of F-16C: 
The F-16C Block 50 Fighting Falcon was a major improvement over the previous variants of the F-16. The previous Block 42 aircraft weighed 3,000+ lb (1,360 kg) over the early F-16s. To offset the increased weight, General Electric developed the F110-GE-129 which greatly increased thrust at both low and high altitudes. The Block 50 also received the Westinghouse APG-68(v)5 radar (upgraded to the -68(v)7 in later production models) which was much faster and generally more reliable. One of the biggest additions to the Block 50 was the ability to fire new ground attack munitions. The USAF received the first F-16 Block 50 in late 1991 and many more were sent to foreign countries as well.
