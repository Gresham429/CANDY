Usage of P-51C-10: 
The P-51C-10 has outstanding performance compared to other planes that can meet in the same bracket (Enduring Confrontation 3, BR 3.7-4.7). Level speed is higher at all altitudes than the vast majority of things that it can face, so it can easily escape from anything when it finds itself in trouble. The climb rate is also very good and allows it to get to 3,000-5,000 m quickly. This plane, like all other Mustangs, does not overheat when the radiator is set to 90-100%, it also does not slow down the plane, so it can always cruise with enabled WEP, which is not limited, always engage other planes with tremendous speed advantage and make use of very good mid and high-speed manoeuvrability. The sustained climb rate is worse than that of the Bf 109 F-4 or G-2 by 2-4 m/s. Escaping from them by climbing away should be avoided, but it still allows the plane to get pretty quick to 3,000 to 5,000 m; also, the zoom climb is very good.
