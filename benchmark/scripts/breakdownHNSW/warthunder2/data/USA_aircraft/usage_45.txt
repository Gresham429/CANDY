Usage of SB2C-4: 
The SB2C-4 is very much like it's older sibling model in-game, which is a dive bomber/attacker capable of wreaking havoc to both soft and hard ground targets and enemy bases. Despite its capability to carry rockets and under-wing bombs and be used as an attacker, do not attempt to do so, unless you are sure a nearby enemy fighter does not immediately single you out as a target. This aircraft has fairly good manoeuvrability but does not fly nearly as well as any of the fighters you may encounter. However, this does not mean you cannot defend yourself in dire times. A distinct advantage of this aircraft is its firepower is more than enough to bring down any attacking enemy pilot with some skill, however, it's instability in coming out of rough turns can cause problems on getting guns on target difficult. Most pilots don't expect you to carry so much firepower with the extra machine guns so taking head-ons with some planes can work in your favour because most pilots do not expect you to have that much firepower. Moreover, due to it's firepower and airspawn, being a bomber hunter is no problem either. It is important to remember to use this plane's main niche to your advantage as you will be vulnerable to enemy gunners. This plane's niche as fast bomber is further reinforced compared to the SB2C-1c as it carries double the bomb load (2,000 lb/ 907 kg) and if you survive long enough with your firepower to defend yourself you can be a considerable drain to the enemy's ticket counter. Overall, this aircraft is a solid performer in Arcade battles which is a delightful blend of defensive/offensive firepower, speed (not fighter-like though), manoeuvrability and bombing capability specifically for a dive bomber. A recommended aircraft to take out in tier 3 battles and as a silver lions factory!
