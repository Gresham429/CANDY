Usage of AD-2: 
When used in all battle modes, be sure to steer clear of enemy fighters, pick the ground targets that are farthest away from the usual dogfight zones, for example, the far left base on Alternate History Krysmk has plenty of targets and is seldom visited by Soviet aircraft. One of the first weapon modifications you can unlock are torpedoes, a weapon which while seldom used, can turn a very quick profit when aiming for a light cruiser, destroyer or a Japanese aircraft carrier (as British and American ones are far more difficult to sink). With that, you can quickly grind down the payload line until you can carry your maximum ordnance. Once fully upgraded, choose your payload based on your skills in bombing and rockets. If you find you're better at rockets, load Tiny Tims and aim for heavy targets once your HVARs are used. Otherwise load up the 3,000 lbs of bombs and obliterate any position you feel.
