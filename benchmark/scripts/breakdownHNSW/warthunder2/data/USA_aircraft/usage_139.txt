Usage of F-104C: 
The F-104 is an interceptor which relies solely on its extremely high speed and acceleration. This great speed comes with a great cost; the F-104 undoubtedly has the worst overall turn rate at high tiers (and perhaps in the whole game as well). Keep that in mind when playing it. It is highly recommended not to dogfight in the F-104 as you aren't out-turning anything, and even if you have someone energy trapped, it is hard to capitalize on it as the F-104's manoeuvrability is just so poor. Additionally, if someone gets on your tail, there isn't much you can do. While the F-104 does have a good roll rate, the turning capability makes it so it cannot effectively perform defensive manoeuvres. Even if you manage to get a tailing enemy to overshoot, the F-104 can't turn well enough to use the opportunity to attack.
