Usage of B-24D-25-CO: 
The Liberator will face many high-altitude dedicated bomber interceptors with 20â€“30 mm cannons, making for an extremely dangerous environment. The defensive guns should be treated as a last resort; combat with fighters should be avoided at all costs by the use of careful route planning and cloud cover, if available.
