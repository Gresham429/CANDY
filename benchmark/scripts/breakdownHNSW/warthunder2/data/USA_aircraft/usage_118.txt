Usage of F2G-1: 
Generally, this aircraft is best suited to the in-game American doctrine of boom-and-zooming. In composition with stellar dive speed, engine performance, and long-range weaponry: you have great capability to dance around other propeller planes with relative impunity. Due to this, this is an amazing plane for dogfights, which you should always engage in. You should be cruising at ~3km, a perfect altitude to dive on any ground huggers or to dive away from any climbers who might swoop down upon you. Any dogfight you wish to initiate should be prioritized energy-wise; you should master the use of your flaps, they will give that needed edge. Keep fights low. In the circumstance you are below another propeller plane, you should extend the other direction and increase your IAS. Climbers like Bf 109 K-4, Ta-152 H, G.56, and so on, will not peruse you.  Alternatively, you may try baiting them into a dogfight.
