Description of SBD-3: 
The SBD Dauntless was the workhorse of the US Navy, serving from 1940 all the way to late 1944 as the main carrier-based dive bomber. It replaced the SBC Helldiver and SBU Corsair aboard US carriers. Featuring a range of about 1,700 km, and quite heavy armaments for its size and role - two 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns in the engine cowling and a bomb load of up to 2,250 lbs, it was very versatile plane. The SBD participated in many battles in the Pacific theatre, and achieved successes such as the sinking of Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō during the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942. Its biggest success was during the Battle of Midway in June 1942, when SBD bombers sank four aircraft carriers, namely Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, and Hiryū. By 1944, the SBD was slowly being replaced by the faster and more modern SB2C Helldiver. Foreign users included the Royal Navy, Free French Air Force, Mexico, Chile, and Morocco.
