Usage of F-84F: 
The F-84F is capable of high speeds for its Battle Rating, but takes a very long time to get there due to slow acceleration. Thus, the pilot generally must first climb in order to reach speeds similar to those of its opponents. Due to diverse ordnance options, it is useful as a Close Air Support jet in mixed battles, or to destroy ground/naval targets and bases in Air Battles. It can be used as a boom-and-zoom fighter, perhaps after first dropping ordnance, as its powerful engine provides good energy retention. Air spawn in Realistic Air battles provides the somewhat necessary advantage for this. Its guns will be familiar from other F-84 and F-86 models, and are reasonably effective if aimed properly. However, the F-84F is not a turnfighter by any means and is a cumbersome aircraft, especially at slow speeds.
