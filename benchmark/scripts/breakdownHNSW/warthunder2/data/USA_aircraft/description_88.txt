Description of F-82E: 
To combat the issue of single-pilot fighters flying long combat missions, the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) proposed a two-seat, double-engine version of the Mustang. The idea was proposed in 1943 and one year later the USAAF ordered two XP-82s. The XP-82 was essentially two P-51H fuselages fused together. The first two prototypes had the standard Packard Merlin engine which produced 1,860 hp. However, concerns grew with Packard's ability to produce more Merlin engines and the Allison engine had developed into a decent powerplant. This was compounded by the fact that Rolls-Royce was significantly increasing the price of the Merlin engine. By this time, the Allison engines could perform sufficiently at high altitudes and could produce almost 2,000 horsepower at sea level thanks to the water-methanol injection system. Around 96 F-82Es were delivered with the Allison V-1710-143/145 engines.
