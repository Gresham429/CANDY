History of F4F-4: 
The F4F-4 Wildcat was an improved version of the F4F-3. The main improvements were the addition of a third pair of wing-mounted .50 cal machine guns - for a total of six machine guns, and the Grumman Sto-Wing system, which allowed the outer wings to fold inwards on hinges. This would theoretically allow 5 Wildcats to be stored in the space that 2 would have taken up before, but this didn't quite work out in actuality.
