History of AD-2: 
The piston-engine Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a carrier-based, single-seat, long-range, high-performance dive/torpedo bomber. It was equipped with the 2,700 HP Wright 3350 Duplex-Cyclone Engine, the same engine that equipped to the B-29 Superfortress Bomber. It was designed to replace the Helldiver and the Avenger torpedo bombers as the Navy's primary attack craft. Unfortunately, it didn't serve in WWII due to the program being delayed. It went on to serve with distinction in later wars such as Korea and Vietnam.
