Description of F-104A: 
The first production version of the Starfighter series was the F-104A. 140+ F-104A Starfighters were ordered by the USAF and in total 170 Starfighters were in service (some YF-104As were converted to production standard). The F-104A had a stronger airframe as well as additions made to the airframe for stability. The F-104A was planned to replace the ageing F-100 Super Sabre but later didn't fit the requirements set by the USAF. It was stuck in limbo until problems with the production of the Convair-built F-106 let the Starfighter live on in another role, interdiction. At this time, the F-104A was powered by the J79-GE-3A which was riddled with issues. The F-104As were grounded shortly after to resolve the issues with the -3A until the J79-GE-3B came to fruition. Even after the engine change, the USAF still found the F-104A to be lacklustre for air interception due to the lack of all-weather capability and low endurance. Many surplus Starfighters were sent to other countries.
