Usage of F9F-2: 
The F9F-2 is best described as a support fighter. It is often outclassed by more powerful enemies such as the MiG-15, but as a support to allies, it shines nonetheless. In this play-style, the Panther can leverage its desirable dive characteristics to prey on distracted opponents. A Panther pilot may often find themselves with an enemy on their six. In such a defensive situation, the F9F-2 provides an excellent roll rate with which to dodge enemy fire. However, to dispatch the opponent, it is often necessary to employ the help of teammates.
