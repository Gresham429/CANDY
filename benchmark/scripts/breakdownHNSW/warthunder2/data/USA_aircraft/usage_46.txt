Usage of B-34: 
In the hands of an experienced player, the B-34 can be one of, if not the deadliest aircraft of its tier. While being in the bomber line of the tech tree, the B-34 is better suited for use as a frontline bomber, bomber interceptor, and even a heavy fighter in some situations. If played in a bombing role, try to get in low and entice enemy fighters into chasing you while you go for your bombing targets; your powerful 12.7 mm turret will make quick work of most enemies you'll encounter at its tier. If played as a bomber interceptor, aiming for crucial parts of the target's aircraft (Engine, wings, cockpit, Etc.) with your robust offensive armament will take down enemy bombers quickly and efficiently. Using the B-34 in a heavy fighter role will require the use of your flaps, so make sure to use them when appropriate; as the B-34 has poor energy retention. Head-ons with enemy fighters are ill-advised, as your pilot is quite susceptible to frontal enemy fire as well as your engines that will take damage quite easily.
