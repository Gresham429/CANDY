Usage of PBJ-1H: 
The best way to destroy tanks with the 75 mm cannon is to use first-person pilot view which reduces parallax because you are closer to the level of the cannon, allowing for the crosshairs to be more accurate. The shells will almost always penetrate an enemy vehicle, so shoot at the points where the crew is in mixed battles.
