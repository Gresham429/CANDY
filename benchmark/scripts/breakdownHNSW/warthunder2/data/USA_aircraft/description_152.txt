Description of F11F-1: 
In the early '50s, Grumman began the G-98 project as a privately funded effort to redesign the existing F9F Cougar into a more sleek, high-speed fighter. However, a Cougar redesign was deemed unfeasible and a completely new design was thought of. The G-98 project had a completely different shape compared to the Cougar, utilizing the area rule to reduce drag at transonic speeds. It would also be powered by the Wright J65-18 afterburning turbojet. In 1953, the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics approved an order for two G-98 prototypes. Although a redesign was first thought of, the G-98 project was still called the F9F-9 Cougar until the Navy finally stated it was more than just a Cougar. It was given the designation F11F-1 "Tiger" to keep the Grumman feline naming scheme. The F11F-1 was soon phased out of service after the Vought F-8 Crusader was deemed more reliable and modern for the time, only lasting 4 years in frontline service. Previous orders were canceled, but the F11F-1 did find a home with the Blue Angels flight demo squadron for over a decade.
