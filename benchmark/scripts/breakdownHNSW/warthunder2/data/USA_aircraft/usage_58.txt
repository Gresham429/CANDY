Usage of P-63A-5: 
This aircraft is a good all-altitude fighter and can be used as an interceptor. The A-5 can out-climb most of its opponents un-upgraded, although "side climbing" is recommended. Its straight-line speed, especially at higher altitudes, is respectable, competing with Bf 109s of the rank. This aircraft has a poor turn-time at slower speeds, but as with most US aircraft, its high-speed performance is significantly better than the aircraft it faces, making it a good Boom & Zoom aircraft. The 37 mm gun improves damage to aircraft since the 4 x 12.7 mm Brownings are not greatly powerful at the higher tiers- the 37 mm gun compliments the 12.7 mm as a good bomber hunter, combined with the sleek profile of the aircraft. The aircraft should not be used, as a ground attack vehicle, since it can only carry one 500 lb bomb and the amount of ammunition for the 12.7 mm guns is not great. The 37 mm gun can be used in a ground attack, although some don't prefer this tactic as it reduces the ammo count as a whole for the aircraft, which is one of its limiting factors in combat. Tactically, the aircraft is good for small dives against turn-fighting opponents on the tail of your allies, from around 1,000 m or less above the target. Keeping any "side-climbers" down is normally good since the speed and rate of climb allow the P-63 to catch these planes and send them back down.
