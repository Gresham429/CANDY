Description of F-86A-5: 
The F-86A-5, formerly known as the P-86 before June 1948, was one of the most successful early jet aircraft. It featured swept wings which greatly reduced drag and increased the top speed to over 1,000 km/h (625 mph). In addition, the F-86A featured a ranging radar that could calculate the lead required for firing upon an enemy fighter; a big improvement over the Mark 18 optical computing sight that required manual adjustments before firing.. Unfortunately, effectiveness was still hampered by the now weak .50 cal machine guns against jet aircraft which were typically almost all metal airframes. Nonetheless, the F-86 proved to be a very capable aircraft in the Korean War even if it was largely outdated by the late 1950s.
