Usage of A-4B: 
The A-4B while designated by the U.S. Navy as an attacker can work as a multi-role aircraft. Though the variety of armament leans heavily to the attacker side, this aircraft also has a fighter side which can feel more like a hotrod compared to some of the other fighters out there such as the F-4 coming in at 14-tonnes more massive.
