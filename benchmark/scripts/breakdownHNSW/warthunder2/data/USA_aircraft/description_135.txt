Description of F-89D: 
The F-89D Scorpion was designed and built to be an all-weather interceptor intended to neutralize any potential invading Soviet bomber force. The USAAF was intent of replacing the P-61 Black Widow with another night fighter, one specifically which would fly faster (minimum 850 km/h / 530 mph) almost assuredly requiring the usage of jets. To round out the aircraft for ground attack if needed, it would also need to accommodate 1,000 lb bombs and eight larger rocket types externally. Initial wind tunnel testing of the fighter determined that the proposed swept-wings were insufficient at slow speeds and were changed out with straight wings. Though causing a loss of high-end performance, increased stability at low speeds was necessary. The F-89D was a variant using 104 Folding-Fin Mighty Mouse Aerial Rockets and underwing HVAR rockets. The rockets worked with a proximity fuse, and allowed the fighter to launch a salvo to a bomber and then reacquire another bomber, however the rockets were very inaccurate, which meant that large salvos were needed for one or two rockets to explode near the target.
