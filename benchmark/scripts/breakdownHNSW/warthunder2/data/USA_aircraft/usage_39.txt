Usage of F4U-1A: 
When flying an F4U, use Boom-n-Zoom tactics to excel with the aircraft's performance. This means that the F4U-1A should climb immediately and then dive on lower flying aircraft, then use its speed and momentum from the dive to climb. The Corsair does turn well but loses energy and speed rapidly, so avoid turn fights or flat manoeuvres. However, this aircraft only has eight minutes of WEP time, so pilots should limit its use to only when needing an extra boost of power while in a fight or while running away.
