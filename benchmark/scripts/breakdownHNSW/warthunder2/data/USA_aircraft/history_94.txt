History of F7F-1: 
By around 1938, the U.S. Navy started investigating into the possibilities of a twin-engine carrier-borne fighter. The contract to develop such a fighter was awarded to Grumman. Quickly thereafter the XF5F was designed. The compact aircraft was to include a 23 mm Madsen cannon, two .50 calibre machine guns, and two .30 calibre machine guns. The Skyrocket test results were not very satisfactory and in 1941 the U.S. Navy moved onto to a new aircraft. The new goal was to create a heavy fighter for its upcoming Midway-class aircraft carriers. This next design was to incorporate two R-2800 engines, four 20 mm cannons, four .50 calibre machine guns, and the ability to carry bombs, rockets, and torpedoes.
