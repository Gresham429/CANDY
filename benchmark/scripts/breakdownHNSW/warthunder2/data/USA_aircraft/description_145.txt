Description of FJ-4B: 
In the early 1950s, the US Navy realized during the Korean War that their straight-wing fighters were inferior to the swept-wing MiG-15s. Since the F7U and F9F fighters were still under development, the Navy looked elsewhere for a suitable swept-wing stop-gap fighter, eventually settling on the Air Force's F-86 Sabre. Modifications were carried to make it compatible with aircraft carriers, including a stronger nose-wheel strut, all-moving flying tail without dihedral, outer wing panels folded upward and the windscreen was modified to aid the pilot's visibility. This version of the aircraft was designated as the FJ-2 Fury. The FJ-3 subsequently included a more powerful engine and improved and strengthened wings allowing both greater manoeuvrability and heavier ordnance payloads. The FJ-4 was a more aggressive approach, with a much thinner wing and skin which was milled from solid alloy plates allowing for more strength, durability, and aerodynamics. As the FJ-4 was built to be an all-weather interceptor, it required a considerable amount of fuel for operations and contained 50% more fuel than the FJ-3. Also, due to the stronger wing of this fighter, a total of six underwing stations were available allowing for more carrying capacity.
