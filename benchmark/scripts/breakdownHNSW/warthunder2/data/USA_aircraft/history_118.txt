History of F2G-1: 
Pratt & Whitney fitted an F4U-1 Corsair (Bu.No. 02460) - donated to them by the Navy - with their R-4360-4 Wasp Major engine in March 1943. The P&W R-4360-4 Wasp Major engine put out approximately 50% more power than the original P&W R-2800-1 Double Wasp used in other Corsairs; the 28-cylinder R-4360-4 was able to produce 3,000 horsepower. The F4U-1 fitted with the R-4360-4 was designated as F4U-1WM, and it was proven as a success after testing. As such, development of a production Corsair fitted with the R-4360 was given to Goodyear on 22 March 1944, when the Navy ordered 418 F2G-1 Corsairs and 10 F2G-2 Corsairs (a navalized variant with carrier capability).
