Description of B-17E: 
The B-17 Flying Fortress is one of the most iconic USAF bombers of WWII. The B-17E was the first version of the Flying Fortress produced in large numbers, with 512 delivered. Unlike previous versions, the B-17E had larger and extended fuselage by 3m, as well as a vertical tailfin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer added. A new tail gunner position was made in the new fuselage, dorsal and remotely operated ventral turret made by Sperry were also added. All these modifications also increased the aircraft's weight by about 20%, so a more powerful version of Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 engines were used.
