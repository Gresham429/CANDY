Description of F-5C: 
During the Vietnam War, the USAF requested F-5 Freedom Fighters due to the high loss rates of other aircraft in use. The Defense Department originally rejected the proposal but later accepted it in 1965. Codenamed "Skoshi Tiger", the USAF would use 12 F-5A's from the Military Assistance Program (MAP) for performance evaluations. They would eventually receive inflight refueling probes, lead-computing gunsight, significant armour on the belly, and designated as the F-5C Skoshi Tiger.  The Skoshi Tiger program would later end with the DoD rejecting a second proposal for more F-5's.
