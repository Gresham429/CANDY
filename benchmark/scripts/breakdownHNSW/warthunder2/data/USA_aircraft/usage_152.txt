Usage of F11F-1: 
This plane is an extremely potent support fighter. It is one of the fastest aircraft at its battle rating, which will be your greatest advantage over other fighters. If you are in a full down-tier, no one will be able to catch you if you play it right. In low altitude level flight, the F11 can sustain speeds near (but not quite) Mach 1. Mach 1 cannot be achieved in low altitude level flight (unless at low fuel), but putting the plane in even a small dive at low altitude allows you to go supersonic. Actually passing Mach 1 doesn't give you much of an advantage as you are already faster than many planes you will face. In up-tiers where faster supersonics such as the MiG-19 and early MiG-21 variants can be found, the F11's speed isn't as potent, but if you keep your speed up you will find yourself able to keep up with these faster and more manoeuvrable aircraft. It's worth noting that the F11 compresses substantially near Mach, so if an early air-to-air missile is launched at you at this time, you will need to decide whether to manoeuvre to avoid it, or pitch up to drain it of its likely low energy.
