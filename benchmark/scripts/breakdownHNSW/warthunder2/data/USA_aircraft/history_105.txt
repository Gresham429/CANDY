History of XA-38: 
In December of 1942, the USAAF gave Beech Aircraft Corporation a contract to construct 2 prototypes of their Model 28 Destroyer. The Model 28 started off as a bomber design, but was changed to a ground attack aircraft, in order to replace the A-20 Havoc in service. The design included a 75 mm cannon in order to ensure the plane could destroy armoured bunkers and tanks. 20 rounds were carried for the 75 mm cannon. There were also two .50 in Browning machine guns in the nose. There was a ventral and dorsal turret for self defense, with two .50 in Browning machine guns in each. The aircraft carried a crew of two, the pilot and the gunner. The gunner controlled both defensive turrets by remote control, using periscopes to aim. The Model 28, redesignated as the XA-38 Grizzly, started testing in 1944. It was proven to be reliable, and flew well in all regards for an attack aircraft. In addition, the armament was especially powerful and potent. However, the aircraft was never ordered, and never entered service.
