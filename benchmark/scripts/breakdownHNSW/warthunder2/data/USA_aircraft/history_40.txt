History of F4U-1A_(USMC): 
The single-engine Chance Vought F4U Corsair was designed in 1938 for a U.S. Navy single-seater carrier-based fighter competition. This aircraft was designed from the outset as a carrier borne fighter. It featured an inverted gull wing to keep the huge propeller off the ground while keeping the landing gear short for carrier operations. Even after the completion and launch of the F4U-1, a number of problems were discovered which initially prevented the aircraft from being used as a carrier-based fighter such as bad stall characteristics due to the gull wing, no visibility over the nose for carrier landings and bouncing off the deck after landing. The Navy was forced to use the first F4U-1s for Marine Corps ground-based operations until January 1945 when most of these problems were overcome.
