History of B-24D-25-CO: 
The B-24 was produced in several variants to fulfil operational and training needs. More Liberators were eventually built than any other US Warplane during World War II. The first B-24 prototype flew in December of 1939 named "XB-24". The aircraft was designed around the "Davis" wing, a long, thin, large area structure mounted high on the fuselage. The long wingspan gave the B-24 excellent high altitude performance and allowed it to extend its range. The twin bomb-bays were called "roller shutter" doors. The doors rolled up into the aircraft. The purpose of this design was to reduce the drag while the bomb bay doors are open. The bomb-load was stored vertically with a catwalk down the middle, this gave crews easy access to the rear of the fuselage. The Liberator was powered by four 1,200 HP Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engines. The aircraft also included a twin tail design and tricycle landing gear.
