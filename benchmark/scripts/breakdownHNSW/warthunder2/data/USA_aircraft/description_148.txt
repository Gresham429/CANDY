Description of AV-8A: 
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) sought a replacement of their aging A-4 Skyhawk fleet in the 1960s. The Hawker Siddley Harrier was evaluated and found suitable for their needs for a close air support aircraft in amphibious warfare. Following the acceptance of the Harrier, McDonnell Douglas obtained the production license to build the aircraft domestically within the United States with desired changes to fit the USMC needs. The USMC would receive their first Harriers in March 1971, designated AV-8A, and known within Hawker Siddley as Harrier Mk 50. The AV-8A would serve in the USMC, alongside its upgraded version the AV-8C, until its retirement in 1987.
