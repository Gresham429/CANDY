Description of F6F-5: 
The Grumman F6F Hellcat was used extensively in the Pacific Theater of WWII. The Hellcat was the ultimate answer against extremely manoeuvrable Japanese Zeroes. This plane greatly outperformed the Zero when taking advantage of high speeds and altitudes while having much better survivability thanks to the robust fuselage and the armour around the pilot. The F6F-5 was one of the latest versions of the Grumman F6F Hellcat. It was an improved version, with a redesigned engine cowling, a new windscreen structure with an integral bulletproof windscreen, new ailerons and strengthened tail surfaces; powered by a 2,200 hp (1,641 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-10W (-W denotes Water Injection) radial piston engine.
