Usage of F4U-1A_(USMC): 
Due to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair is very good at Boom and Zooming. It is recommended to be used this way, especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German planes BnZ is still recommended, but some planes you can out turn (Fw 190 A-4). As with every American fighter, always climb at the start of a match. The only way to be successful with this plane is to climb high and end up higher than the enemy. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of getting the enemy and forcing the enemy down low where you can finish them off.
