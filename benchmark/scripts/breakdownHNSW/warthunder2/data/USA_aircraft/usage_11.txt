Usage of SB2U-2: 
The SB2U-2 is a slow aircraft which leads it to have two options. The first that a pilot may choose is to hug the terrain. While flying to your target of choice (AAA sites, AA Vehicles or bases), fly along the terrain, utilizing the hills and valleys there are to fly through. Time on target may be limited before the enemy gets to your location, so drop your bombs and return to friendly cover as soon as possible. This aircraft can manoeuvre fairly well. Utilizing elevator and rudder controls, you can quickly flip this aircraft around and return to ground attacking targets you just flew over.
