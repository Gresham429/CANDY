Description of F-80C-10: 
The last production version of the P-80 Shooting Star was the P-80C. It was intended to have better engines and the first batches of P-80Cs had the Allison J33-A-23 engine. The last production batches had the more powerful Allison J33-A-35 engine that provided a 15% increase in thrust. Around 550 P-80Cs were fitted with the new engine. The P-80C also received the M3 Browning machine guns which boasted a very high fire rate. In 1948, the P-80C was redesignated as the F-80C. The vast majority of Shooting Stars that saw combat in the Korean War were F-80Cs and many were fitted with extra fuel tanks to increase endurance.  The F-80C was in service until 1958 when the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve retired them.
