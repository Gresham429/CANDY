Description of A-7K: 
The A-7K Corsair II is a subsonic (originally naval) strike aircraft, produced by Vought Aeronautics Division of LTV Aerospace Corporation. The A-7K was a dual seat variant of the A-7D built for the USAF; the A-7K specifically for the Air National Guard by lengthening the nose of the aircraft. The A-7K was mostly used for training, with 30 built to supplement the A-7Ds already in service. In the 1980s, several aircraft were equipped with a thermal sight, and this is the variant represented in-game.
