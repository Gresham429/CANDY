History of AV-8A: 
The US military had been paying close attention to the development of British VTOL aircraft through the 1950s / 60s, taking part in the testing and evaluation of the Hawker Siddeley P.1127 / Kestrel FGA.1 (prototypes that would eventually develop into the Harrier) in the mid-1960s. At the 1968 Farnborough air show two United States Marine Corps (USMC) pilots, Col. Thomas H. Miller (eventually promoted to Lieutenant General) and Lt. Col. Bud Baker unexpectedly arrived at the Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) chalet and announced they had been sent to test fly the new Harrier GR.1 aircraft. Within 2 weeks of the show both pilots had flown the Harrier and shortly after returned to the US with a very positive report of the aircraft.[1]
