Description of OS2U-1: 
The OS2U Kingfisher was built by Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division as a catapult launched observation floatplane designed to be used by different cruisers and battleships employed by the US at the time. It was a revolutionary design, using spot welding construction, creating a smooth fuselage with less drag. The first prototype flew in 1938 and production started in early 1940. While the performance was modest, it soon replaced the Curtiss SOC Seagull thanks to the more capable airframe. The OS2U-1 was very similar to the XOS2U-1 that flew in 1938, it used a Pratt & Whitney R-985-48 radial engine. The aircraft had a limited range, at least when compared to the OS2U-3, this was fixed in said version with additional self sealing fuel tanks in the wings.
