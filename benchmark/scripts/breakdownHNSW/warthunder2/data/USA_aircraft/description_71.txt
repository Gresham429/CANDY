Description of F6F-5N: 
The F6F-5N was built to be a night fighter from the regular F6F-5. A Westinghouse AN/APS-6 radar was fitted to the right wing that served well in very low visibility conditions. The main differences between the 5 and 5N were the ability of the 5N to carry two 20 mm cannons and four 12.7 mm machine guns and the addition of the radar. Other than that, the F6F-5N was virtually identical to the F6F-5. The F6F-5N also had the same 2,000 hp Wright R-2800-10W engine found in the F6F-5. Because it was basically the same aircraft, the F6Fâ€“5N did have worse performance due to the added drag and weight of the radar and cannons. Nonetheless, the ability to comfortably carry out night patrols and missions was worth the performance hit.
