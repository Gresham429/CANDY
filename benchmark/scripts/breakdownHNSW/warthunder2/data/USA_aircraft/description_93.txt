Description of F8F-1B: 
The F8F Bearcat was designed after the Battle of Midway. It was realized that an aircraft's rate of climb was extremely important, so it was decided to use the same Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial used on the earlier F6F Hellcat, but in a lighter airframe, capable of greater speed and climb rate. This came at the cost of range and armour for the pilot; the aircraft also featured a bubble canopy for all-around visibility. However, the fighter was developed too late for WWII. After the war, the introduction of naval jet aircraft like the F2H Banshee forced its early retirement; however, some of these fighters were used by France in Indochina against Viet Minh troops.
