Usage of P-63C-5: 
This aircraft is an improved version of the previous Kingcobra carrying the same armament and main gun. The aircraft is still a high-altitude interceptor/ energy fighter, with its turn radius slightly better than before. The quick dive speed and high energy retention allow the player, with the correct altitude, to engage opponents below numerous times using the high yo-yo method. This aircraft should not be used for ground attack due to its average ammo count.
