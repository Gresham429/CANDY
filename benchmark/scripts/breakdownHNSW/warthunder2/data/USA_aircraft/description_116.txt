Description of F4U-4B_VMF-214: 
The F4U-4B VMF-214 is based on the Marine Fighter Squadron 214 (VMF-214). Commonly referred to as the "Blacksheep" squadron, their squadron served two combat tours during the Korean War. VMF-214 had eight Corsairs which were transferred from USS Badoeng Strait to USS Sicily. The specific Corsair in-game is based on WE-18, which partook in a raid near Inchon. WE-18, piloted by Lt. Joe Bibby, was forced to crash land after receiving damage from enemy ground forces. Grenades were thrown at the plane to ensure its destruction and marked the final mission for WE-18.
