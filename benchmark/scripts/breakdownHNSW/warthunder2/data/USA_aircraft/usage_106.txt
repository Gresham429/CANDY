Usage of Bostwick%27s_P-47M-1-RE: 
First of all, the P-47 should always fly fast. No matter the altitude, it is recommended to fly at speeds higher than 520 km/h (~320 mph). One of the few things the P-47 is terrible at doing is prolonged dogfighting. Imagine a truck loaded with cement with wings strapped to the side. Congratulations, you just pictured a P-47 flying at low speeds. Now, with this out of the way you must remember one thing and one thing only, when and where possible, fly high, the higher the better. The higher in altitude the P-47 goes the better the engine performs compared to its potential adversaries. The best altitude for the P-47M is around 9,000 m (~30,000 ft), but it still can perform very good at lower altitudes ranging from 6,000 m (~20,000 ft) to 8,000 m (~26,000 ft). One drawback of the P-47M's engine is that it can easily overheat when using WEP for extended periods of time. However just disabling WEP for few seconds should be enough to cool down the powerful Pratt & Whitney powerplant hidden under the hood. More experienced pilots can utilize Manual Engine Controls (MEC) to eliminate overheating entirely.
