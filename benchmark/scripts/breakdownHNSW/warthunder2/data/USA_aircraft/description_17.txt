Description of PBY-5_Catalina: 
The PBY-5 Catalina was one of the most widely produced and used seaplanes in WWII, with a lifetime so extended, that some can be found today being used for civilian applications. Before the start of WWII, many critics said that the era of the seaplane had ended, because of their low speed. However the Catalina managed to grab the attention of the United States thanks to its amazing range, durability, and very large payload, meaning that it could be equipped to do several missions in a single run. The Catalina was largely used in the Atlantic and in the Pacific region, it was also exported to several Allied nations, including the Soviet Union, in which it gained an excellent reputation. It was mostly used for reconnaissance, however it was also used to hunt German U-Boats in the Atlantic, many times flying alongside convoy groups.
