Usage of F-4C_Phantom_II: 
The F-4C Phantom II is, frankly, not a dogfighter. That is because its ungainly manoeuvrability, large size, and lack of countermeasures leave it heavily disadvantaged and an easy target should one catch it in weapons range. The F-4C's best friend is its good speed and powerful armaments. As a result, F-4C pilots are forced to act as vultures, staying fast and using missiles or gunpods to pick off hapless targets of opportunity.
