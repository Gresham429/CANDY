History of F-86F-25: 
In order to improve the overall flight performance and air-to-ground ability of the current F-86F Sabre fighter, the North American Aviation company decided to start a new fighter program on October 26th, 1951, code name NA-191. The first improvement was adding a pair of additional pylons under the wings, so that the new Sabre fighter could carry two 120 gal external drop tanks and bombs at the same time.
