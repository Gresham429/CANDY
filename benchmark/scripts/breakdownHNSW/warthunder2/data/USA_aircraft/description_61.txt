Description of P-38J-15: 
Throughout the many P-38 Lightning variants, one thing rarely changed, the engine nacelles. With the P-38J, also known as Model 422, the engine nacelles and cooling system was revised.  Much of the cooling system was improved, such as a different intercooler and other airframe changes that greatly improved the ability to control the turbochargers. Although the P-38J had the same engine (V-1719-89/91) as the earlier P-38H, the better cooling allowed the P-38J to run at a higher power setting at high altitudes. The power increased by about 13%. The specific J-15 block had a better electrical system but was virtually the same as the earlier P-38J blocks.
