Description of F4U-1C: 
The F4U-1CÂ Corsair was among one of the rarest variants of the F4U Corsair, with only ~200 made, and was the first Corsair to be armed with cannons. The 1C was essentially an F4U-1D with 4 x 20 mm Hispano guns and gave the aircraft a more potent armament against ground targets and aircraft. As good as the guns seemed on paper, in practice it was very different. American pilots found the guns unreliable and excessive against the already lightly armoured Japanese aircraft. Many pilots preferred the M2 Browning machine guns due to their large ammo pool and reliability. Although the new guns made the F4U-1C more deadly, they came at the price of hampering performance with added weight.
