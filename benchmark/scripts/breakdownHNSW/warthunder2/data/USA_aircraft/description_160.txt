Description of A-7E: 
The A-7E was the last version of the Corsair II series used by the US armed services, operational from 1968 until retirement in 1991. Thailand, Portugal, and Greece continued to use the A-7E, with Greece retiring it in 2014.Â  It was a modified A-7D for naval operations with features like an arrestor hook, heavy-duty landing gear, and foldable wings for carrier operations. Upgrades included AN/APN-190 and AN/APQ-128 radars for ground-hugging flight, the aircraft also added hardpoints for the AIM-9D Sidewinder and retained the same capabilities of the A-7D in terms of ground attack.
