History of FJ-4B_VMF-232: 
The FJ-4 was the fourth modification of the Fury - the naval version of the F-86 Sabre, serving primarily with the USMC. Being initially conceived as an all-weather interceptor, the FJ-4 Fury had to incorporate several design changes compared to the previous fighter version in order to fulfill this new role. The most notable change was the increase in range and the installation of new, thinner wing with an increased surface area. To achieve the range increase, the aircraft underwent several structural changes which reduced its weight and allowed for additional fuel tanks to be installed. Additionally, a more powerful Wright J65-W-16A engine, producing 7,700 lbf of thrust, was installed on the production versions. Following successful test flights, production of the FJ-4 commenced in 1955 with first units entering service with the Navy in 1956. Over 150 FJ-4 Fury interceptors were built.
