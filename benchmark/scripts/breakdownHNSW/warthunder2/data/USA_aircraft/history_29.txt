History of P-39N-0: 
The P-39 Airacobra was a single-engine fighter used on the Pacific and Eastern fronts. The aircraft was produced from 1940 to May 1944 by Bell Aircraft, and its first flight was on 6 April 1938. This aircraft was great in low-altitude combat, making it useful in naval battles for escorting torpedo bombers. The original idea for the Airacobra was a defensive interceptor that would protect American shores from the Axis powers. Destroying low-flying torpedoes and normal bombers was not a challenge for this aircraft as it could easily rip the wings and tail. The plane was originally sent to Britain but with technological developments, aircraft became more powerful and engagements were happening higher and higher in the atmosphere, so it was later sent back to the United States. The US then gave the P-39 Airacobra to the Australians, where it was used to patrol the northern shores of Australia. The aircraft was later fitted with bombs and more cannons, forcing it into a ground attack role, meaning it could now penetrate some tanks of the 1939-1942 era. Today, the P-39 Airacobra can be found in the National Museum of the US Air Force and numerous other museums around the world.
