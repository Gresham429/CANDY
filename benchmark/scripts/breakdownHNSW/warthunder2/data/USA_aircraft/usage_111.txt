Usage of Bong%27s_P-38J-15: 
When playing the P-38J climb to a high altitude, search for the enemy, locate the enemy you feel confident in engaging.
Once these steps have been, ticked-off the check-list. Assuming you are above the enemy target: Put the plane into a gradual descent, which gives you and allows you to maintain the speed advantage. As you are descending; make small corrections on your path, so you don't give the element surprise away by overshooting the enemy.
Now you are about one to two seconds away, from your target. Line your sights up, with your sights on the tail and fire a burst with your cannon and machine guns. You have now shot down your target. Why keeping the momentum, climb back up to the height you where before and repeat for the best results.
