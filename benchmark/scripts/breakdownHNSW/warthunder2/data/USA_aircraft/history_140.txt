History of F-86F-2: 
As is well-known, most F-86 Sabre fighters of the USAF that joined the Korean War had six AN/M3 12.7 mm machine guns as their basic weapon configuration against enemy aircraft. Although the experience of the European battlefield during World War II showed that an average of 300 12.7 mm bullets could shoot down an enemy aircraft, the US pilots found that sometimes their 12.7 mm machine guns couldn't easily shoot down enemy MiG fighters even when they scored many hits on them. Though there were also many F-86 fighters that successfully returned to the airfield when they were hit by the 23 mm or 37 mm cannon of the MiG-15 fighter, there was no doubt that the USAF needed a new airborne weapon to replace the aged 12.7 mm machine gun.
