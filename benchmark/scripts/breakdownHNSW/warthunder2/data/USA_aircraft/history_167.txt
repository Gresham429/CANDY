History of A-7K: 
As the United States Air Force was pulling out of South Asia in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, the A-7Ds operating there were returned to the United States. The U.S Department of Defence pushed for these Corsair IIs to be transferred to the U.S Air National Guard, as these aircraft were starting to become obsolete in frontline service, and the LTF-program was almost finished, which would give the Air Force the General Dynamics F-16A Falcon to replace the A-7D in the frontline attack role. The U.S. Air National Guard, unlike the USAF, would ultimately decide that with the transfer of the A-7Ds, they would require a special two-seat training variant to ensure maximum combat training effectiveness on these "new" aircraft.
