History of F2H-2: 
The twin-engine F2H Banshee was a follow up to McDonnell's successful FH-1 Phantom and was designed to become the Navy's next carrier-borne aircraft. The two aircraft appear very similar but the F2H was improved in several ways. Primary upgrades include larger airframe, heavier armament, and better power-plants. Nearly 800 Banshees were built for the Navy and Marine Corps during the early 1950s.
