Usage of AD-4: 
In an air match, you need to know where the most important targets are and immediately make a beeline for them. Using your weight and air-spawn, you can reach a relatively high speed for your airframe of 500 - 600 km/h in an extended shallow dive. Once at the objective area, your mission is to destroy as many vehicles that contribute to your team's victory as possible before enemy interceptors reach you. If possible, use your FFAR rocket payload, as they are incredibly accurate and are able to destroy light pillboxes and all ground vehicles in one direct hit. You can also use your AN/M3 cannons' API-T rounds to penetrate and destroy light pillboxes and light tanks. If this is your goal, use the Universal ammo belt if unlocked, as it means every other round is API-T. Ground targets use two API-T, then a HE-T and a P round, so it is not as effective versus aircraft while being no more effective against ground targets than Universal.
