Description of AD-4: 
The AD-4 Skyraider was an enhanced version of the AD-3 with a more powerful R-3350-26WA engine, strengthened landing gear, increased armament, and a better radar. It played a significant role in the Navy's ground strike missions during the Korean War. One notable air-to-air kill was achieved by a USMC AD-4 in 1953. The Skyraiders, commonly painted blue, were nicknamed the "Blue Plane" by enemy forces in Korea. They were usually shot down due to ground fire during low-altitude attacks. The aircraft also saw action in the Cathay Pacific VR-HEU Incident and later in the Vietnam War. A total of 372 AD-4s were built.
