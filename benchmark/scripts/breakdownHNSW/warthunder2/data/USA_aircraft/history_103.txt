History of P-51D-10: 
In April of 1940, the British Purchasing Commission visited the United States in the hope of securing a new fighter to supplement their Spitfire and Hurricane. They approached the North American Aircraft Company with the proposal to build P-40s under license from Curtiss. Instead, North American proposed the idea of building a brand new superior fighter. The BPC accepted the proposal and the first prototype was set to be completed within 120 days. The design team was led by Lee Atwood, Raymond Rice, and Edgar Schmued (a German-born Austrian who was previously employed by Fokker). They quickly set to work on the new prototype designated NA-73X. The original prototype was assembled in 117 days and first flew on October 26, 1940. A majority of the early Mustangs produced were primarily used for testing by the USAAC. Shortly thereafter 320 NA-73s were ordered by the BPC. The first production model destined for the RAF made its maiden flight on May 1, 1941. The Lend-Lease contract was approved later that year on September 25th. These aircraft were designated Mustang I.
