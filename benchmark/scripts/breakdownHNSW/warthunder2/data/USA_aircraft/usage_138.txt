Usage of F-104A: 
The F-104A is a high-speed, high-altitude fighter-bomber/interceptor. It performs well in high-altitude flights meant to intercept fighters and mainly bombers at high altitudes. When the F-104A is fighting at low altitudes with a slower plane, the pilot should consider a hit-and-run technique to out-speed and return to the target to avoid getting shot back. If you need to turn, be sure to extend your combat flaps as they significantly decrease your turn time.
