Description of P-43A-1: 
The P-43 Lancer was started as a private venture by the Seversky Aircraft Company (later known as Republic) which sought to improve upon its earlier fighter design the P-35. Several design changes turned this fighter into a good platform of which made the leap to the younger sibling, the P-47. When introduced to the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) in 1940, the (Y)P-43 was the only fighter which excelled at high-altitude performance due to its belly-mounted turbo-supercharger and an effective oxygen system to sustain the pilot at those heights. However, despite a short production run in 1941, the USAAC considered the P-43 to be obsolete from its introduction, only using them for training purposes. 125 aircraft were lend-leased to China with the "Flying Tigers" where they found some success against Japanese forces, but they were also found to be less survivable than the P-40 Warhawks that were also in service and were eventually replaced by early 1944.
