Description of P-51H-5-NA: 
The P-51H can rightly be considered the apex of the P-51 Mustang. The P-51H was an evolution from the lightweight Mustang experiments conducted in 1944. The biggest addition to the P-51H was the Packard Merlin V-1659-9. It featured an automatic boost control system and water injection. With water injection enabled, the V-1659 could produce a whopping 2,000+ hp although only for short bursts. The P-51H also featured extensive airframe modifications like a shorter carburetor air intake and longer fuselage. In preparation for the upcoming invasion of Japan, around 2,000 P-51Hs were ordered. However, the war was nearing its end and many orders were canceled. The P-51H would never see combat in either the Pacific or   European theatres.
