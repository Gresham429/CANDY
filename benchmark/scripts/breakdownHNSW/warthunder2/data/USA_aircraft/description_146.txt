Description of AV-8C: 
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) adopted the AV-8A Harrier in 1971 for their amphibious operations, being part of the USMC's ambitious goals of utilizing the Harrier's V/STOL capabilities to operate from rudimentary airfields and smaller carriers while being able to provide close air support needed on land. Needs for improvements has the USMC seek out the more advanced Harrier II, but until enough number of Harrier II is available, the USMC sought to improve their AV-8A fleet with upgrades and improvements to keep them relevant. In 1979, 47 AV-8A were selected for improvements into the AV-8C that saw the integration of a radar warning receiver (RWR) and countermeasures into the airframe, avionic upgrades, and service life extension. The AV-8C and preceding AV-8A variant would both be retired in 1987.
