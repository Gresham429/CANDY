Usage of B-29A-BN: 
The ultimate strategic bomber for the USAF. Loaded up with eight metric tonnes of bombs and twelve good ol' Browning heavy machine guns, this is the Superfortress. A wonderful advertising name, but don't be fooled, it is bigger than a barn and thus impossible to miss. Keep a safe distance from any hot combat zones. Your defensive turrets will not keep you safe, they will shred any foe getting close, but the B-29's enemies do not need to. So concentrate on what this plane is good at; delivering payload, and lots of it.
