Description of F2G-1: 
Goodyear Aircraft Company was one of two companies that were building F4U Corsairs during World War 2. GAC decided to take a chance in developing the F2G, also known as the Super Corsair. The F2G-1 was a land-based variant intended to be a low-altitude interceptor while the F2G-2 was intended for naval operations. GAC planned to modify the original Corsair airframe with improvements like a new bubble-type canopy. The most notable addition was the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major, a 28-cylinder radial engine that could produce an impressive 3,000 horsepower. Ten F2Gs were produced until production was canceled in 1945 due to the superior F8F Bearcat. Performance deficiencies in testing and engine issues also doomed the Super Corsair from further production.
