Description of AD-2: 
The AD-2 Skyraider Skyraider was designed during WWII for the US Navy but didn't see action in that war, for said purpose it was meant to carry bombs and torpedoes just like the dive and torpedo bombers in service. It had a more powerful Wright engine. The aircraft never served in WWII, but it did serve during the Korean and Vietnam War. There were very few differences between the AD-1, AD-2 and AD-3, with the AD-4 being the first with very major improvements in the Skyraider series.
