History of Fw_190_A-8_(USA): 
On January 1, 1945, an Fw 190 A-8 (W.Nr. 681497) flown by Corporal Walter Wagner from 4./JG 4 landed at the allied-held field at St Trond, Belgium, after having been hit by flak and being forced to make an emergency landing during Operation Bodenplatte. From here it was transferred to the 404th Fighter Group, USAAF.[1][2] It was later repainted.
