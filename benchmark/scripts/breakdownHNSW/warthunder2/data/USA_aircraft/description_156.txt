Description of F-8E: 
The United States Navy showed clear interest in expanding the capabilities of the Crusader series of aircraft as quickly as possible to expand its role in maritime operations and offer primitive close-air support capabilities. This led to the development of the F8U-2NE (later renamed the F-8E), which featured a larger nose cone, new AN/APQ-94 fire control radar, detachable pylons, a more reliable J57-P-20 engine, and guidance equipment for the AGM-12 Bullpup missiles. The first prototype, a modified F8U-1 (No. 143710), was flown on June 30, 1961, and the aircraft was quickly approved for use by the Navy. During the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps made extensive use of the F-8E, with squadrons like VMFA-235 considered to be among the best at using the aircraft in combat.
