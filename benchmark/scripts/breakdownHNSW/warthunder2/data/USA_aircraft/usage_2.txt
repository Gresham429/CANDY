Usage of P-26A-33: 
Like most US fighters, the P-26A-33 Peashooter is a decent energy fighter even though its high lift creates unstable diving characteristics. Despite being a monoplane, the P-26 is not the fastest reserve fighter. In most regards the P-26A-33 will be outmatched by enemy fighters; for example, the Japanese Ki-10s will not only turn circles around the P-26A-33 but will out-climb it and out-run it too. However, the slow German He 51 makes an easy target for a P-26A. P-26 pilots should instead focus on attacking and harassing enemy bombers.
