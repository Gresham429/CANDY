Description of YP-38: 
The YP-38 was developed after the loss of the only XP-38. It was intended to be a pre-production aircraft fitted with armament; two 7.62 mm machine guns, two 12.7 mm machine guns, and one 37 mm cannon. All were to be mounted in the nose however some YP-38s never received their weaponry. The YP-38 managed to shave off over 14,000 lbs (6,350 kg) from the original XP-38. In addition, the YP-38 also had its propellor direction reversed (outward rather than inwards) which greatly improved stability when firing the guns. In late 1940, the first YP-38s were completed and were later sent to the U.S. Army. Although it was redesigned and significantly lost weight, the YP-38 had major issues with high-speed dives. During a test flight, a YP-38 broke up during a high-speed dive and subsequently killed the pilot. It would take Lockheed two years to find out the true source of the issue during wind tunnel testing.
