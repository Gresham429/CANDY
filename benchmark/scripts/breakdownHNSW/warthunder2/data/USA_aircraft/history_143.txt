History of F8U-2: 
In the early 1950s, the US Air Force and US Navy both realized that with the arrival of the supersonic age, they both needed to develop new fighters to meet the new challenges in the mid and late 1950s. The US Air Force's answer was the North American Aviation Sabre-45 program, this program would be later developed into the famous F-100 Super Sabre that entered service in 1954. But by contrast with the US Air Force, the birth of the first supersonic fighter of the US Navy was much more complicated.
