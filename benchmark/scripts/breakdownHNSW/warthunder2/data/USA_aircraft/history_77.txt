History of B-17E/L: 
The B-17E Flying Fortress was an improved version of the B-17D and earlier B-17 variants. It featured a tail gunner's position and a rotating dorsal turret behind the cockpit; both turret had an armament of two .50 cal M2 Browning machine guns. Previously, the B-17 had a blind spot at the rear, where no gunners could fire. The tail gunner's position allowed protection from the rear. To fit the new tail gunner's position, the fuselage had to be up-sized. A larger, redesigned vertical stabilizer was also added to the tail. Additionally, the teardrop shaped sliding panels at the waist gunners' stations were replaced by rectangular windows. This increased visibility from those positions. On the first 1/5 of the production run, the B-17E was equipped with a ventral remote-controlled Sperry turret.
