Usage of P-47D-25: 
The Thunderbolt was used as a high altitude bomber escort and excels at fighter roles in the game, but it can also be used as a very effective ground attack aircraft, thanks to its impressive bomb load. With the equivalent of 3,000 lbs of ordnance under its wings with munitions such as 1,000 lb bombs and 10 HVAR rockets, it is an excellent fighter-bomber. In this role, its performance is often superior to even dedicated ground attack aircraft such as IL-2 Sturmoviks. Its eight fifty-calibre guns are effective against soft targets which aren't worth rockets or bombs. With good aim, they can destroy light pillboxes when firing through the pillbox window on the sides, especially if using the "Ground targets" belt.
