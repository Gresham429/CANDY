History of B-57B: 
The Martin B-57B was a development of the licence-built version of the British Canberra B Mk 2, the B-57A. After its impressive performances at the Farnborough airshows in the early 1950s, the United States of America were keen to acquire the record setting jet bomber to fulfil the role of fast attacker similar to their current A-26 model. America had no suitable replacements for the Invader's position and experiences in Korea had proven the value of an Interdiction attacker.
