Description of P-400: 
The P-400 was the American redesignation for the export model of the P-39 Airacobra, intended to be sent to Britain and other Allies. It was equipped with a 20 mm Hispano cannon in the nose, rather than the typical 37 mm of other models. Britain ordered 675 P-39s (redesignated as the "Airacobra Mk I") starting in September 1940; however, once they began to arrive in September 1941, it was quickly found that they had inadequate climb rate and high-altitude performance, and only 80 were operated. 200 were later sent from Britain to the Soviet Union. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US requisitioned another 200 of the units intended to be sent to Britain (redesignating them "P-400"), some of which were later sent on for use in the RAAF.
