Usage of B-10B: 
As a bomber, the B-10B does the job well. It can easily reach bombing points before interception and can level a base with a single 2,000 lb bomb, and can then turn away and return to base to rearm. If enemy fighters are at altitude, consider using clouds for cover, or entering a shallow dive towards friendly fighters, or the airfield.
