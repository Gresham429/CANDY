Description of P-51A: 
The P-51A was one of the first variants of the P-51. It is quite similar to the A-36, which is essentially a ground-attack-focused P-51. One of the main improvements of the P-51A over previous Mustangs is the uprated engine. The Allison V-1710-81 inline 12-cylinder engine could produce up to 1,200 hp and could sustain much of that at higher altitudes thanks to its supercharger. It was also fitted with a bigger propeller, which further increased performance. The P-51A would be one of the fastest fighters at the time, thanks to its unique design and powerful engine. In addition to its excellent performance, the P-51A was armed with four 12.7 mm machine guns in the wings. However, due to the thin wings and cramped nature, the machine guns had frequent jams. A significant number of P-51As were sent to the Royal Air Force and served for much of the war. Over 1,500 P-51As were produced until the superior Merlin engine became available for the Mustang.
