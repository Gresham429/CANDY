Description of FJ-4B_VMF-232: 
The VMF-232 squadron of the Marine Corps, nicknamed "Red Devils", was known for using the FJ-4B in the 1950s, specifically between 1956 and 1959, after gathering experience with the FJ-2 and FJ-3. The squadron and their FJ-4Bs were deployed on USS Bennington during the Quemoy Matsu Crisis in 1958, and later transferred to Naval Air Facility Atsugi. In 1958, the squadron flew more than 10,000 hours. After their deployment ended, VMF-232's FJ-4Bs started to be replaced by the introduction of the first batch of F-8 Crusaders.
