History of A-20G-25: 
In 1936 a design team from Douglas Aircraft set out to create a light bomber. The design would be based around a high mounted wing and tricycle landing gear. It was to be powered by a pair of 450 hp Pratt & Whitney engines. It was known as the Douglas Model 7A. The projected was shelved with design work nearly halfway completed. Based on information from the Spanish Civil War, the U.S. Army put out a specification for a new aeroplane. The requirements was a cruising speed of 200 mph and a range of 1,200 miles. It was to also consist of a 1,200 lb bomb load. Douglas then revised the design to meet these requirements. It was known as the Douglas Model 7B.
