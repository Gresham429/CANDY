Description of F-104C: 
The F-104C mainly differs from early variants by being able to carry ground munitions. Although it may have seemed strange considering the overall unstable nature of the Starfighter, the Tactical Air Command decided to propose a ground striker version of the Starfighter. Almost 80 F-104Cs were ordered and had its first flight in 1958. More orders were planned until Starfighter production was rejected. The F-104C also features a better engine that increased thrust by about 7% thanks to the 3-inch increase in the turbine's diameter. Minor changes included an inflight refuelling probe and a better fire control system. The F-104Cs saw service in Vietnam where they were soon replaced by the superior F-4D Phantom. The Starfighter always had a troubled history and the F-104C was no exception despite the various improvements.
