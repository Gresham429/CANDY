Description of P-38G-1: 
The P-38G was a minor evolution of the P-38 and was also widely produced with over 1,000 aircraft built. The P-38G was largely the same aircraft as the P-38F except the G ran at higher boost settings as well as having improved radio equipment. The Allison V-1710-51 in the P-38G (F10R) runs at a slightly higher manifold pressure (47.5) compared to the engine in the P-38F (47.0). Unfortunately, due to cooling issues with the engines at higher altitudes, the power was significantly limited. A decent portion of P-38Gâ€™s were actually F-5A Lightnings that were unarmed and fitted with five cameras for reconnaissance duties. These received the same improvements found in the P-38G and were built along the same production lines.
