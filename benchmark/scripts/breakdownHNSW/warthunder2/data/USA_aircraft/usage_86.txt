Usage of Kingcobra_(USA): 
Like the regular P-63C-5 aircraft is an improved version of the P-63A-10 carrying the same armament and main gun. The aircraft is still a high altitude interceptor/ Energy fighter, with its turn radius slightly better than before. The quick dive speed and high energy retention allows the player, with the correct altitude, to engage opponents below numerous times using the high yo-yo method. This aircraft should not be used for ground attacking due to its average ammo count.
