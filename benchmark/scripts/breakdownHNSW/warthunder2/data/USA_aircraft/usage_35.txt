Usage of F2A-3: 
The characteristics of the F2A-3 means that its pilots shouldn't try to turn-fight their opponents and that they should also strictly maintain their energy. However, its weight and energy retention ability mean that any Buffalo pilot that cares to climb high (3,000 - 4,000 m) will be able to combat opponents with relative ease. However, they should be wary of adept climbers (such as Bf 109s and the US' own P-47, at least in Arcade) as they are more than a match for the F2A's climb rate. In a dive, the Buffalo can rapidly catch up to virtually anything it faces, and, when it does, a battery of 4 x .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns will make short work of any target, save well-armoured bombers such as the B-25 or Ju 88, which an F2A pilot will probably rarely meet.
