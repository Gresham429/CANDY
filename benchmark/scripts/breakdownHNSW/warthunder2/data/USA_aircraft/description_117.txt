Description of AU-1: 
The AU-1 was a variant of the F4U Corsair developed from the F4U-5, and was originally designated as the F4U-6 but was renamed to AU-1. It was designed as a dedicated ground attack aircraft, unlike all the previous Corsairs which were designed as fighters. To fit that role the engine was optimized for low-altitude flight, additional armour was fitted, and the AU-1 had increased suspended armament capacity. The United States Marine Corps utilized the AU-1 in Korea starting in 1952, saw service in the Naval reserves from 1954 to early 1956 before it was officially retired in 1957.
