History of PBM-1_%22Mariner%22: 
During the 1930s the United States had a vibrant seaplane making industry making ever larger flying boat category of seaplanes. Sikorsky, Boeing, Grumman, Consolidated (of PBY fame), and Martin all vied for the lucrative opportunities of an aircraft that could land almost anywhere on earth with little investment in facilities. Advances in technology lead the US Navy created a few new "system designation" in 1935, with "PB" for "Patrol Bomber" being one of them. Glenn L. Martin company leveraged its considerable flying boat and bomber aircraft experience to design a new aircraft for the requirements of long range with considerable offensive ability and bomb load. In many ways similar to the PBY, it was superior in having internal bomb bay, providing a performance advantage when fully loaded (commonly posted stats often do not list fully loaded performance). It was also larger, more complex, and 50% heavier.
