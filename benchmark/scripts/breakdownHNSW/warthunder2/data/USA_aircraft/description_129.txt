Description of F9F-8: 
The F9F-8 Cougar (Design 99) was Grumman’s final fighter iteration of the Cougar. It was intended to have improved flight characteristics such as a lower stall speed and better control at high angles of attack. The wing had a thinner cross section which increased the top speed. In addition, the center fuselage was increased by 8 inches which helped with the stall speed. Around 600 F9F-8s were delivered to the U.S. Navy. F9F-8 crews found the plane to be quite good and reliable: however, new supersonic jets quickly made the Cougar obsolete and its service was cut short. Some F9Fs were to be utilized as trainer aircraft, but no Cougars would actively serve in the Vietnam War.
