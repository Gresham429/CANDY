Description of OS2U-3: 
The OS2U-3 Kingfisher is the successor of the OS2U-1 and the OS2U-2, which was a version equipped with a regular landing gear. Compared to this previous versions, it uses a slightly different engine, the same Pratt & Whitney R-985-48 but with a different version, it also has increased range, thanks to the addition of two extra self sealing fuel tanks in the wings while also featuring improved armour for the pilot. The OS2U-3 was the most produced variant of the Kingfisher family with 1000 units built. This aircraft first flew in 1941 and it was the only exported variant of all the Kingfishers, it served in many countries from Uruguay to Australia including the Soviet Union aboard cruiser Murmansk (USS Milwaukee). The last Kingfishers were withdrawn from service in Cuba in 1959.
