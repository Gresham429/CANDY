History of F-16C: 
Concluding MSIP III, the Block 40/42 F-16CG/DG "Night Falcon" fleet weighed 3,000+ lbs over the original F-16A/B fleet. Intended to carry more armament than the original A/Bs, the CG/DGs had their airframes strengthened compared to even the fairly recent CD/DDs, and had improved avionics, as the primary intent behind the Night Falcon: LANTIRN integration. While this wasn't as much of a problem for the Block 40s, the Block 42s suffered heavily, still using the F100-PW-220E introduced with the Block 25. These engines still produced roughly the same thrust as the original F100-PW-200s that was featured on the F-16As.
