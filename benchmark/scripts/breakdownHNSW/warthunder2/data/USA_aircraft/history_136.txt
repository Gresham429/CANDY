History of A2D-1: 
The Douglas A-1 Skyraider was an impressive aircraft for a piston-driven propeller-powered aircraft which survived into the jet age, being used by the United States Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force and around nine other countries over its 40-year service. Like many aircraft which were successful, they went through many iterations and variants to keep them up to date with new requirements and technology as they came about. In an age where jet aircraft were beginning to overtake propeller-driven aircraft in all aspects of military service, the Bureau of Aeronautics which was the U.S. Navy's material-support organization was looking for a suitable option for an attack aircraft which would be more fuel-efficient than the upcoming jet fighters. To meet the Navy's requirement, Douglas Aircraft looked to their AD Skyraider airframe and considered modifying it to accept a more fuel economical turboprop engine.
