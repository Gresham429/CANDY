Usage of F-80C-10: 
Like most American fighters, your best option to attack is Boom and Zoom. At the start of the match, fly out towards the edge of the map. Climb at 2-3 degrees until you have reached ~770 km/h (~420 knots) at ~910 metres (~3,000 ft), then zoom climb at 20-30 degrees. Once you have slowed down to 287 km/h (155 kt), continue to climb at a solid 10 degrees. Optimally, you should have between 3.7-4.9 km (12,000-16,000 ft) depending on how high the highest enemy is, before turning towards the area of conflict (continue to climb or maintain altitude). Only once you have selected a target should you dive and make your pass. Always keep your energy high, whether it be speed or altitude. Because the F-80 is frequently uptiered, the best option is to dive on unsuspecting targets that are occupied engaging your teammates.
