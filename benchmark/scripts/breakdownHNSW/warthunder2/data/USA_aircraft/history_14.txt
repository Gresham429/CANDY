History of SBD-3: 
The SBD ("Scout Bomber Douglas") was introduced in 1940 and was produced by Douglas until 1944. However its roots go further than that. The predecessor of the SBD, the Northrop BT-1, was designed in 1935. In 1937, Northrop Corporation was taken over by Douglas, and the Northrop BT-2, developed from the BT-1, served as a basis of what was to become the SBD. In 1938, the US Navy and US Marine Corps placed orders for a new dive bomber designated SBD-1 and SBD-2. The SBD-1 was delivered to the Marines in 1940 and the SBD-2 to the Navy in early 1941, replacing obsolete SBU Corsair and SBC Helldiver carrier-based dive bombers. The SBD, unusually for a carrier aircraft, did not possess folding wings - the designers opted to maintain the structural integrity of the plane instead. The next version, SBD-3, had increased armour protection, self-sealing fuel tanks, and the rear gunner's 7.62 mm Browning M1919 machine gun was switched to a dual-mount instead of the single mount on previous aircraft. The most produced version of SBD was SBD-5, over 2,400 of these were built, equipped with more powerful 1,200 hp Wright R-1820-60 Cyclone engines and increased ammo supply. The US Army Air Force used denavalized variants of the SBD, called the A-24 Banshee. These were flown during the early stages of the war, but quickly withdrawn from service.
