Description of F2A-3: 
The final version of the Brewster Buffalo was the F2A-3. Parts of the F2A-3's airframe were revised and the fuel capacity was increased to 908 L (240 gal). Although the fuel capacity was increased, the engine stayed the same which greatly diminished performance. The climb rate, top speed, and overall flight performance fell and pilots didn't enjoy flying it. The US Navy grew tired and annoyed at Brewster's constant issues with delivering aircraft on time and other problems. Squadrons using the F2A-3 quickly switched to the F4F Wildcat and were eventually sent to the Marine Corps. The F2A-3 saw its first major combat in the Battle of Midway where Buffalo pilots were hopelessly outmatched by A6M Zeroes. High-ranking officials within the US armed forces were greatly disappointed by the F2A-3's performance. Captain Phillip R. White would later say, "It is my belief that any commander who orders pilots out for combat in a F2A-3 should consider the pilot lost before leaving the ground." This marked the end of the Buffalo in active service and all Buffalos were relegated to training.
