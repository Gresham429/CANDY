Description of F3H-2: 
The F3H-2 Demon was a big improvement over the F3H-1N. Significant issues with the Westinghouse J40 almost killed the Demon project. As the J40 was being remedied, McDonnell inquired to the Navy about a new powerplant in case the J40 was deemed too far gone. After authorization, McDonnell chose the Allison J71 engine which was a vast improvement over the previous J40. Unlike previous versions of the Demon, the F3H-2 could launch the more advanced AIM-7C Sparrow. It could also carry AIM-9B Sidewinders and up to 6,000 lbs of ordnance. Although the F3H-2 was deemed somewhat favorable by its crews, newer and more advanced aircraft like the F-8 Crusader and F-4 Phantom numbered the Demonâ€™s days. Finally, in 1964,  the last naval squadron using Demons, VF-161, switched them out for the new Phantoms.
