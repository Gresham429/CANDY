Usage of A2D-1: 
In Arcade and Realistic Battles, the A2D-1 can climb with no extra armament to become top cover for the allied fighters, or alternatively escort bombers to their designation. It can also carry one of its most hard hitting armaments and destroy several ground targets or destroy two bases. Though in Simulator Battles the jittery controls and lack of control make it more akin to a B-57B fast jet bomber.
