Description of F-89B: 
The F-89B Scorpion was designed and built to be an all-weather interceptor intended to neutralize any potential invading Soviet bomber force. The USAAF was intent on replacing the P-61 Black Widow with another night fighter, specifically one which would fly faster (minimum 850 km/h (530 mph)) almost assuredly requiring the usage of jets, and be armed with six .60 calibre (15 mm) machine guns or 20 mm autocannons and internally stored aerial rockets. To round out the aircraft for ground attack if needed, it would also need to be able to accommodate 1,000 lb bombs and eight larger rocket types externally. Initial wind tunnel testing of the fighter determined that the proposed swept wings were insufficient at slow speeds and were changed out with straight wings. Though causing a loss of high-end performance, increased stability at low speeds was necessary. The F-89B was a direct upgrade over the F-89A, featuring mostly upgraded avionics, while the rest of the aircraft remained the same. It was designed to intercept early jet-powered bombers, and it was fitted with an afterburner, which was not very common for the time. Other changes to the horizontal stabilizer also increased the effectiveness of the elevators and rudder. Concerns about the fuel tanks situated right over the engines were nullified when it was determined that efforts made by Northrop to protect them were considered sufficient, anything else would have required a complete redesign of the aircraft.
