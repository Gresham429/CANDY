Usage of YP-38: 
The YP-38 climbs just as well as a Bf 109, and can make use of a 20 degree sustained climb. However, it cannot turn fight and has quite bad yaw (most likely due to it being twin-engine and having small rudders). Overall, it has bad manoeuvrability, but good acceleration due to having two engines. Make use of the flaps accordingly and you will get better or at least decent mobility in below 190 km/h speed. Due to your good climb rate and slow agility, your best tactic is to hunt bombers. Usually, at this BR, bombers do not climb high or try to speed bomb, bringing them to a low final altitude. You can use your .50 cals and 7.62 mm MGs to shoot out their engines, but it is better to take careful aim and use the 37 mm as its HE shell is quite potent. Depending on armour, it can take 1 to 2, even 3 hits to rip a wing or the fuselage using the HE only belt. These shells have quite slow muzzle velocity compared to MGs but it is worth the time in practising to aim them well as it takes out fighters and twin-engine interceptors like the Bf 110s or Me 410s with a single shot. Against other fighters, it is recommended to fly a Boom and Zoom tactic to any engagement you see fit.
