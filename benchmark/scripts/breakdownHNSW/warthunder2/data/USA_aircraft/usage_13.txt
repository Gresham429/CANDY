Usage of TBF-1C: 
As with all torpedo bombers, maintain low altitude, high speed, and fighter cover. The optimal distance for launching a torpedo is 1 km from the target. Engage enemy ships from directly ahead or astern which makes "leading" the target much easier. If torpedo bombing is not an option, the TBF-1C can carry bombs for attacking ground targets.
