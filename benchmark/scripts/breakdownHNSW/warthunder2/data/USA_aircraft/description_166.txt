Description of F-5A: 
The F-5’s roots begin way back in the mid-1950s. After a tour around Europe and Asia, Northrop’s team saw the need for a supersonic fighter that was cheap and easy to maintain. In 1955, the N-156 was formally brought into fruition and work began. It ultimately evolved into the N-156F and although the Navy and Air Force weren’t interested in it, Northrop pursued the idea. Several years later in 1962, the DoD formally announced that the N-156F would be its chosen aircraft for the Military Assistance Program (MAP). This led to the F-5A serving with U.S. forces as a cheap and easy-to-maintain fighter and ultimately being one of the best export-type fighters ever built.
