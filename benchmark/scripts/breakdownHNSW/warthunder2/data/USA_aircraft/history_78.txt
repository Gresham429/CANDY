History of PB4Y-2: 
The Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer was a heavy bomber & maritime patrol aircraft used by the United States Navy developed from the PB4Y-1, a minor modification of the B-24 Liberator used by the United States during WWII. The aircraft was a fully-navalized version of the B-24 featuring a taller single vertical stabilizer, a flight engineer's station and modified armament. The aircraft were used towards the end of the Second World War, and were used after the war as patrol aircraft by various countries. Some converted Privateers served as firefighters into the early 2000s; all aircraft are now retired from service, though two airframes are still fully airworthy.
