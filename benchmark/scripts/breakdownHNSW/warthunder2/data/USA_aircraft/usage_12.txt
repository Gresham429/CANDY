Usage of SB2U-3: 
The SB2U-3 is a carrier based dive bomber. This aircraft is a fairly slow aircraft, but sturdy. Built as a dive-bomber, it excels at diving down above a target to release its bombs. The SB2U is one of the only early aircraft in War Thunder which features dive flaps (h) to aid in retarding the build up of speed during a dive, helping prevent ripping off of wings in RB and SB. Wing mounted machine guns allow for this aircraft to strafe softer ground or water targets while waiting for bombs to reload (AB). Rear facing dorsal gunner helps to ward off enemy attackers, however it is not a game changer for this aircraft.
