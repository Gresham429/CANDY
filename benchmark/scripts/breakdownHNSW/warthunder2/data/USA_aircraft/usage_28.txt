Usage of P-38G-1: 
The P-38G-1 is a medium- and high-altitude fighter which excels in anti-bomber roles and when working with teammates to destroy enemy fighters. Its manoeuvrability is unsurprisingly worse than that of single-engine fighters, but is quite good compared to that of other heavy fighters. The plane excels in a boom and zoom roll, where its powerful armament and good energy retention are brought into the spotlight.
