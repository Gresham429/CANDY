Usage of F-80A-5: 
This F-80 must be flown strictly as Boom-and-Zoom, or Boom-and-Run. Anything else does not work due to the aircraft's inferior acceleration compared to props and some Axis jets at certain speeds. While its manoeuvring energy retention (MER) is relatively poor - as with most early jets - its vertical and horizontal energy retention (ER) is decent.
