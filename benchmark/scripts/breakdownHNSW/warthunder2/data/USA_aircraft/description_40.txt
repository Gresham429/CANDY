Description of F4U-1A_(USMC): 
The F4U-1A (USMC) is a variation of the F4U-1A that mainly served with the U.S. Marine Corps. Although the Corsair was originally intended for the U.S. Navy, the Corsair fit right in with the USMC. The Marine Corps successfully used Corsairs and many pilots favored the Corsair over obsolete aircraft like the F2A. Lieutenant Kenneth A. Walsh stated, “The F4U could outperform a Zero in every aspect except slow speed manoeuvrability and slow speed rate of climb.” Also, the F4U-1A lacked any water injection system until they were retrofitted after an experimental F4U-1A with the system was test flown.
