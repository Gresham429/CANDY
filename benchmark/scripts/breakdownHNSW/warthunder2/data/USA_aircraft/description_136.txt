Description of A2D-1: 
In 1945, the Bureau of Aeronautics assigned Douglas Aircraft Company the task of creating an innovative carrier-based attack aircraft with a jet engine, intended to eventually supersede the nascent AD Skyraider. Douglas development led to the US Navy considering a prototype using an Allison XT40A turboprop engine with counter-rotating propellers. This prototype, designated XA2D-1, had continual engine problems and it didn't take its first flight until 26 May 1950. Continual problems with the engine and gearbox continued with further delay and all-jet designs coming into service led to the XA2D-1's cancellation in 1954 with a total of 2 XA2D-1 and 10 pre-production A2D-1 units produced.
