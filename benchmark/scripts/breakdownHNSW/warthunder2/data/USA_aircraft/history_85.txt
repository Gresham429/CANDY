History of XF5F: 
The Grumman XF5F Skyrocket was a prototype twin engine, carrier-borne, interceptor aircraft; developed for the United States Navy. In January 1938, the U.S. Navy issued a specification calling for a lightweight carrier-based fighter / interceptor to replace the obsolete biplanes which were in use at the time. Five companies issued proposals, of which Grumman, Vought and Bell received contracts to produce a prototype. Grumman produced the XF5F Skyrocket, to complete with Vought's XF4U-1 Corsair (the prototype of the legendary F4U Corsair), and Bell's XFL Airabonita (a naval version of the P-39 Airacobra).
