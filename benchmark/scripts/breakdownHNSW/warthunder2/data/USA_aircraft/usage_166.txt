Usage of F-5A: 
As the F-5A does not have any radar-guided missiles (AIM-7s or equivalent), and it's not particularly fast, it is recommended to stay low and try to avoid the first clash between teams by flying to the side. When flying into the aforementioned engagement zone, pick out single fights or distracted enemies. The AIM-9E is not a reliable weapon and is easy to dodge, so try not to take missile shots from the sides or at a heavily manoeuvring opponent. When the opportunity to dogfight arises, take it only when you're sure other enemies are either distanced or far enough away from your position to not interrupt your fight and pick you off. When in a dogfight, you are almost always superior in manoeuvrability when compared to your opponent. MiG-21s or the J35s will be better in the first turn, but they bleed a lot of speed due to their delta wing design. Avoid their guns in the first turn, and use yours to take them out. While you have only 2 guns, they have a high muzzle velocity, making them easy to aim. The only downside with the cannons is their damage potential: you need to put several rounds on a target to destroy it.
