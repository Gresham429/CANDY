Description of F2A-1: 
The Brewster F2A Buffalo was a revolutionary carrier-based monoplane designed to replace the outdated biplanes that were previously in service with the United States Navy. It was introduced as a much-needed upgrade to the fleet's aircraft, boasting impressive features such as a 950 horsepower engine and a total of four machine guns. The armament of the F2A-1 was distributed across different parts of the aircraft, with two machine guns of different calibers (a .50 cal or 12.7 mm and a .30 cal or 7.62 mm) situated in the nose, and two more machine guns on each wing, making it a formidable fighter.
