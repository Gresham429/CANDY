Usage of P-40F-10: 
The P-40F-10 performs similarly to the P-40E-1, although it is neither as fast (at lower altitudes) nor as good at turning. Although this is compensated with the new Merlin engine, providing a better performance at higher altitudes, as well as the re-designed tail section, which allows a better elevator control at higher speeds, making it a very competitive aircraft when using Boom and Zoom tactics. It can also take a good amount of machine gun hits while keeping the critical modules safe; however, cannons will pose a more serious threat specially if they hit the wings. This aircraft comes too with a good fire power, which considering all the characteristics listed previously, allows for the pilot to choose from different tactics as well as objectives when engaging enemy aircraft.
