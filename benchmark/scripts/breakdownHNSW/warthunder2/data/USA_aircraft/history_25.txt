History of B-10B: 
The B-10 started out as a private venture by Glenn L. Martin Company in 1932 as the Martin Model 123. It had a number of features that were revolutionary at the time. These included an internal bomb bay, retractable landing gear, and rotating gun turrets. The model 123 did not have fully enclosed crew stations; there were 4 crewmembers. The Model 123 was delivered to the Army for testing in March of 1932, and was designated as the XB-907. It was sent back to Martin for redesigning and was designated as the XB-10. It differed from the Model 123 in that it had a full engine cowling, larger wingspan, fully enclosed crew stations, and a reduction in crew to 3. The Army ordered 48 in 1933, and the first 14 were designated as YB-10, and served as mail carriers for the Army Air Corps Mail Operation.
