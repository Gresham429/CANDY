Description of F4U-1D: 
When the first F4U Corsairs were accepted in naval aviation services, the low visibility offered by its design caused complications in carrier landing, thus it was relegated to land operations among units like the United States Marine Corps Squadrons. Back in the factories, the F4U continued to be improved as user's experience and technology trickled into the design. This led to the installation of a more powerful Double Wasp engine, and accommodations for more ordnance as rockets and bombs that could be carried for the ground attack role, as well as being able to use external fuel tanks for extra range. The improved Corsair, designated the F4U-1DÂ Corsair as produced by Vought, or FG-1D as produced by Goodyear, came in right as the US Navy began to accept the F4U Corsair for carrier operations. The first US Corsair squadron based on a carrier would be the USMC VMF-214 on the USS Essex with F4U-1Ds in December 1944. The F4U-1Ds would see service for the remainder of the war, even as improved Corsairs continued coming in.
