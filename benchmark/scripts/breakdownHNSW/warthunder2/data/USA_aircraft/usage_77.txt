Usage of B-17E/L: 
When using the B-17E/Late Flying Fortress, you are not invincible, but the B-17 is notorious for being able to take one serious punch and still get you home. However, at your battle rating, you aren't going to have too much room for error. Nonetheless, as mentioned earlier, you have minimal nose defences which leave the pilot and co-pilot dangerously exposed.
