Usage of P-51: 
In an RPG the Mustang would be a rogue, the damage dealer. Quickly darting in and out of combat to deal devastating blows, the P-51 in War Thunder is a DPS main, too. Featured playstyles are Boom & Zoom, repeatedly diving on enemies and returning up high, and Boom & Run, flying into danger zone, picking of a target and retreating, all while running at top speed. Coupled with its manoeuvrability and acceleration deficits, the P-51 punishes any pilot who does not play to its strength, namely the top speed. Only late war or diving aircraft are able to catch a Mustang on the run and for the latter only with the correct timing and plenty of altitude to burn. Maintaining a cool head and areal observation are important. Retreating may look the cowardice choice, but with the speed to disengage many options open up for reversals. Note, do not perform flat turns, but rather slow, deliberate high Yo-Yos or Immelmanns for turning around. A careful approach when leading up for a shot helps in conserving precious momentum, too.
