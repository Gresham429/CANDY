Description of P-61A-11: 
The P-61A was the first production variant of the P-61 "Black Widow". Production started in 1943 and differed from the YP-61 by being painted in an olive drab color. Some P-61As were built without the turret due to the B-29 bomber program and problems with the turret during high speed dives. A significant portion had the turret fixed pointing forward and would be controlled by the pilot instead of the gunner. Also, the gunner never flew on certain missions since his main job, controlling the turret, wasn't needed and missions were carried out with only the pilot and radio operator. With the A-5 block, the engines were replaced from the R-2800-10s to the more powerful R-2800-65 and increased the top speed and climb rate. The next block, the A-10, featured the all-important water injection system and returned to the black paint scheme. The A-11 was a modification of the A-10 and only added an extra pylon for either fuel or bombs. Only 20 P-61A-10s were modified to A-11 standards.
