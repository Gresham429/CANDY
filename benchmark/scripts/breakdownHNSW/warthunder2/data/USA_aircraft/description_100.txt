Description of B-17G-60-VE: 
The Boeing B-17G is the main serial production variant of the famous "Flying Fortress" first produced in 1943. Using lessons learned from operating the previous B-17E/F models, several changes were made on the G model, with some carried from the troublesome F model. This include a pressurised cabin, the addition of a chin remote-controlled turret and improved cheek turret mount to counter frontal engagements, moving the right waist gunner position towards to front to increase the overall coverage, improved superchargers for high-altitude operation, and receiving the "Cheyenne" tail turret which increased protection and the field of fire for the tail gunner. Around 8,680 B-17Gs were built, with several airframes being converted as a testbed for various projects.
