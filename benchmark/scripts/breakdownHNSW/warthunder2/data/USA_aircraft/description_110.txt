Description of A-1H: 
By the Vietnam War, the AD Skyraiders had an extensive combat record with the USA since the Korean War. Seven major variants of the aircraft was produced, numbered AD-1 to AD-7. As part of the 1962 Tri-service designation system, the Skyraider was redesigned into "A-1", with letters A-J to represent each variant. The AD-6, now known as the A-1H, would be the most numerous produced at 712 units and would serve as an essential ground support aircraft for the US throughout the Vietnam War. The A-1H's had one of its most memorable moment come in October 1965 when Commander Clarence J. Stoddard of the US Navy, to commemorate the 6 millionth pound of ordnance dropped, included a mounted toilet in his munitions load and dropped it in combat operations.
