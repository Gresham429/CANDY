History of F3D-1: 
In late 1945, the US Navy was in search of a new carrier-based fighter that was to be jet-powered and able to fly in all weather. The two-seated, twin-engine fighter was to be equipped with a radar and with specifications for a top speed of 500 mph (805 km/h), an operating altitude of 40,000 ft (12,192 m),[1] and able to detect an enemy 125 miles (201 km) away.[2] The Douglas Aircraft Company were among the many companies that were asked to produce an aircraft able to meet these specifications. Led by designer Ed Heineman, Douglas produced the designs that the US Navy thought suited best and were offered a contract for three prototypes under the designation XF3D-1, with the nickname Skyknight, on 03 April 1946.[2]
