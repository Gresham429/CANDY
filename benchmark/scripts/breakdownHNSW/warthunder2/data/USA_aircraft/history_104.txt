History of P-51D-20-NA: 
Early in the war, the British ordered P-40 Warhawks from North American Aviation. North American promised to provide better aircraft designs to them sometime after the deliveries were complete. The prototype XP-51 was then developed. It had the same Allison V-1710 engine as the P-40 but was faster due to its laminar flow wing design. The XP-51 Mustang also had increased range and speed.
