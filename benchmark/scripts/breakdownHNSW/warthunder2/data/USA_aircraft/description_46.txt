Description of B-34: 
The Lockheed Ventura was a military version of the Model 18 Lodestar passenger aircraft. L-108, as it would be temporarily named, was developed as a successor to the Lockheed Hudson, which saw massive use in the Royal Air Force. The Ventura was intended to be a slightly larger, more powerful aircraft compared to the Hudson. At this time, the B-34 designation was not given. The RAF became the primary user of the Ventura until the Ventura IIA which was given the designation "B-34". It was delivered under the Lend-Lease Act, and thus were given both RAF and US serial numbers. Soon after, they were put into service by the United States Army Air Force and received the name "Lexington". B-34s were largely relegated to training, and most never saw active combat in US service. In fact, they were given the designation "RB-34", which states that it was not allowed to be used in combat.
