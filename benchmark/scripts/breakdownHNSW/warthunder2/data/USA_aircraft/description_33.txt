Description of P-40F-10: 
The Allison engine found in many P-40 variants severely limited the Warhawks' capabilities. It lacked a supercharger gear for high-altitude performance and was overall lacklustre compared to other engines. To remedy that, a P-40D was fitted with a Merlin engine in 1941. It produced around 1,300 hp and would later lead to the P-40F. The P-40F was largely the same as the previous variant but the Packard-built Merlin engine immensely increased the Warhawk's capability. It was better suited at high altitudes, the range was far better, and overall performance was increased. Over 1,300 P-40Fs were built and some were exported to the Royal Air Force.
