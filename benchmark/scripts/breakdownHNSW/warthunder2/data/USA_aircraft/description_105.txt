Description of XA-38: 
In 1942, the U.S. Army was looking for a suitable aircraft to replace the Douglas A-20 Havoc. Beech Aircraft Corporation would be given a contract to build two Model 28 "Destroyer" prototypes. Later given the designation XA-38 "Grizzly", it was originally intended to be a bomber hunter until the Army wanted a capable ground-attack aircraft. To attack well-armoured targets like bunkers and tanks, the Grizzly was fitted with a 75 mm cannon mounted directly into the nose. The Grizzly was also given two twin .50 cal turrets, one mounted on the top and one mounted in the belly to provide defensive fire. Although the Grizzly was favourable in test flights, it unfortunately fizzled out as the Wright R-3350 engines were needed for the B-29 program.
