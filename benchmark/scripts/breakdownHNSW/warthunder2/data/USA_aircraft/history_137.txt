History of F-86F-35: 
The F-86 Sabre was designed by North American Aviation Company in the mid-late 1940s as an air superiority fighter, entering service in 1949 with the USAF. In 1950, it was deployed to Korea to combat the communist MiG-15s, and went on to score 560 kills to only 78 losses against the MiGs. Post-Korea, it went on to serve many other nations such as Pakistan, Taiwan, and Bolivia, the latter nation retiring its Sabres in 1994. Over 9,000 Sabres were built, including versions built in Canada and Australia, making the F-86 the most-produced Western fighter jet in military history.
