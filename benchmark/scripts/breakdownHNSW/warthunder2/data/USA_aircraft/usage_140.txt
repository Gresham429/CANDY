Usage of F-86F-2: 
The plane's biggest strength and its specialty are the four 20 mm T-160 revolver cannons it carries. If you weren't a fan of Sabres due to its Browning machine guns, know that these guns completely change the feel of the plane. That is because these guns are arguably the best aircraft cannon found at 9.0, boasting extremely high velocity, great damage and great fire rate. On top of that, the Sabre's airframe makes aiming and leading these excellent guns very easy. None of the F-2 Sabre's contemporaries can boast such a powerful and easy to utilize gun platform. What this means is that the F-2 Sabre is an excellent plane for punishing other players' mistakes, no matter how small, as just one very quick burst from these guns will devastate most aircraft.
