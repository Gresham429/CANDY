Description of B-10B: 
The B-10B was the first bomber with an all-metal monoplane airframe, closed cockpit, and rotating gun turrets. It was also the first mass-produced bomber that was faster than contemporary fighter aircraft. The B-10 had its first flight on 16th February 1932 and caused a revolution in bomber design, where all future designs featured elements of the B-10 such as retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, and full engine cowling. Production ended after 348 B-10s and its variants were made in 1940. The US Air force ordered 103 aircraft in 1935, all delivered by 1936. After that, export of the B-10 was permitted. Operator countries included 37 aircraft serving in Argentinian Navy and Army Aviation Service, 9 were delivered to Chinese Nationalist Air Force in 1937, Thailand received 6 aircraft which they used in the war with France during 1940, Turkey with 20 aircraft and Netherlands with 9.
