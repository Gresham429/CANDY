Usage of B-17E: 
The B-17E Flying Fortress is intended to be used as a high-altitude level bomber in order to target airfields, bases, and land fortifications. Despite its large bomb load, it's not recommended to target moving ground units, such as tanks or armoured cars, especially when they are travelling in tight columns due to the inaccuracy of your bombs at high altitudes and the ability for the AI on the ground to perform evasive manoeuvres when bombs are falling onto their position. When using the B-17E, it is best to fly with another friendly bomber or fighter (if possible) to ensure maximum protection. If you are flying alone, side climb then fly along the edge of the map to the enemy base. NEVER fly directly toward the enemy base; interceptors will trace your path and shoot you down.
