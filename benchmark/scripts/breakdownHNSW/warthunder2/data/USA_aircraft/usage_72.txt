Usage of PBJ-1J: 
The PBJ-1J is the U.S. Navy version of the B-25J-1 Mitchell, however, these aircraft were assigned to U.S. Marine Corps marine bomber squadrons (VMB) as land-based bombers or ground attackers. This aircraft is virtually identical to its cousin, the PBJ-1H Mitchell, which is also just ground attack variant of the U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber. The only notable difference between the 1H and 1J model aircraft is that the 1J removes the 75 mm cannon and replaces it with an additional 4 x 12.7 mm Browning machine guns in the nose. Otherwise the same strategy and tactic for the 1H apply to the 1J. Fly almost at treetop levels in order to demotivate high altitude fighters from diving on you, and attack enemy ground targets. Ensure to use ground targets belts in order to maximize the effectiveness against light and medium tanks. Keep in mind that medium tanks will require precise aiming at the rear armour or roof from optimal angles in order to be effective. Reserve bombs for targets the PBJ-1J's machine guns under any circumstance cannot deal with (like heavy tanks and pillboxes, this is especially critical in Realistic and simulator battles as it is necessary to land on an airfield in order to retrieve new bombs).
