Description of F-16A: 
The first production version of the Fighting Falcon was the F-16A/B variants, with the F-16A being the single-seat version and the F-16B featuring two seats. The F-16 Block 10 retained the F100-PW-200 engine featured in the Block 1 and 5 versions of the F-16. However, the Block 10 was largely unchanged compared to the earlier versions but did involve the colour of the radome changing. Earlier versions had a black radome and in mock dogfights, pilots noticed how easy it was to spot an F-16 due to the colour. The Block 10 radome was changed to gray and the Block 1 and 5 were upgraded to Block 10 standards. Over 150 Block 10s were produced and some were later modified for ground attack.
