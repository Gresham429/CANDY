Description of A-7D: 
In the early 1960s, the US Navy needed a new naval strike aircraft to replace the A-4 Skyhawk. Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) developed the A-7 based on the F-8 Crusader, but smaller and subsonic to reduce costs. The A-7 won the competition and was named A-7 'Corsair II' in homage to the F4U Corsair. The A-7A started production in 1966 and saw action in Vietnam.  The USAF developed the A-7D in 1968 with improved avionics, a stronger engine, and an M61 Vulcan cannon. Over 450 A-7D units were produced from 1968 to 1975. The A-7D served until the early 1990s before retirement. The A-7D included a new M61A1 rotatory gun instead of the regular 20mm cannons of the A-7, a new TF-41 engine and a different central computer.
