Description of P-47D-22-RE: 
The P-47D-22-REÂ Thunderbolt was one of the last variants in the P-47D family to have a razorback airframe. The D-22-RE and D-23-RA were essentially the same aircraft and both utilized the all-important water injection system. The D-22 received an impressive 3.9 metre (13 foot) propeller which had only 15 cm (6 in) clearance from the ground. The new propeller also increased the climb rate significantly. The D-22 also has the Pratt & Whitney R-2800-63, essentially the R-2800-21 but with water injection installed at the factory. It differs from the -59 in having a less efficient ignition system. The main difference between the D-22-RE and D-23-RA was the specific propeller used. D-22-REs had the Hamilton Standard Hydromatic 24E50-65 propeller whereas the D-23-RA had a Curtiss Electric propeller.
