History of F6F-5: 
The F6F Hellcat was Grumman's next fighter after the successful Wildcat. The F6F was designed from the start to be the ultimate answer against the Japanese Zero. The Hellcat was the planned replacement to the Wildcat since Pearl Harbor. The aircraft was designed from the start to be a much bigger airframe. The plan was to create a carrier-based fighter with more ammo, fuel, and larger wings. The XF6F-1 Prototype was already in the works when the U.S. officially entered World War II. Grumman engineers knew they would have to create an aircraft that was faster and climbed better based on combat experience and data collected from the A6M captured in the Aleutians. The prototype flew in June of 1942 and was powered by a Wright Cyclone R-2600. The aircraft's performance was not satisfactory. The decision was made to replace the powerplant with the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp.
