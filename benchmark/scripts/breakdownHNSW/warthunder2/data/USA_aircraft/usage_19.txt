Usage of PBM-1_%22Mariner%22: 
The PBM-1 should be played like its predecessors. Fly high and bomb bases. The PBM is however fairly slow and has a rather bad climb rate, so it will take time. The PBM can carry up to 4 x 1,000 lb bombs. It is advisable to carry this bombload for bombing bases. Even though you are slow, you are not defenseless. Your .50s will shred everything at your BR. Once your bombs are dropped it is advisable to land, but acting as a "gunship" can also be somewhat successful.
