Usage of P-47N-15: 
How to offensively engage an enemy aircraft - From the start of the match you want to be gaining altitude. Side climbing is heavily recommended, as many planes at the P-47's BR climb much faster vertically. Once at a high enough altitude, the P-47's greatest strength is its speed. It has great acceleration and great speed at most altitudes. From there your main operation of attack will be the simple Boom & Zoom tactic, making good use of its amazing energy retention. However it isn't strictly limited to this role. The P-47N has very strong elevator and rudder authority. While it is not the most recommended tactic, if you are at a higher speed you can dogfight most planes for short periods of time, so long as you make use of vertical space as well as horizontal while you do it and watch your speed. Engaging in turn fighting is not recommended because most enemies you will be facing can out-turn you easily.
