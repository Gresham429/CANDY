Description of PBM-1_%22Mariner%22: 
Glenn L. Martin Company was one of the few companies in America that was heavily into designing and producing seaplanes. One of the many seaplanes they built was the twin-engine PBM Mariner intended to be the successor of the P3M. The PBM-1 would feature two Wright R-2600-6 engines each producing 1,600 hp as well as a gull wing type design and twin tail. They entered service in 1940 and were utilized in regular patrols as well as anti-submarine warfare. Ten U-boats were sunk by PBM Mariners including U-158 which was sunk near the Bermudas. Mariners in American service were used until the last squadron (VP-50) retired the aircraft in 1956.
