History of F-14B: 
During the mid-1980s, the United States Navy (USN) made a momentous decision to enhance the F-14 airframe by introducing a remarkable new variant of the aircraft. Originally designated as the F-14A+, this exceptional aircraft would eventually earn the prestigious moniker of the F-14B. The USN's comprehensive modernization program aimed to bring the F-14 airframe up to date with the latest technological advancements. One of the key aspects of this program was the incorporation of numerous electronic upgrades. The F-14B underwent a significant avionics overhaul, introducing advanced systems that improved the aircraft's capabilities in various areas. These upgrades included enhanced RWR systems, improved target detection and tracking capabilities (introduction of the Television Camera System) and upgraded communication systems to ensure seamless integration with other elements of the modern battlefield. In addition to these upgrades, the F-14B also received a major boost in terms of its powerplant. The outdated engines of the original F-14A model were replaced with the more advanced F110-GE-400 engines. These engines provided increased thrust and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in enhanced performance and greater operational flexibility for the aircraft. The F-110 engines also offered improved reliability and reduced maintenance requirements, which were crucial factors in ensuring the overall effectiveness and availability of the F-14B.
