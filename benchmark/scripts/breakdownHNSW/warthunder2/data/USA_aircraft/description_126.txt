Description of F2H-2: 
The Banshee first started life as the XFD-1 Phantom (not to be confused with the F-4 Phantom II) in the very late stages of World War 2. It was intended to be used during the planned invasion of Japan in 1946. A decent number of Phantoms were built, but they were quickly out of service when the far improved XF2D-1 Banshee was designed. It was more powerful and had more range thanks to its better engines and larger airframe. The F2H-2 Banshee was the second production variant of the Banshee. It had provisions for more fuel tanks and better engines than the F2H-1. The Westinghouse J34-WE-34 engine provided an 8% increase in thrust and allowed for more pylons to be added to the airframe. This would also be the most produced variant, with over 300 being built.
