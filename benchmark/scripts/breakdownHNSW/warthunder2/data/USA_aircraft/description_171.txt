Description of F-15A: 
Towards the end of the Vietnam War, the United States saw their major shortcoming in dogfighting performance, as the heavy F-4 Phantom operated by most branches at the time was garnering an unsatisfactory kill-death ratio. Meanwhile, the far more manoeuvrable "gunfighter" F-8 Crusader II was achieving a far better track record. As a result, not long after the end of the conflict, two new development projects were started by the USAF, one of which was the F-X program to develop a "next generation" fighter that favoured manoeuvrability over top speed. However, the F-X program would take a sharp turn not long after, as multiple radar reports from Turkey and Israel observed an unknown Soviet aircraft flying overhead at speeds above Mach 3. Quick investigation through spy satellites and high altitude reconnaissance aircraft brought the discovery of the Soviet's latest MiG-25 aircraft, which at the time was assumed by the West as a high tech, next generation fighter made of the latest composite materials. What scared the United States the most, was that the design of this MiG-25 was dangerously similar to the initial prototypes of the F-X program, which had not even flown yet. Eventually, development of the F-X program was accelerated into its latter phases, resulting in the venerable F-15 Eagle, an absolute best of all worlds, no compromises held, air superiority fighter to combat this new Soviet threat. However, the defection of Viktor Belenko to Japan with his MiG-25 shortly after showed the world that the MiG-25 was overestimated, being in reality constructed out of heavy metals and armed with weaker avionics suited for long range combat, making the MiG-25 merely a heavy interceptor, and not the "next generation super-fighter" that was feared before. The same cannot be said about the indomitable Eagle however, as the F-15 and its later variants would go on to establish the most widely regarded air-to-air combat kill-death ratio of any modern jet fighter: at least 103 aircraft kills without a single confirmed loss.
