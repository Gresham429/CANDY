Usage of F3H-2: 
Unfortunately for the F3H-2, its BR means that almost every battle will be an uphill battle: nearly every aircraft at this BR has either superior armament (better/more AA missiles, better/more cannons), or vastly superior performance (nearly all being supersonic, and the majority of non-supersonic aircraft being highly manoeuvrable VTOL jets), or radar warning receivers that nullify any surprise to using the Sparrow missiles, or most significantly, countermeasures. Quite often, opponents will have four of those advantages at once, meaning that F3H-2 pilots will have to resort to catching enemies off guard (a rarity due to the prevalence of radar and RWR systems at this BR) or get lucky in the classic head-on with your cannons. You can attempt to play as a CAS aircraft and hope you aren't shot down, but this can yield varying results due to its mediocre ground armament. If you choose to not outright purchase the AIM-7s with Golden Eagles, this should be the modification you focus on obtaining the moment you acquire the aircraft. In the event you find yourself on the defensive in a dogfight, the most you can do is slow down and constantly manoeuvre on the deck, hoping to get them in front of you and to help defeat AAMs. Note that this strategy is almost always suicide against VTOL aircraft like the Yak-38 or Harrier variants (as they will easily out manoevre you if they haven't already fired their AAMs).
