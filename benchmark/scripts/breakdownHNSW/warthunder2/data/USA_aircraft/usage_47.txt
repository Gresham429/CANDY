Usage of B-25J-1: 
In Realistic battles (and Arcade to an extent), it is highly recommended against exclusively bombing strategic bases and in general to not bomb from high altitudes. It was rarely used this way in combat, and it makes it very easy for enemy fighters to approach and attack you from your defenceless belly. Also, the bomber's maximum payload of 3 x 1,000 lb of bombs is not enough to destroy an enemy base in Realistic battles, which is useless in regards to decreasing ticket count and, most importantly, does not help your team. Thus, leave base bombing to the British heavy bombers you will likely also encounter on your team, whose payloads vastly outclass yours, and instead - if you wish to help your team as much as possible - use your five nose-mounted Browning machine guns on ground targets. Ground target strafing is not only infinitely more exciting than base bombing, but it can also lower the enemy's ticket count drastically, therefore helping your team win. Fly at low altitudes and attack light pillboxes and soft targets with your guns. If you fail to destroy a target, then pitch up and use your turrets to finish it off. Save the bombs for targets the .50 cal guns cannot destroy, such as heavy tanks and heavy pillboxes; the bombsight is very helpful in doing this (something which the dedicated strafing variants such as the PBJ-1J lack). Make sure to use a fuse timer, 3 seconds should be enough when bombing at treetop level with 1,000 lb bombs.
