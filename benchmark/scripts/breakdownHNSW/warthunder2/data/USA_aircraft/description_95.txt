Description of A-26B-10: 
To capitalize on the export success of the A-20 Havoc, the Douglas Aircraft Company has developed a successor attack aircraft design immediately after the Havoc has entered service with the USAAC in 1941. What would become the A-26 Invader was designed as a mutirole light bomber and ground attack aircraft, with a distinctive features of interchangeable nose section that can either be equipped with a glass canopy for the bombardier position when used as a bomber (designated A-26C) or a forward-facing guns of various calibres to attack ground targets (designated A-26B). After entered service in 1944, the Invader would went on to have a long and decorated career life up until the Vietnam War era thanks to its versatility. At one point, it was even redesignated as "B-26" when the unrelated B-26 Marauder was retied in 1946, which would results into a confusion between two aircrafts.
