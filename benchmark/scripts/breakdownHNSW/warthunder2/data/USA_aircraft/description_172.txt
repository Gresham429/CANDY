Description of F-14A_Early: 
One of the most iconic US naval fighter jets of the Cold War era, the two-seater F-14A was developed as the US Navy's fleet-defense fighter jet to protect their carrier groups over vast swathes of ocean against Soviet bombers carrying anti-ship missiles. Developed after the US Navy's failed F-111B program, the F-14A was first deployed in 1974 wielding the advanced AN/AWG-9 radar and up to eight missiles, including the iconic Phoenix missile, to target and destroy enemy targets from extremely long ranges. Although it introduced a host of new capabilities, the F-14A suffered from its TF30 engines, which were subject to frequent failures, and other issues with the aircraft's flight characteristics that caused regular accidents.
