History of F2A-3: 
The F2A-3 Buffalo was an interwar to early-WWII fighter aircraft of the United States Navy. Designed for the Navy's use on aircraft carriers, the F2A Buffalo was the first American monoplane naval fighter to enter service, beating the biplane XF4F design (which would later be redeveloped into the monoplane F4F Wildcat). The F2A served during the early days of WWII with the US navy, where it proved to be an ineffective fighter. The aircraft would be retired partway through the war with the development of more advanced aircraft.
