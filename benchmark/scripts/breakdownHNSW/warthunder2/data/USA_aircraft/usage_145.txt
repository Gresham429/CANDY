Usage of FJ-4B: 
In battle, you are a support aircraft or a ground attack aircraft. When being a support aircraft, your job is to bait the enemy into getting low and slow, which makes it easier for your allies to come and clean up the enemy. Since you don't retain energy very well and you have poor acceleration, try to always manoeuvre with the enemy and if possible, shoot down enemy aircraft. When using it as a ground attack aircraft you have many options. The recommended loadout is either is 114 FFAR Mighty Mouse Rockets, or the 76 FFAR Mighty Mouse Rockets and two AIM-9B sidewinders. It is recommended that you attack primary ground targets like pillboxes and artillery positions. It is not recommended to carry bombs on this aircraft as you do not have the bomb load to take out an enemy base. Try to fly as low as possible to avoid being detected by the enemy. If attacked by enemy aircraft, turn into your opponent as this will not give them a firing solution. In Ground RB, you are one of the most heavily armed ground attackers for its tier, although in this game mode enemy tanks will require more than one rocket in order to be knocked out.
