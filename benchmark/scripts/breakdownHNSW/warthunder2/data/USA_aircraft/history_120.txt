History of F-80A-5: 
The F-80 Shooting Star was the product of a design project started in mid-1943. At the time, Lockheed had been asked to produce an aircraft using the de Havilland Halford jet engine, capable of fighting the Me 262 Schwalbe on more-than-equal terms. As a result, a production prototype (see photo) was developed in just 143 days. This was a huge feat, as the aircraft was a full-scale prototype with functional armament. The aircraft was produced in a large tent in complete secrecy, while the team responsible for its production would become the predecessor to Lockheed's famous 'Skunk Works'[1].
