Usage of F-16A: 
The F-16A can be a powerful fighter with multiple playstyles, one option being to simply rush straight into battle. Players who plan to stay low and accelerate straight into action will be satisfied with the F-16's low-altitude performance and radar. A mixed countermeasure loadout (1 flare, 1 chaff) is recommended because it allows 30 countermeasure drops against radar or IR missiles. To be prepared for matches that may extend longer than usual, select the 30-minute fuel option in conjunction with the 300-gallon drop tank, or the full tank of 41 minutes. The F-16 consumes a lot of fuel on afterburner, so it's essential to use it wisely unless the max fuel amount is selected. If low fuel maneuverability is desirable, bringing 20 minutes on smaller maps and 30 minutes on larger maps is viable, but this requires management of fuel (i.e.  "halfterburner" or using the scroll wheel to partially engage afterburner).
