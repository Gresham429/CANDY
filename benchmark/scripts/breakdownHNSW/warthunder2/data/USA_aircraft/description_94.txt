Description of F7F-1: 
By around 1938, the U.S. Navy had started investigating the possibilities of a twin-engine carrier-borne fighter. Quickly thereafter the XF5F Skyrocket was designed. The compact aircraft was to include a 23 mm Madsen cannon, two .50 calibre machine guns, and two .30 calibre machine guns. The Skyrocket test results were not very satisfactory and in 1941 the U.S. Navy moved onto to a new aircraft. The XF7F-1 Tigercat prototype made its original flight on December 2, 1943. The F7F-1 aircraft went into production in April of 1944, but the Midway-class carriers had not yet been completed, so the first Tigercats were given to the U.S. Marine Corp. Only 35 of these aircraft were built until production switched to the two-seat night fighter variant. These were built in limited numbers as well.
