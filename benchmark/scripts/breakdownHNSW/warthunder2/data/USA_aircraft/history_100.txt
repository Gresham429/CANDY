History of B-17G-60-VE: 
Due to direct experience from U.S. bomber crews in 1943, the B-17F revealed inadequate protection from head-on attacks by enemy fighters. To remedy this problem, a remote-controlled chin turret armed with two 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns was introduced on the final production block of Douglas-built B-17Fs, the B-17F-75-DL. This turret became standard on the B-17G, and proved to be more practical than manually operated guns initially fitted to the nose. The B-17G began delivery in September of 1943 and included various upgrades throughout its production. A total of 8,680 aircraft were built from three manufacturers until April of 1945. The B-17G could be considered the cornerstone of U.S. bombing efforts in the European theatre between 1944 and 1945.
