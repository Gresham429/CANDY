History of A-4B: 
At a time when military aircraft were becoming more substantial in size to hold larger engines, more weapons, essential fuel and new technology, Douglas Aircraft's concept of the A-4 Skyhawk seemed counter-intuitive. The A-1 Skyraider, while a potent aircraft was starting to age out of the service as faster jets began to supplant the propeller-driven attacker. In the early 1950s, the U.S. Navy began its search for the next generation attacker and put out a requirement for an attacker with a maximum cost of $1 million and a maximum empty weight of 20,000 lbs (9,071 kg) and could carry enough ammunition to at least compete with the older but beefy A-1.
