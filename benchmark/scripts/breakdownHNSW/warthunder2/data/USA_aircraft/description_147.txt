Description of A-4E_Early: 
The A-4E, also known as the A4D-5, was a significantly improved version within the Skyhawk family. It had the J52-P-6A engine which produced almost 3,500 kgf of thrust. Most importantly, the P-6A had far better fuel efficiency which increased the range but did require parts of the airframe to be changed. The A-4E received improvements in computers such as the AJB-3A and Mk 9 bombing systems. A-4Es were later fitted with the improved J-52-P-8 and had the iconic hump behind the cockpit which housed more avionics.
