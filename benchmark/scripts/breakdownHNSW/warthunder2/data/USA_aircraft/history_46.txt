History of B-34: 
In the beginning of the war, the British were looking for a medium-ranged anti-submarine warfare and patrol aircraft to support the existing Avro Anson. The Lockheed company sent a drawing of their Model 14 Super Electra civilian airliner. The British Purchasing Commission saw the design and asked Lockheed to make modifications to the Model 14. Modifications included two fixed forward-firing Browning 7.7 mm machine guns in the nose. There was also the installation of a Boulton Paul dorsal gun turret with two Browning machine guns. Some models had beam guns installed, while others had different engines or propellers. It was renamed the Lockheed Hudson. The Hudson served as the basis for the B-34 (Ventura, originally). It was developed from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, another civilian airliner. The Ventura was first delivered to the British in 1942. Originally, it was used for daylight raids but, like other RAF bombers of the time, were vulnerable without fighter escort. It was transferred to Coastal Command. In US service, it was named the B-34 Lexington. There was also a reconnaissance variant called the B-37 (and later the RB-37, the "R" standing for "restricted," as in not for combat). Later on, a redesigned version, the PV-2 Harpoon, was put into service. The wingspan was increased, among other changes.
