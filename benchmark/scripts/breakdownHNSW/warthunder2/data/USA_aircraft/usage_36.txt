Usage of F4F-3: 
The Wildcat is an easy plane to fly. It is very manoeuvrable and well-armed for its class. You can out turn pretty much all German and Soviet aircraft, but beware that you don't get into a turnfight with any of the Japanese planes and especially the British Spitfires. The Wildcat will lose a large amount of energy during a dogfight making it sluggish, and therefore an easy target for enemy planes with good energy retention, like the Yak-1.
