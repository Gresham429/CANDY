History of F7F-3: 
The Grumman company continued to work on the F7F after it entered service. The third variant of the aircraft was a very deep modernization of the original, although visually the only difference was a bigger tail section (this resulted in a much better stability during flight). On the other hand, the biggest change was the introduction of the more powerful "Pratt & Whitney" R-2800-34W engines with a power output of 2,100 HP, which allowed for better flight characteristics in the Tigercat at high altitude.
