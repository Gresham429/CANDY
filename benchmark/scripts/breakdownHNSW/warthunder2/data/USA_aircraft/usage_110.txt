Usage of A-1H: 
The A-1H can perform well in battles at its BR, either in a CAS role with 30 x 250 lb bomb capacity, 228 x FFAR rockets and 11 x Mk 77 mod 2 incendiary bombs. Once the ordnance is expended, it can also perform decently as a fighter since it has flares, which allows for it to be used in higher tier battles.
