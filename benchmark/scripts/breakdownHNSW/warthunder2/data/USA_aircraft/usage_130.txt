Usage of F3D-1: 
The F3D-1 is pretty good in a dogfight with the right energy situation. While it may not be able to out-turn every enemy it faces, it has decent enough maneuverability to face the majority of the planes it faces. The plane does suffer from a relatively poor climb rate and below average top speed, but once it gains the altitude it needs to gain speed, it can be quite a fighting plane.
