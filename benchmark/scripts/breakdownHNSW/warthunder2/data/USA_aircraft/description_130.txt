Description of F3D-1: 
During 1945, the Navy was discussing the idea of a jet-powered aircraft that could operate from carriers. In addition, it was required to have radar and fly in night conditions. Out of 4 companies, Douglas' proposal would ultimately earn the Navy's full attention and they were awarded contracts to build 3 prototypes. Soon after, the name Skyknight was chosen for the project. In 1948, the XF3D-1 was ready for its first flight. It was to be powered by two J34-WE-22 engines and a preliminary radar as the APQ-65 was unavailable at the time. Two XF3D-1's were built with the SCR-720 radar until the third prototype which received the planned APQ-65. After test flights showed the Skyknight to be a capable aircraft, 28 F3D-1s were ordered for both the USMC and USN. The production F3D-1 received a few changes such as better engines (J-34-WE-34) and gained around 5,000 lbs (2,267 kg) in weight.
