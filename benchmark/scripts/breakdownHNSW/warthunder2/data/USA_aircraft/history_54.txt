History of P-40C: 
The P-40C Warhawk, known as the Tomahawk IIB in British service, was an improvement of the P-40B. The P-40C added provisions for underbelly fuel drop tanks and bomb shackles, added self-sealing fuel tanks, and also featured numerous minor improvements. All of these changes increased the weight of the aircraft, which had already suffered from a low power-to-weight ratio.
