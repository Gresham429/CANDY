Description of SB2U-2: 
The SB2U was developed in the early 1930s and although considered obsolete at the outbreak of World War II, it still remained in service through the Battle of Midway. However, in 1943, it was withdrawn into training units and replaced by more advanced aircraft. This aircraft featured a constant-speed propeller which was intended to be utilized as a dive brake while performing dive-bombing attack manoeuvres. There are three hard points for bombs to be attached, one 250 lb bomb under each wing and a single 500 or 1,000 lb bomb mounted onto a pylon under the fuselage. The larger bomb was also attached to what was called a "trapeze", a device which would when the bomb was released, swing the bomb clear of the propeller arc.
