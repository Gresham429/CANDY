Usage of A-7K: 
In Air RB, the A-7K presents a very limited utility, mainly attacking ground targets. Bases are an option, but its low top speed combined with the limited manoeuvrability while carrying ordinance make it a perilous mission, as you are an easy target for any fighter that can show up, and friendly planes will almost always get there before you do. Flying to the side low to the ground is recommended, until enemy aircraft will back out or start fighting with your team. Then you can target respawning bases behind the frontline, and once you are done, if you didn't get a chance to do so, you can try to use your missiles to take down enemies, but keep in mind you don't want to start actively fighting. If a fighter decides to target you, strongly consider dropping your ordinance and abandoning any bombing run to increase your chances of survival. The strongest enemies you can encounter are the MiG-29, F-16 and F-14. There is nothing the A-7K can realistically do to counter those aircraft, so you want to stay unseen as long as it is possible, though the AIM-9L can occasionally get rid of an unsuspecting target.
