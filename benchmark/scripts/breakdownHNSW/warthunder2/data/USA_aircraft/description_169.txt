Description of F-16A_ADF: 
After the USAF Air Defense Command was dissolved, the Air National Guard (ANG) took up the task of defending American airspace in the mid-1980s. The F-16, which was introduced only several years prior, was selected, and 270 F-16A/B airframes were converted to the ADF (Air Defense Fighter) standard. The first production variants of the F-16 could not utilize the AIM-7 Sparrow, so the ADF included that feature. It also featured the AN/APX-109 IFF system and a spotlight for illumination during nighttime operations. Conversions were conducted at Ogden Air Logistics Center and carried on for 3 years. After the threat of Soviet bombers was over, many of the F-16 ADFs were either reconverted back into F-16A/Bs, placed into storage or sold off to other countries.
