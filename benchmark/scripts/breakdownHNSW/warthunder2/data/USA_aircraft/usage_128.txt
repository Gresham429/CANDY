Usage of F9F-5: 
The baseline Panther has very poor performance, losing a lot of speed in turns and having poor acceleration. Once the aircraft has been upgraded, it is a very powerful fighter. Its decent climb rate and 20mm guns make the aircraft best for Boom and Zoom tactics. The aircraft has poor top speed, making it vulnerable to enemy F-86s and MiGs flying at higher altitudes.
