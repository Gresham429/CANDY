Usage of F-5C: 
In air RB, the F-5C can be played as both a support and offensive plane. In medium range engagements, it plays well as a support fighter, either baiting enemies to use up missiles with the large amount of flares/chaff or launching missiles at enemies who are chasing friendly aircraft to give a chance to let your teammate get in a better position. In close range engagements, with some effort you can stay on the tail of the enemy, if possible making the enemy pull as many manoeuvres as possible to slow them down so you can get a short burst from the respectable 20 mm cannons mounted in the nose. Due to the plane's characteristics, overshooting an enemy won't be the end of a dogfight, the F-5C is able bleed enough speed in a quick turn to get right back on the enemy if they don't take advantage of the overshoot or if they are going too slow to be able to make any quick counterattack. Being slow and at a disadvantage, which is bad for any other jet at this tier, is especially terrible for this plane. The weak engines compared to its adversaries and the wing shape combine to give you great AoA but poor energy retention. At speeds above Mach 0.9, this is not an issue, but any lower than 850 km/h you will start to lose speed rapidly in a sharp turn. It is therefore recommended to pick 1v1 fights against weaker aircraft or enlist the help of teammates to take down the enemy. Another useful tip when grinding with the F-5C is to take an 2000 lb bomb and 2 BLU-1 incendiary bombs to drop on one base before turning around and going back for air targets on the way back to the base.
