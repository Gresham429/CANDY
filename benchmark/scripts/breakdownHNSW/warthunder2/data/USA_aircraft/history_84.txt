History of PV-2D: 
After the success of the Lockheed Hudson, Lockheed sought to introduce another bomber named the Ventura based off their Model 18 Lodestar transport aircraft. Though similar to the Hudson, the Ventura was a lot bigger. The Royal Air Force adopted the plane under the Ventura name, and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) adopted it as the B-34 Lexington. Though the Ventura was faster and could hold twice as many bombs than the Hudson, the Royal Air Force did not like the plane very much and replaced them with Mosquitoes, the surplus Venturas sent to Coastal Command. America's usage of the B-34 Lexington was complicated with a feud in air power between the USAAF and the US Navy (USN). The USAAF had a monopoly on manufacturing and command of land-based bombers, leading to naval activities such as anti-submarine duties with bombers shouldered by the USAAF rather than the USN, forcing the usage of float planes like the Catalina in the Navy's role. It wasn't until a compromise with the B-29 Superfortress in a naval manufacturing factory that the Army finally gave the Navy the aircraft and jurisdiction to act in their roles.
