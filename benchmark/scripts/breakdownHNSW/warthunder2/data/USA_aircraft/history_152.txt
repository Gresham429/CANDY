History of F11F-1: 
The F11F Tiger was a carrier-based fighter aircraft used by the US Navy between 1955 and 1968. The aircraft was originally designed as an advanced derivative of the F9F Panther, but soon became a completely new design. The aircraft has the distinction of being the second supersonic navy aircraft, after the F4D Skyray. F11F aircraft served in operational units between 1957 and 1961, while trainer variants served into the early 1970s. The aircraft also enjoyed a long service life with the Blue Angels demonstration team, which used the aircraft from 1957 to 1968 when it was superseded by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.
