Description of F-14B: 
Even before the F-14 had its first test flight, Grumman knew the F-14A's performance would be underwhelming due to its TF-30 engines. This, as well as the VAX-2 specification sent out by the US Navy during the 1980s, led to the F-14B. The F-14B was a huge improvement over the F-14A in almost every aspect. New avionics, systems, engines, and much more were done on the F-14B. One of the upgrades included the addition of the AN/AXX-1 Television Camera System (TCS), for IFF purposes. The F-14B's main upgrade were the engines: General Electric F110-GE-400s replaced the TF-30s and massively improved the performance in essentially every aspect. The range, top speed, and turn rate were significantly improved, which meant the F-14B was far more suitable for carrier operations than the F-14A.
