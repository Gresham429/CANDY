Usage of XP-38G: 
Utilize the P-38 as a strike fighter. The P-38 has very good energy retention and climb speed, so mainly use it as a BnZ fighter. However, it can be an effective turn fighter against less manoeuvrable opponents. Be warned, however, that once at a low speed and altitude the P-38 is a sitting duck. It is a very large fighter and easy to destroy.
