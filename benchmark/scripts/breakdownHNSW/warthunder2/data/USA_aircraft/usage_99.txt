Usage of AM-1: 
The AM-1 is a classic attacker, and it will come as no surprise that its manoeuvrability is lacking. It's fine at high speeds, but at low speeds, the aircraft quickly becomes sluggish, even when no payload is equipped. The plane also has poor acceleration and poor manoeuvring energy retention, all of which means that this plane struggles in a dogfight. If the pilot does find themselves in an engagement against a dedicated fighter aircraft, the best thing to do would be to fly towards a teammate who can help.
