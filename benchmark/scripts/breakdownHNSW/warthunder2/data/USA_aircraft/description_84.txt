Description of PV-2D: 
The Lockheed PV-2 "Harpoon" was a significant development from the PV-1 "Ventura". The Harpoon, much like the name implies, was intended for maritime duties. One of the biggest complaints about the PV-1 was its lacklustre takeoff performance. To fix that, the PV-2 featured a longer wingspan to increase lift. Further modifications included more provisions for fuel, the removal of the bombardier's position, and other air frame changes. The R-2800-31 Double Wasp engine was kept in place from the Ventura. Performance was expected to be a bit worse except for range and take-off due to the extra fuel provisions and wing change. During initial testing, it was found that the wings would wrinkle, and another completely new redesign was needed to fix the issue. After the problem was remedied, the PV-2 Harpoon was quite popular within service and was also exported to other countries like Brazil and New Zealand.
