Description of F4F-3: 
The Grumman F4F Wildcat was the US Navy's backbone against the Japanese A6M2 and A6M3 Zero in the early stages of the Pacific War. The aircraft was praised for its survivability and reliability, but in most cases, regular pilots could not out-dogfight the skilled Japanese pilots in their Zero fighters. The F4F-3 was a single-engine all-metal plane with midwing construction, armed with four 12.7 mm M-2 Browning machine guns. Because of its lack of manoeuvrability, the F4F-3 lost to the Japanese fighter in close dogfights, so pilots prefer to avoid such situations by diving out of battle, taking advantage of their aircraft's higher speed. It was also used by Britain under the name Martlet II and Martlet III.
