Usage of PV-2D: 
The PV-2D Harpoon is a bomber and should be played as such. Its gigantic and versatile payload options allow for enough power against ground/naval targets and bases. The eight nose-mounted 12.7 mm machine guns deal excellent damage, and can be used offensively with the dorsal turret able to point forward. Though the gunners provide ample top and bottom protection, the tail of the vehicle is a blind spot to the two turret gunners and thus a tailing pursuant would be a priority threat.
