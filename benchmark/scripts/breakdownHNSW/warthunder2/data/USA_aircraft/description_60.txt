Description of P-63C-5: 
After the Merlin-powered P-63B failed to come to fruition, production moved to the P-63C. It was powered by an improved Allison engine that came equipped with water injection which could boost power up to an impressive 1,800 hp. The wingspan was also shortened but was otherwise largely the same as the P-63A. The C-5 in particular had a ventral fin to help with stability and had more armour. Over 1,000 P-63Cs were produced and delivered well into the war. Many were sent to the Soviets under the lend-lease program but around 100 were also sent to France.
