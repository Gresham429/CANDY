Usage of F-4J_Phantom_II: 
The F-4J has the best BVR capabilities of any Rank VII Phantom because of its AN/APG-59 pulse-Doppler radar and long-range AIM-7F Sparrow missiles. It pays for this by having the worst performance and dogfight capabilities of any Rank VII Phantom, not even having the reprieve of podded Vulcans and turbofan engines available to the British Phantoms. As such, it's best for the F-4J to identify and destroy targets before they get close enough to enter a dogfight.
