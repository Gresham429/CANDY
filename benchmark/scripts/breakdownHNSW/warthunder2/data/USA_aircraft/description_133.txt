Description of B-57B: 
The Martin B-57B Canberra was the second version of the license-built British English Electric Canberra jet bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Compared to the unarmed B-57A which was a complete copy of the original Canberra, the B-57B had several changes, most notably the inclusion of eight M3 Browning machine guns (and later four 20 mm M39 autocannons) as an offensive armament for strafing attack, an improved "fighter-style" cockpit that improved the pilot's visibility, a "rotary" bombing bay that improved the deployment time and accuracy of bombs, improved airbrakes, four additional hardpoints on the wings, and an addition of a radar warning receiver. These modifications proved to be a success, as it allowed the B-57B to be easily adapted into various roles, ranging from bombing to electronic warfare. In total, 202 B-57Bs were built, and served under the USAF in various roles through the Vietnam War before it was retired in 1983.
