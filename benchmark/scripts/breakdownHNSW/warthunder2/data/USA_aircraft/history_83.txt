History of BTD-1: 
The US Navy ordered two prototypes from Douglas Aircraft Company for a two seat dive bomber in June of 1941. The dive bomber was intended to replace the Douglas SBD Dauntless and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. The project was designated as the XSB2D-1. The design was a single-engine dive bomber with an inverted gull wing. It was armed with two wing-mounted 20 mm cannons, two remote-controlled turrets - each with two .50 cal machine guns - and up to 4,200 lbs of bombs in the bomb bay and on wing-mounted pylons.
