Description of P-63A-5: 
The P-63 Kingcobra was designed to improve on the shortcomings seen in the earlier P-39 Airacobra. Although the two planes seem similar, no parts on either aircraft are interchangeable, the P-63 was a new design. The first variant was the P-63A which started production in late 1942. The first deliveries began a year later, but the USAAF (US Army Air Force) rejected the Kingcobra. The Kingcobra would then find a home with the Soviet Union, which needed a competent fighter against the capable German fighters and pilots. The P-63A was virtually the same as the XP-63A but had more armour and fuel. The specific A-5 production block has a radio mast mounted on top of the fuselage and was later carried over to all variants. Not a single P-63 would ever serve in combat with the US; rather, almost every Kingcobra was sent to the Soviet Union and the few Kingcobras that did stay in the US were relegated to training use or target drones.
