Description of TBD-1: 
The Devastator had a short lifespan in the US Navy, even though it was, at the time of its introduction, one of the most advanced torpedo bombers. It saw limited use during WWII since it was considered an outdated design, with a very mediocre performance, however this failure can be attributed to the poor reliability of the U.S. Mk. 13 torpedo. A total of 129 units were purchased by the US Navy before WWII, but the Navy decided in 1940 that the Devastator needed to be quickly replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger, that was much heavier, but also had a much larger payload and was much more survivable. The Devastator was forced into active service, since the Avenger was still not ready, with 41 being deployed for the Battle of Midway and only four returning to the carriers. Most of the losses were attributed to the lack of radios and communication issues. At the end, the Devastator was an example of the technological difference between interwar and WWII developed aircraft.
