History of P-61C-1: 
P-61C is the final production version of the P-61 family with the production primarily in 1945. The most notable changes are the turbocharger fitted under each engine and the redesigned larger propeller system. With the turbocharger made by General Electric, the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine could output 2,800 hp each. Alongside the larger propeller, P-61C could perform much better at higher altitude. The 4 hardpoints under the wings for external fuel tanks and bombs from the P-61B variants were also kept, allowing the P-61C to not only perform as a night fighter, but also as a night intruder. Airbrakes were also added so P-61C would not overshoot its intended targets.
