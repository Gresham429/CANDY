Usage of B-57B: 
Unlike the B-57A model before it, the B-57B included numerous improvements and modifications to the airframe and armament that allow it to play a much more aggressive and offensive role in the battle. Able to mount up to 16 x 127 mm HVAR rockets on its external pylons in conjunction with heavy bomb loads, the B-57B is best suited to taking out armoured targets or naval targets such as destroyers and cruisers.
