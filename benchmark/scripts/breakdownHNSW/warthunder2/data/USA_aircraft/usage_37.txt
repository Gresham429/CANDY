Usage of F4F-4: 
As with any American fighter, you should break into a climb at the start of a match, attempting to reach an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 m where the Pratt and Whitney R-1830-86 radial starts increasing performance. If you encounter an enemy you know you can outturn, turn fight them and make good use of the rudder.
