Usage of P-51D-5: 
The P-51D-5 is the breakout fighter from the original P-51 design with some major changes which include the beefier Packard V-1650-7 inline engine, bubble canopy for increased pilot visibility and replacement of four 20 mm cannons for six 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine guns. While not the refined thoroughbred compared to Mustangs of later in the War, the D-5 comes into its own as a multi-purpose fighter depending on the theatre of operation and mission requirements.
