Usage of F-16C: 
The F-16C is a purebred squad fighter, performing most efficiently with allied help. A group of 3â€“4 F-16s is a deadly force to be reckoned with, no matter the enemy. To get the most out of the Block-50, focus on assisting allies and cleaning up baited targets. The F-16 can be a menace by dipping in and out of fights, utilizing its effective HMD to sling AIM-9Ms at slow and distracted opponents. However, due to poor high-speed manoeuvrability, the F-16 should never be found alone, especially by multiple enemies. Poor high-speed agility can reduce responsiveness times for pilots, giving pursuing enemies crucial space for positioning. The F-16 can be easily overwhelmed when outnumbered, so the best way to combat the weakness is to avoid it altogether. By using careful target prioritization, a Block-50 can kill enemies and free up allies for assistance at the same time. Through practice, you will learn your plane by heart, finally unleashing the full potential of this vicious aircraft.
