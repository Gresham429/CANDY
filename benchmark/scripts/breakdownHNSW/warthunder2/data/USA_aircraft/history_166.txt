History of F-5A: 
The F-5A Freedom Fighter is a light fighter designed by Northrop in the 1950s. Designed as a private export venture, the aircraft was designed in both fighter and trainer variants (N-156F and N-156T). The F-5A entered service in the 1960s and was widely exported under the US's Military Assistance Program to developing countries. The F-5A would later be developed into the more advanced F-5E, and later on, serve as the basis of the YF-17 / F/A-18.
