Description of P-47D-25: 
One of the common complaints from early P-47 pilots was the razorback design which greatly limited visibility. In the past, there were attempts to fit a better canopy but it didn't gain any traction until 1943. As an experiment, a P-47 was taken and fitted with the bubble canopy from a Typhoon. After it was deemed successful, the P-47D-25 came to life at the Farmingdale production facility. It was fitted with a bubble canopy as well as a few minor modifications like a paddle-bladed propeller and could carry more fuel. The D-25 also came standard with the Pratt & Whitney R-2800-59 engine which could produce over 2,000 hp with water injection enabled. It was the main engine found in many Thunderbolt variants and around 11,000 were made. After the war was over, many P-47Ds found a new home in various countries like Chile, Iran, and more.
