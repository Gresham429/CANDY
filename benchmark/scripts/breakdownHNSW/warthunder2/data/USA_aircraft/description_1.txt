Description of P-26A-34_M2: 
In 1932, before testing with the XP-936 was done, the U.S. Army issued a statement for an improved XP-936 for production. Only a year later, the USAAC ordered over 100 examples with the designation P-26A. It was to be fitted with the Pratt & Whitney R-1340-27 Wasp radial engine that also boasted a supercharger. The R-1340-27 made around 500 hp but later variants made 600 hp. P-26As were delivered not long after and proved to be a decently advanced aircraft for its time.
