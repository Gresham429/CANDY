Usage of M.D.452_IIC: 
The M.D.452 IIC is generally more manoeuvrable than most other contemporary aircraft it faces, the only ones you would have a tough time turning with at this battle rating would be any of the Sabres. Since its roll rate is comparable to the Sabre's once the "New Boosters" modification is installed, the option of turnfighting becomes available, although speed will be bled at a relatively high rate. Still, like the predecessors of the Myst√®re II, boom & zooming should remain the first choice in engagements. Control stiffening doesn't appear under around 1,000-1,050 km/h, and devastating armament will take out an enemy target in a single pass. Furthermore, top speed in level flight is slightly below average, justifying even more that tactic.
