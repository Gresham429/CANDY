Description of SB2C-5_(France): 
The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver entered service with the US Navy in 1942, replacing the SBD Dauntless. It was a much larger aircraft that was capable of carrying much larger payloads, powered by the R-2600 Twin Cyclone engine and featuring an internal bomb bay for reduced drag. However, the Helldiver was not really successful, due to its poor survivability, and in many cases the F6F Hellcat fighter-bomber was capable of performing the same tasks. France purchased 110 SB2C-5 Helldivers in 1949 in replacement of their own SBD Dauntless dive bombers, these aircraft were used up until 1958 serving in the French Navy aboard aircraft carriers, and saw combat only in the First Indochina War.
