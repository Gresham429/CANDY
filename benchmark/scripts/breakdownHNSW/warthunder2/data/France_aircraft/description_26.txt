Description of A-35B_(France): 
The A-35B had its beginnings in the Vultee Model 72 in 1940. It was primarily developed for the French Air Force as a dive-bomber but the fall of France put a stop to that. The Model 72 was a unique design for dive bombers as the wings prevent the aircraft from straying off target during a dive-bombing run. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the US acquired many A-31s and Model 72s and later birthed the A-35 “Vengeance”. The A-35 had a better engine and other changes for flight performance. France would later receive almost 70 A-35A/Bs during the lend-lease program.
