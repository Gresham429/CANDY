Description of Challe%27s_Yak-9T_(France): 
This Yak-9T White 60 was flown by French pilot René M. P. A. Challe, who served in the Normandie-Niemen squadron, a French fighter squadron that fought on the Eastern Front of World War II under Soviet command. During the Battle of France, Challe was part of the GC III/7 and was shot down in his M.S.406, which led to his hospitalization. After recovering, he escaped occupied France in 1943 with eight fellow aviators through Spain and volunteered to join the Normandie-Niemen regiment in Tula, USSR. He was assigned to his Yak-9T White 60, where he painted the emblem of his previous squadron and acquired eight confirmed aerial victories. On his last flight on January 17, 1945, he was gravely injured when Minengeschoß rounds exploded in his cockpit, severely injuring his left hand and arm. Despite his injuries, he survived the engagement, the war, and recovered from his wounds. He passed away on April 4, 2006.
