History of Mirage_F1C-200: 
The Mirage F1C-200 is essentially a Mirage F1C with an air-refuelling probe. The addition of the air-refuelling probe also extended the length of the fuselage by 7 cm. Some Mirage F1C-200s also received a GPS in the 1990s. These F1C-200s were intended for long expeditionary missions and saw combat in places like Africa and the Middle East. During the early 1980s, Mirage F1C-200s provided air cover for SEPECAT Jaguars performing attack runs against the Libyan-backed insurgency in Chad. A few years later, the F1C-200s and Jaguars were redeployed again to Chad until 1992, when the government was overthrown. Mirage F1C-200s were also present in the United Arab Emirates during the Gulf War to supplement air defense with Qatari Mirage F1EDAs.
The Iraqis took the refuelling probes from the Mirage F1C-200s they had acquired and fitted them on their MiG-23s.
