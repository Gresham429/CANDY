Usage of H-75A-1: 
Energy retention lends this fighter to be a great zoomer, dropping in for a shot and then speeding back up to regain the energy advantage. With this aircraft having such a low stall speed; it makes a great fighter to practice rope-a-dope energy depletion manoeuvres. This requires the H-75-A1 pilot to bait another fighter into following them in a climb. As the attacker attempts to get guns on target, the pilot can start to spiral climb, causing the attacking aircraft to pull a tighter circle, hemorrhaging their energy. If done correctly, the attacking fighter will stall out and be completely helpless as they begin to fall back to the ground, allowing the H-75A-1 to roll over or Split-S and take out the stalled fighter below.
