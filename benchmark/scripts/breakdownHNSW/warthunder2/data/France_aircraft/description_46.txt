Description of F6F-5N_(France): 
The â–„F6F-5N Hellcat was acquired by France in the years following WWII. During the 1950s, France was still rebuilding its nation and its armed forces, and the easiest way to do so while domestic projects were developed was acquiring military surplus left after WWII. The F6F-5N was one of this cases, being a night fighter modified by Britain using the Hellcat as a basis. The aircraft was very similar to the original F6F-5 but this time, it included an AN/APS-6 search radar for interception at night and other inconvenient weather conditions. The French Navy bought 124 F6F-5s and fifteen F6F-5Ns between 1950-1953.
