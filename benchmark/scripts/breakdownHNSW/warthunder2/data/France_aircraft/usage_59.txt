Usage of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIN_(late): 
The Vautour II N is an interceptor, and for the most part, can only be played as such. Due to its very poor manoeuvrability, attempting to turn fight is akin to suicide. The Vautour is best at keeping its top speed and using tried and true boom and zoom tactics. There are too few bombers at the Vautour's BR, thus its best opportunity is head-on engagements. Both of the Vautour's loadouts are worthwhile in that role, the 4 x AA-20 Nord missiles may be manually-guided missiles, but they do not require mastery of manual guidance or even the usage of it to be worthwhile, they are proximity-fuze and are a perfect surprise head-on weapon. Launching 2 of them at the 2 km threshold can be particularly effective.
