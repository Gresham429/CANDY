History of P-63C-5_(France): 
The P-63C saw little use with the US Air Force, and most were exported via Lend-Lease to the USSR. However, France also placed an order for 300 P-63C Kingcobras, to be delivered in 1945; of these, 114 aircraft were delivered before the rest of the order was voided, as the US found it unprofitable to continue producing Kingcobras after the war's end. By the time of contract cancellation, 3 full squadrons had converted to the Kingcobra while many more planes weren't ready for service. The first squadron to convert to the P-63 was the II/9 "Auvergne", based in North Africa.
