Description of VB.10C-1: 
The VB.10C-1 was a heavy fighter designed in France, based in the V.G.33 that failed to enter production in WWII due to the capitulation of France in 1940. The aircraft was meant for post-war service with 200 aircraft ordered in 1946, however this was reduced to only 50 a few years later. Powered by two Hispano-Suiza HS 12Z Ars 15/16 engines, the aircraft was armed with four 20 mm cannons, although further versions also added six 12.7 mm HMGs. However, in the end, the order for this aircraft was cancelled, with the French Air Force deciding to rely on Allied aircraft such as the F6F, F8F, and F4U while their own jet-powered aircraft were being developed.
