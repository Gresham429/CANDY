History of F-84F_(IAF): 
In the late 1940's, the manufacturer 'Republic' sought to improve the performance of the F-84 in order to bring it closer in line with the F-86 Sabre. As a result, it developed a new variant of the Thunderjet, designated F-84F. The new aircraft featured, among other changes, a new swept wing and a more powerful engine than its predecessor. Although Republic initially intended the new aircraft to be an extensive modernization of the base F-84, possessing a high degree of part compatibility with preceding variants, in the end, only less than 20% of the parts were interchangeable, resulting in the F-84F Thunderstreak becoming its own independent design.
