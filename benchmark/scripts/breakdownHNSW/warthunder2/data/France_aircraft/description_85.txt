Description of Mirage_2000C-S5: 
A timeless classic, and an icon of delta-wing fighter design, the Mirage 2000C-S5 is the penultimate production variant of the "C" variant of the Mirage 2000. Unlike the earlier production models of the Mirage 2000C, this version comes equipped with an upgraded SNECMA M53-P2 engine, an Eclair chaff-flare dispenser to increase the number of countermeasures available, as well as an improved Thomson-CSF RDI radar that allowed the use of the much improved Matra Super 530D missile. For the time, it was a very important upgrade alongside the C-S4 variant, since it allowed the Mirage 2000 to be at the same level of the latest variants of the MiG-29 and F-16 in terms of technology and weapon systems.
