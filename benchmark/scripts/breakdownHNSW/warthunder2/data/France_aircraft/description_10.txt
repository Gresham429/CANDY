Description of V-156-F: 
The SB2U-2 was developed in the early 1930s and was sold to the French as the V-156-F in February 1939. Some minor changes were made during reassembly in France, including French radios and 7.5 mm machine guns, and the installation of dive brakes which had originally been rejected during American testing. These aircraft were deployed on the French aircraft carrier BÃ©arn; however, at the outbreak of the war, the carrier was deemed too slow for service, and both squadrons of V-156-F aircraft were transferred to land-based duty. The V-156-F was used continually until the French Armistice.
