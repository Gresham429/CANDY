History of Super_Etendard: 
The Super Étendard's history began in the late 1960s when France sought a replacement for its aging Étendard IV aircraft. Dassault Aviation designed the Super Étendard, introduced in the 1970s, as a carrier-based strike fighter. It featured a compact, agile airframe, advanced avionics, and a SNECMA Atar 8K-50 turbojet engine.
