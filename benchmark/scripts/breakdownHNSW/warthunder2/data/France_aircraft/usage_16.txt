Usage of Pallier%27s_D.510: 
The extremely limited 20 mm ammo supply should be guarded carefully and used only for heavier and larger targets where the destructive power of the HEF shells can make quick work of enemies. Most other fighters of the period will fall quickly enough to the 7.5 mm MAC rounds.
