Description of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIB: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour II was a French project with the intention of creating a capable multirole twin-engined aircraft that could be used as a frontline bomber, close air support, or as an all-weather interceptor. With different variants developed, each one to fulfil a separate task, the Vautour IIB was the bomber of the family. Compared to the previous Vautour IIA, this one added an additional crew member at the front of the aircraft in a transparent nose, tasked with acquiring the target to release the bombs. A total of 40 Vautour IIBs were built, with some being sold to Israel in 1960.
