History of D.501: 
The D.500 series of aircraft were developed in response to the C1 specification issued by the French Air Ministry in 1930. The specification mostly intended to replace France's inventory of old WW1 and 1920 era aircraft with more modern designs. Famous aircraft designer Ã‰mile Dewoitine, submitted his D.500 design and almost immediately caught the attention of the Air Ministry's officials. Shortly after the D.500 had its maiden flight in 1932, an order for 60 aircraft was placed in 1933, 10 of which were for the D.501. In essence, the D.501 was just a subvariant of the D.500. The two major differences lie in the powerplant and armament. Namely, the D.500 used a Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engine, whilst the D.501 was equipped with a 12Xcrs engine, that allowed for the installation of a 20mm cannon through the propellor hub. This change also caused the removal of the two nose-mounted machine guns from the original layout, found on the D.500. Whilst a single 20mm cannon, paired with a couple machine guns may seem like a laughable setup today, the sheer presence of an autocannon on an aircraft back then was deemed almost as a luxury.
