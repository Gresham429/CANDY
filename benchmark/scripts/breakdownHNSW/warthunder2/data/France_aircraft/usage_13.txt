Usage of F.222.2: 
The F.222.2 is a heavy-hitting bomber with okay manoeuvrability at low altitude and low airspeed and can carry a staggering 52x50 kg bombs while still in stock configuration. Combined with its frequent presence in Ground Strike matches with only light vehicles, it will make short work of any (or even all) groups of armoured cars and SPAA it crosses paths with, in addition to destroying an opposing team's entire complement of AAA and artillery in short order.
