History of Jaguar_A: 
The Jaguar A was the French variant of the SEPECAT Jaguar, developed jointly by France and the United Kingdom. The first prototype flew in late 1968, fitted with the Adour engine. The aircraft later flew at the Paris Air Show in 1969, and the further developed Jaguar A prototype, improved and designed for French service, flew in March of that year. After the commencement of production, the French Air Service accepted the first Jaguar A in December 1973, one of an eventual 160 Jaguar A aircraft that would serve with the Air Service. As well, the Air Ministry procured 40 additional Jaguar E trainers, to help train pilots for the Jaguar A.
