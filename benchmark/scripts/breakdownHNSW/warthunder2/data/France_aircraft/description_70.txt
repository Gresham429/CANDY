Description of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIN: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIN was last variant developed for the Vautour II program, intended to procure a twin-engine multirole heavy fighter capable of close air support, high-altitude bombing and high-altitude interception. The Vautour IIN was the all-weather interceptor variant, armed with the standard set of 4 x 30 mm DEFA cannons and operated by the pilot and navigator. The early variants of this aircraft lacked access to the radar-guided Matra R511 SARH missiles and instead used MACLOS-guided AA-20 Nords, for ground support, they could also carry AS-20 and AS-30 Nords, as well as bombs and rockets in external pylons and the internal bomb bay.
