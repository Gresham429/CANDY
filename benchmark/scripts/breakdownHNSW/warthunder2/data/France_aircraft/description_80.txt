Description of Mirage_F1CT: 
In July 1984, the new Mirage 2000 was starting to enter service with the French Air Force to replace the Mirage F-1C-200s in the frontline fighter role. As a result, the French Air Force was now left with a lot of leftover Mirage F1Cs to mothball, and in 1988 a program was launched to convert these F1Cs into a frontline ground attack aircraft to replace the ancient Mirage IIIEs and few Mirage 5s used by France in that role at the time. The Mirage F1CT program brought the avionics of the F1C up to the standard of the F1CR (reconnaissance variant), with the radar upgraded to the Cyrano IVM-R standard, adding a plethora of new air-to-ground modes for ground attack. In addition, an improved navigation/attack system outfitted with a laser rangefinder was installed under the nose for low-altitude interdiction, navigation, and the delivery of laser guided ordnance. The defensive suite was also overhauled with a new RWR, enlarged chaff/flare dispensers for SEAD missions, and modernized communication systems were also added. As a result, the Mirage F1CT also gained the ability to carry a variety of air-to-ground weapons, including rockets, cluster bombs and laser-guided bombs, all while retaining the original air-to-air armament of the F-1C fighter variant.
