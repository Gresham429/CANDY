Usage of SB2C-5_(France): 
The SB2C-5 enjoys a bomber spawn in RB, but using it as a pure bomber is not very productive since its bombload isn't very impressive; 2,000 lbs maximum is not enough to take out a base at its battle rating. As such, the bombs are best used against ground targets and pillboxes. The cannon armament, decent durability, and bomber spawn also make it good at hunting other bombers, who may not expect to be intercepted by another aircraft so quickly.
