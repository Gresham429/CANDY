Description of S.O.8000_Narval: 
The S.O.8000 Narval was a prototype naval fighter interceptor created by SNCASO in the late 1940s. It was powered by a French postwar development of the Junkers Jumo 213, the same that powered the Fw-190D fighters. The aircraft featured good climb rate and high altitude performance thanks to a supercharger, it was also meant to be capable of strike missions, similar to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. However the project was abandoned in the 1950s, due to the rapid development of jet engine technology.
