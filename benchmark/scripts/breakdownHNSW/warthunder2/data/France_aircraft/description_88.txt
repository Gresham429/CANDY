Description of Mirage_2000D-R1: 
The Mirage 2000D-R1 was the dedicated ground attack variant of the Mirage 2000, based in the Mirage 2000D, which in itself, was based in the Mirage 2000N, a nuclear strike variant. It had a conventional two-seat configuration, like most ground attackers, and incorporated a series of improvements to increase its survivability, like improved countermeasure pods, better electronic countermeasures, an improved RWR, and for increased accuracy against ground targets, it received the same weaponry as the Mirage 2000-5F would later receive, that being AS-30L air to ground missiles, laser guided bombs, and targeting pods. It still retained the same radar as the ones in the Mirage 2000C.
