History of F.222.2: 
Farman Aviation Works began working on the F.220 bomber design in 1925. This aircraft was based on a successful earlier design of the F.211 which was a parasol wing, four-engine monoplane utilising tractor and pusher engines. While the F.211 never entered production, it served as a base for the F.220 to be designed and built from. The first successful flight of the F.220 happened on 26 May 1932.
