History of Milan: 
Development of the Milan began in 1968 when Dassault, in cooperation with Swiss engineers, began working on a modification of the Mirage III, which became known as Milan or 'Kite'. Unlike the standard variants of the Mirage, the Milan received a pair of retractable canards on its nose section in order to improve the aircraft's low speed handling characteristics and shorten take-off distances. In addition, the aircraft was fitted with an uprated ATAR 9K-50 turbojet engine as well as a laser rangefinder.
