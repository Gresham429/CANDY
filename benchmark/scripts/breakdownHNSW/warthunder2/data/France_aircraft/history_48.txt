History of AD-4_(France): 
The AD-4 is part of a long line of piston-engined attack aircraft developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company, starting with the A-1 Skyraider, seeing service across the globe in various ground strike roles. The variant of the French AD-4 represented in War Thunder is the French AD-4NA, a variant of the formerly three-seated AD-4N night attack plane which was converted to a single-seated attacker in American Service before being sold to France, though France did also come into possession of the AD-4N.
