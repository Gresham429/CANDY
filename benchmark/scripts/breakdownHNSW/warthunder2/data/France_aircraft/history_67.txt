History of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIB: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIB was developed by Sud Aviation after World War Two to meet the demand for the French Arm√©e de l'Air. This was a challenging task, after the German occupation in France. Many aircraft design teams have scattered. France was also new to the new jet propulsion area. The requirements issued by the French government called for a jet-powered multi-role attack aircraft that can perform as a bomber, low-level attack aircraft, and an all-weather interceptor. SNCASO met those requirements with a modified version of the S.O 4000. The new plane was designated the S.O.4050 Vautour and was manufactured in three different variants. The plane would serve in the AdA for several decades before replaced the newer Dassault Mirage. The Vautour was also one of the stop-gap measures used by the AdA as a nuclear deterrent. The Vautour would later be exported to Israel and serve with the IAF to counter Egypt's IL-28 twin-engine bomber.
