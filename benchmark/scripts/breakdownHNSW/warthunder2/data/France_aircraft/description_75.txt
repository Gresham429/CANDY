Description of Mirage_IIIC: 
The Mirage IIICwas the first production model of the Mirage III series. It was quite similar to the earlier preproduction Mirage IIIA with just changes to the fuselage. The Mirage III design was made to be both an interceptor and a relatively capable dogfighter, thus the Mirage IIIC featured the regular delta wing configuration, a powerful Atar 09B turbojet engine with an afterburner, and was able to carry a sleek external fuel tank improved for supersonic speeds, but that could be exchanged for a small bomb payload. The Mirage IIIC was originally fitted with three pylons but this number was promptly increased to 5, its main weapon was the AIM-9B Sidewinder as well as its DEFA 30 mm cannons. The Sidewinder remained as its primary missile until the introduction of the Matra Magic 1. A total of 95 units were produced, and it remained in service until 1988.
