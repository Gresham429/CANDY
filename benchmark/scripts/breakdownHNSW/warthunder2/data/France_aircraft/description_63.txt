Description of F-86K_(France): 
The original F-86D was developed as a bomber interceptor and was outfitted with a retractable ventral rocket-rack which housed 24 x 2.75 in (70 mm) Mighty Mouse folding-fin aerial rockets. Lacking cannons or air-to-air missiles, the F-86D was limited in role strictly as a bomber hunter. In 1953, Italy approached North American Aviation in an attempt to modify the existing F-86D into a fighter-interceptor, however, the proposed changes proved too costly. This cost overage required scaling back the requirements and from this was produced the F-86K, a fighter-interceptor aircraft which was outfitted with 4 x 20 mm cannons and two AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles. Originally this aircraft was produced for the U.S., however, later the Italian manufacturer Fiat was licensed to also manufacture and produce this version of the fighter. France operated a total of 62 F-86Ks, built between 1956 and 1957 by Fiat, working as all-weather interceptors while the Mirage III was being developed.
