Description of Potez_633: 
The Potez 633 was the light bomber variant of the Potez 63 family of aircraft. It had a two man configuration, with a pilot and rear gunner. The aircraft proved to be relatively ineffective as a bomber in the Battle of France, suffering heavy losses due to enemy air superiority and the mediocre speed of the Potez 633, a problem shared with its interceptor counterparts, the Potez 630 and 631. While other nations such as China, Romania, and Greece also used the Potez, not all of them were delivered due to a French embargo on army equipment and other military assets in June 1939. The aircraft also served with Vichy France, although relegated to second line service.
