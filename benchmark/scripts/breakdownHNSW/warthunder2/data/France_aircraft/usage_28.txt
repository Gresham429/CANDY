Usage of N.C.223.3: 
Like its predecessor, the F.222.2, the N.C.223.3 is a heavy hitting bomber with okay manoeuvrability at low altitude and low air speed, and can carry a staggering 52 x 50 kg bombs. Combined with its frequent presence in Ground Strike matches with only light vehicles, it will make short work of any (or even all) groups of armoured cars and AAA it crosses paths with. However, the ability to carry larger bomb loads later in its upgrade tree turns it into an exceptionally capable base killer, often time wiping out bases solo. 5 of the 200 kg No.1 bombs can destroy a base, so with the upgraded bombload you should be able to easily destroy 3 bases, and keep all 7 x 100 kg No.1 bombs for the enemy airfield, or to destroy the fourth base in some maps . However, it is still capable of turning entire columns of medium tanks to flaming scrap if escorted in higher level battles, with Hispano gun turrets available if an enemy tries to attack the plane.
