Usage of VB.10-02: 
Like most heavy fighters, the VB.10-02 does well with a somewhat passive playstyle. Poor manoeuvrability means that dogfights against single engine fighters are generally a bad idea, and boom and zoom tactics should be used instead. Due to the VB.10-02's high dive speed and great energy retention after a dive, the plane performs excellently as an air defence fighter, capable exploiting a group of dogfighting enemies by diving into a preoccupied enemy to attack them and leave unharmed. As such, maintaining altitude advantage and situational awareness is a key of success. While the plane is lacking in armour, the excellent armament does allow you to win head-ons more often than not.
