History of Br.693AB2: 
Originally designed in response to a 1934 requirement for a three-seat heavy fighter, the Bréguet Bre.690C.3 (C.3 signifying it was a fighter manned by a 3-man crew) was rejected in favour of the Potez 630C.3 as Bréguet had chosen to ignore weight specifications that it found impossible to meet, instead proposing it to the French military as a multi-purpose aircraft. Following this rejection, Bréguet then revised it as a two-seat attack aircraft, with the navigator's position deleted and replaced by a bomb bay capable of holding 460 kg of bombs, and a revised armament of one fixed forward-firing 20 mm cannon supplemented by 2 forward firing 7.5 mm machine guns, one fixed rearward-firing 7.5 mm machine gun in a ventral position, and one flexible 7.5 mm machine gun manned by the rear gunner.
