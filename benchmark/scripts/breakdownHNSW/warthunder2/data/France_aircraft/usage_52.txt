Usage of S.O.8000_Narval: 
The Narval has a well-distinguished silhouette, almost looking like a cross between a P-38 lightning and a Me 163 Komet. The first thing you will notice is the interestingly designed pair of wings. The inboard leading edge of its wing was swept back 24 degrees, while the outboard section was swept back 13.5 degrees and incorporated a dihedral angle. The superb roll rate was achieved with a combination of small ailerons at the tip of the wings and spoilers along with clipped wings which only slightly reduced the plane's turning capability. It also wears large double slotted flaps designed to decrease speed for carrier operations.
