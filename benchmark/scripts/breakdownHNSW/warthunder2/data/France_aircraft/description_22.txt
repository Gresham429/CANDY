Description of D.520: 
The Dewoitine D.520 was a French monoplane fighter employed during WWII and is considered by many as one of the best French-made fighters to be produced during WWII. The aircraft was powered by either the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 or 12Y-49 engines. The aircraft featured one Hispano-Suiza 20 mm cannon and four wing-mounted MAC 1934 7.5 mm LMGs. The plane served along both sides in the war, with both the Vichy and Free French air forces possessing a number of the aircraft, employed during the Battle of France with good results against the Luftwaffe and against the Italian Air Force, as well as in Syria in 1941 against British and Free French Forces alongside the German Luftwaffe.
