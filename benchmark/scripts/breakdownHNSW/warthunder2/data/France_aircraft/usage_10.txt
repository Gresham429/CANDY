Usage of V-156-F: 
The V-156-F is a slow aircraft which leads it to having two options. The first is to hug the terrain. While flying to your target of choice (AAA sites, AA Vehicles or bases), fly along the terrain, utilize what hills and valleys there are to fly through. Time on target may be limited before the enemy gets there so line up your bombing run and drop bombs. This aircraft can manoeuvre fairly well, utilizing elevator and rudder controls and a nice turn time (upgraded) of 22 seconds (RB), you can quickly flip this aircraft around and return to ground attacking targets you just flew over.
