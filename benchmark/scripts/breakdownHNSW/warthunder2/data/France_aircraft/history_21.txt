History of V.G.33C-1: 
The VG33 C-1 was a member of the VG series that was designed in 1936. It was aimed to provide a solution to the French Airforce's lack of modern fighter aircraft. To achieve this, it used a wooden structure, which could utilise France's forests, alleviating the shortages in aluminium. It was designed to the same contract as the C.R.714 and the Bloch MB.700. The Vg.30 was originally intended to be powered by a Potez 12Dc inline engine, but due to development issues with the engine, the prototype first flew in October 1938 with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs. The VG 33 itself was a modified version of the VG-31, which used the  Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 and which first flew in 1939, with great success.
