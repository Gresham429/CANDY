Usage of F-100D_(France): 
The F-100 truly shines when in an up-tier situation. Unlike the F4 Phantom II or the MiG-21, the F-100 is equipped with leading-edge slats. This gives it a much higher angle of attack at low speeds, allowing the F-100 to out-turn both the F4 and the MiG-21. However, at lower battle ratings, the F-100D is best at Boom & Zoom tactics. When fighting at a lower battle rating, the F-100 has some bad flying characteristics at low speeds which includes flying like a rock with wings. At high speeds, the F-100 is a breeze to fly because of its all-flying tail and boosted controls. It has a massive angle of attack, so once you get on someone's tail, there's pretty much no escape. Best way to use the F-100D is to start climbing. 5,000 meters is usually a good altitude to climb to. Since you can out-climb most subsonic aircraft in the game, Boom & Zoom tactics should be used. Climb high, make a pass, then climb away. Be extremely careful to not bleed energy and don't turn when subsonic planes are around, they will be able to outmanoeuvre the F-100D.
