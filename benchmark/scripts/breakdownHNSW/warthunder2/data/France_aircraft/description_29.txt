Description of LeO_451_early: 
The LeO 451 started development in the early 1930s as the French Air Force wanted to procure a new light bomber for their young bombing branch. The first prototype flew in 1937, with only minor issues, aside from that, it displayed excellent performance, it used a pair of Hispano-Suiza engines. A second prototype was built using different engines with testing in 1938. However, the engines of the second prototype could not be obtained in time for the aircraft's production, but even with this setback, the aircraft's numbers quickly raised before the Invasion of France in May 1940. The aircraft suffered heavy losses against German pilots that had complete air superiority, however it performed much better against Italian forces in southern France.
