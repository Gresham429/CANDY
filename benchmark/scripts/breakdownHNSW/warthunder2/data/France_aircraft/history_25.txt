History of F6F-5_(France): 
The F6F-5, as a battle-hardened veteran of the Second World war, was chosen as a potential carrier-based naval fighter and strike aircraft by the French AÃ©ronavale, in the process of rebuilding France's military. Thus, the Air Ministry procured a total of 124 F6F-5 and 15 F6F-5N aircraft from Grumman between 1950 and 1953. The aircraft were based on the French aircraft carriers CV Arromanches (formerly HMS Colossus), CVL Lafayette (formerly USS Langley) and CVL Bois-Belleau (formerly USS Belleau Wood).
