Description of Mirage_F1C: 
The Mirage F1C was a result of an experiment, when a smaller swept wing design of the Mirage outfitted with the latest and more powerful SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine garnered the interest of Dassault engineers as a possible future replacement to the existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters. Dassault began conducting further design work under the official name Mirage F1 as part of a private venture. In late 1966, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight and the initial test results were positive. Shortly after the French Air Force expressed interest in the aircraft and adopted the development program. Entering official service with the French Air Force in March 1974, the Mirage F1 took part in their first combat operations a decade later flying sorties against insurgent forces in Chad. Mirage F1s also took part in French operations during the Gulf War in 1990. It was also operated by several countries like Spain, Morocco, Qatar, and Iraq.
