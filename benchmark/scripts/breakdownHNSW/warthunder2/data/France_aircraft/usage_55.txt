Usage of M.D.450B_Ouragan: 
The usual strategy for the M.D.450B Ouragan is to play as a Boom & Zoom aircraft. It retains energy in vertical turns and can perform "BnZ" manoeuvres well. When you takeoff, it is recommended to gain speed immediately. After gaining speed, you can side-climb up to 2,500 - 3,000 m then head to the centre of the battlefield. When you're finally in the centre, you will have already gained significant speed by accelerating. Then you can commence Boom & Zoom tactics. This strategy goes as follows: Dive, engage, zoom up to 2,500 - 3,000 m, loop around, look for a suitable target, rinse and repeat. If you find yourself in a bad situation where you cannot use the recommended tactics, then your last resort option would be to turn. Beware that this bleeds a lot of speed and usually results in the M.D.450 becoming an easy target.
