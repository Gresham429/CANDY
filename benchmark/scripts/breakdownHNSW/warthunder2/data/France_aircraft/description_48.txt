Description of AD-4_(France): 
In the late 1950s, France received around 93 AD-4 airframes as part of the US Navy's surplus. 40 Skyraiders were the NA variant meanwhile the rest were AD-4Ns.  It featured four 20 mm cannons, a strengthened undercarriage, and other minor changes. Escadron II/20 was the first squadron to receive the Skyraiders in 1960, and two more squadrons would receive them. French Skyraiders were in service for just over ten years until they were considered obsolete and retired.
