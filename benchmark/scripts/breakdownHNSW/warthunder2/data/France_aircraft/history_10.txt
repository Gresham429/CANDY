History of V-156-F: 
The V-156-F had its origins in a French variant of the American Vought SB2U Vindicator carrier-based dive bomber. The aircraft was intended to operate as a naval dive bomber off of the French aircraft carrier BÃ©arn. The aircraft underwent a series of major modifications before entering service with the French - the airbrakes were changed to include outerwing split brake flaps, the avionics were replaced with French versions, and the armament was changed to consist of French Mle 1923 machine guns. The aircraft also had its "bomb crutch" bomb displacement system removed due to security reasons, and was replaced by French Alkan bomb sets.
