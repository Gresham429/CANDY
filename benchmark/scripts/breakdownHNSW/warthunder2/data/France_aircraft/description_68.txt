Description of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIA: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour II was a French project with the intention of creating a capable multirole twin-engined aircraft that could be used as a frontline bomber, close air support, or as an all-weather interceptor. With different variants developed, each one to fulfil a separate task, the Vautour IIA was the one designed for the CAS role, and the first one to be developed. The Vautour IIA was built between 1956 and 1959 and with a single crewmember, the pilot. Being the first variant of the Vautour II, some things needed improvements, like the SNECMA ATAR 101E3 engines, that were improved to the E5 version in the other variants, with access to more thrust and WEP.
