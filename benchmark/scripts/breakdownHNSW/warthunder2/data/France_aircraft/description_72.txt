Description of F-84F_(IAF): 
During the Suez Crisis of 1956, the French Air Force deployed the F-84F Thunderstreak covertly with repainted Israeli markings to aid the IAF against Egypt. Employed primarily in a ground-attack role, the F-84F contributed to the military intervention force alongside British and Israeli forces. Operating from bases in the French territories in North Africa, the Thunderstreak executed bombing missions against Egyptian targets in the Sinai Peninsula. While the F-84F demonstrated its versatility in ground-attack capabilities, the conflict marked a transitional period in military aviation, with the advent of more advanced and specialized aircraft. The Suez Crisis ultimately highlighted both the strengths and limitations of the F-84F Thunderstreak in a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape.
