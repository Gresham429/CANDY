Description of F-100D_(France): 
The French Air Force was the first non-US air force to receive the F-100 Super Sabre, starting in 1958. A total of 85 F-100Ds and 15 F-100Fs (total of 100 aircraft) were delivered to France and assigned to the NATO 4th Allied Tactical Air Force. More famously, the French F-100s were used on combat missions flying from bases in France against targets in Algeria. When France withdrew from NATO's military command structure in 1967, deployed F-100s were transferred to bases in France vacated by the USAF. The last unit using the F100 was the 4/11 Jura Squadron, based in Djibouti, which kept the F-100 until 1978.
