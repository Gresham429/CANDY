History of Potez_631: 
In 1934, the French Air Ministry issued a requirement for a new twin-engine heavy fighter, capable of both day-fighter and night-fighter roles. The original Potez 630 prototype was designed to fulfil this role, while the Potez 631 was a re-engined variant of the 630 prototype. In July 1937, an initial order for 40 Potez 631 day-fighters was placed by the Air Ministry, and on August 2nd 1938, the first Potez 631 was accepted by the French Air Service. The aircraft was immediately used to re-equip units using the obsolete Les Mureaux 113 fighters then being used as night figher aircraft.
