Usage of M.S.406C1: 
The MS.406C1 retains its energy well and is best utilized for energy fighting or Boom & Zoom situations. This aircraft can be used for head-on attacks using its cannon, however, be careful as the MS.406C1 does not have any armour protection.  It will be best to get a few bursts off at range and then manoeuvre out of the head-on. When using this aircraft in a bomber-hunter role, it is best to avoid flying towards the rear or sides of this aircraft as typically this is where most of the bomber's defensive weapons are pointed.  It is best to come at the front of the bomber from either below or from above (make sure you have energy as if you are near stall speed, you will be an easy target for gunners) and make strafing shots and wait until you are out of gunner range to turn and attempt a second pass.
