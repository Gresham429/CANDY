History of Martin_167-A3: 
The Martin Model 167 medium bomber was developed as a response to a set of requirements issued by the USAAC in 1938. Following these requirements, Martin developed its Model 167 bomber, which received its official testing designation of XA-22. However, despite showing favorable performance, the XA-22 lost out to the Douglas DB-7 (which became A-20 Havoc) during the competition, which resulted in Douglas getting the contract with the USAAC. What would usually spell disaster for most projects that suffered a fate like this, turned out to not to be the case for Martin's design. With an armed conflict looming over Europe, nations such as France and the UK were desperately stocking up with any military equipment that was on offer, including aircraft. France in particular was looking into buying any available aircraft from manufacturers abroad as the domestic production was limited. These manufacturers were in many cases American companies, just like Martin. In any case, the first orders for French export versions of Martin's new bomber soon came in, effectively sparing the project from ruin.
