Description of P-40F-5_Lafayette_(France): 
The P-40F differed from earlier P-40 variants by having the Merlin engine. The Allison V-1710 engine made around 1,150 hp but the Merlin engine produced 1,300 hp; a 12% increase. One way to tell a P-40F from earlier variants was the lack of an air scoop on top of the engine. To increase stability, the fuselage was lengthened. The P-40F also brought with it the nickname "Warhawk". A significant portion of all P-40Fs built were sent to the Royal Air Force under the Lend-Lease program. However, many of the P-40Fs sent to the RAF were either returned to the US or lost in shipping. Some P-40Fs were sent to the "Free French" Air Force and saw use in North Africa. The French P-40F was named "Lafayette", which was based on the French squadron (GC 2/4 La Fayette) who used them.
