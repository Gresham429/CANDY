Description of Mirage_IIIE: 
The Mirage IIIE was designed to be closer to a multirole fighter compared to the interception-focused Mirage IIIC. It featured a British-made pulse-Doppler navigation radar located below the cockpit, as well as increased fuel capacity, a more modern SNECMA ATAR 09 turbojet engine, and improved avionics located directly behind the cockpit. A total of 192 aircraft were built by Dassault for the French Air Force, by 1971 it had become the most widely produced variant of the Mirage III.
