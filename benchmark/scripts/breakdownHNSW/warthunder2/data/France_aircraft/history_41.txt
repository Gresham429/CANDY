History of P-47D-22-RE_(France): 
According to the rather sparse information, the livery of this P-47D-22-RE was based on the No.63 aircraft (tail no. 226157; built no. 42-26157, 619th among the 850 P-47D-22-RE) of the Free French Air Force. It served in the GC II/3 "Dauphin√©" (3rd Squadron, 2nd Fighter Wing) alongside USAAF and other Free French squadrons from Alto airfield, Corsica. There are no records of its whereabouts during the WWII or after the war. [1][2][3]
