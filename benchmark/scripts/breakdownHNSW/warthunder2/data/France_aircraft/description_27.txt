Description of M.B.175T: 
The M.B.175T was an adaptation of the Bloch MB.170 for naval purposes. After WWII, France had to use any aircraft to its disposal to rearm their air force; thus the M.B.175T was created, the most important upgrade being the introduction of a single F5W torpedo, which, paired with the aircraft's long range, made it suitable for maritime patrol. The aircraft was retired in 1950 with the introduction of more modern fighter-bombers like the F6F.
