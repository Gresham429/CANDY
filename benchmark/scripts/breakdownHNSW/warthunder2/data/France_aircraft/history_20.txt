History of M.S.410: 
As the M.S.406 began entering squadron service in 1939, engineers at Morane-Saulnier continued working on the design, aiming to improve it. Several changes were made to the base design, which included the replacement of the old wing design with a new one, increased and improved offensive capabilities and the replacement of the old retractable radiator with a fixed one, among others. The applied changes resulted in the new M.S.410 being able to achieve somewhat better performance than its predecessor, namely reaching a slightly higher top speed. Right after the M.S.410 entered production, France capitulated in June 1940, halting the production of the aircraft after the fifth machine was constructed.
