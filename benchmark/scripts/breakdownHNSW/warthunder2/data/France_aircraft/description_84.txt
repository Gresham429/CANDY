Description of Mirage_F1C-200: 
The Mirage F1C was a result of an experiment, when a smaller swept wing design of the Mirage outfitted with the latest and more powerful SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine garnered the interest of Dassault engineers as a possible future replacement to the existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters. Thus the Mirage F1 was born, and it went into service with France in 1974. The Mirage F1C-200 is very similar to the Mirage F1C, but it now has access to an air-refuelling probe also extended the length of the fuselage by 7 cm. Some Mirage F1C-200s also received a GPS in the 1990s. These F1C-200s were intended for long expeditionary missions and saw combat in places like Africa and the Middle East. During the early 1980s, Mirage F1C-200s provided air cover for SEPECAT Jaguars performing attack runs against the Libyan-backed insurgency in Chad. In the Middle East, the Iraqis took the refuelling probes from the Mirage F1C-200s they had acquired and fitted them on their MiG-23s.
