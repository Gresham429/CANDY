Description of Mystere_IVA: 
The Mystere IVA was a major milestone for France in their process to upgrade their Air Force to a global power status. The Mystere IV was the first aircraft capable of transonic speeds in service with the French Air Force. Based upon the lessons learned from the Mystere II, it had very important upgrades in avionics and aerodynamics, helping the aircraft reach the desired speeds. The first 50 Mystere IVA production aircraft were powered by British Rolls-Royce Tay turbojets, while the remainder had the French-built Hispano-Suiza Verdon 350 version of that engine. In total, France operated 6 squadrons of Mystere IVs, most of which were purchased under a United States Offshore Procurement contract.
