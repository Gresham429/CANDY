Description of M.D.450B_Barougan: 
The Barougan ("battle" in Arabic),  was a very minor off-shoot of the M.D.450B Ouragan. The main difference was the new gear design that would allow the Barougan to take off from undeveloped runways. The nose gear stayed the same; however, the main gear in the center of the aircraft was very different. The Barougan had four wheels in the center to help absorb the load from grass runways and it proved to be a good design. A tail parachute was also added to decrease the landing distance and make it more viable. Unfortunately for the Barougan, the program was cut short due to budget constraints and was reconverted back to its original configuration.
