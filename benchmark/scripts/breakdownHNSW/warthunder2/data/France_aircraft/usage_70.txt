Usage of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIN: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIN should be used with a careful mindset, make sure to pick your targets wisely. You should always load a minimum of 8 minutes of fuel, and take advantage of your jet bomber spawn. Depending on your loadout, there are 2 ways to go for bases. You can either dive bomb from an altitude, allowing you to stay safe from enemy jet fighters who are likely still climbing to altitude. However, as you will be diving from a high altitude, you can potentially risk compressing your own aircraft. To counter this, use your airbrakes and manage your throttle when necessary. Once the base is bombed, you can return straight to the base. The second option is to convert your energy at spawn straight into speed, going as fast as possible to the nearest base, dropping ordnance, and pulling out. This allows you to bomb faster, but leaves you much exposed to the enemy fighters who would be coming out of spawn.
