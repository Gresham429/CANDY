Description of AD-4NA_(France): 
To combat the imminent threat from insurgents in Algeria, France purchased 100+ AD-4s in 1959. Five of the AD-4s were AD-4NAs but all 113 AD-4/Ns were converted to NA configuration by SFERMA. This resulted in the removal of radar equipment and 3-seater AD-4s were reconverted to single-seater versions. The AD-4NAs were deployed in Algerian to fight off the Algerian National Liberation Front. They also saw action in Chad with French mercenaries piloting them. France later sent the AD-4NAs to other countries as they were phased out in the 1970s.
