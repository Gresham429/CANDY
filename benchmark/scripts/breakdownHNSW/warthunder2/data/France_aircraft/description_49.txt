Description of F4U-7: 
Intended for the French Aéronavale, the F4U-7 Corsair was developed to fulfill France's urgent need for a carrier aircraft. America responded to the call with the F4U-7, an F4U-4 airframe with the ground attack capability of the AU-1, a ground attack-focused Corsair. The F4U-7s were some of the last Corsairs to be produced in its long production run of 13 years. France began receiving the new Corsairs in 1953 and retired them 11 years later in 1964. During its service, the F4U-7 saw combat in many places like Algeria and Vietnam. Much like in WW2, F4U-7s flew sortie after sortie with minimal losses.
