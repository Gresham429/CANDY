Description of M.B.162: 
Based upon the civilian airliner Bloch M.B.160 already in service, the M.B.162 was intended to be a heavy bomber, designed by the Société des Avions Marcel Bloch, later known as Dassault Aviation after the end of WWII. The Bloch M.B.162, although based on a civilian airliner, shared very little with its unarmed counterpart, the most important changes to the design were the different wing configuration and, since it was meant for military usage, the main cargo bay was remodelled to fit bombs and other payloads. The aircraft was never used, since it was captured by Germany before it could enter service.
