Usage of LeO_451_early: 
The LeO 451 can operate as a low-level attacker with relatively decent chances of survival thanks to the 20 mm dorsal gun and its relatively high performance. The LeO 451 is very fast, which is both to its benefit and detriment: it can outrun many enemies, but its wing rip speed is very close to its top speed. A prolonged dive of only 15 degrees, even with 0% throttle, can result in your wings ripping. This wing ripping problem is exacerbated by its good energy retention at high speed, making it harder to lose speed by turning even if combined with dropping throttle.
