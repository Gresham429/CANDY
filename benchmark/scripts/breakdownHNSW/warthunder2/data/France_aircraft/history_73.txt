History of Vautour_IIA_IDF/AF: 
The French Vautour twin-engine bomber had been produced in three variants between 1956 and 1959. In 1960, after four years in service, the French Armee de l'Air divested itself of its 25 surviving Vautour II-A single seat ground attack planes, along with its 40 II-B two-seater bombers, selling them to Israel, which kept them in service until the 1970s.
