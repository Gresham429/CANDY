Description of Potez_630: 
The Potez 630 was a heavy twin-engined fighter designed by the French Air Force in the late 1930s and meant to compete with the German Bf 110. The aircraft saw service in the late interwar period and in the Second World War during the Battle of France and later, with Vichy France. The Potez 630 was considered ineffective, mainly due to its low speed and poor manoeuvrability. After Germany seized all Vichy French aircraft, the Potez 630 was relegated to second line duties while frontline service remained for better aircraft such as the Bf 110.
