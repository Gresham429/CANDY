Description of Vautour_IIA_IDF/AF: 
The Vautour IIA was a jet-powered attack aircraft designed by France during the 1950s. It was operated by Israel alongside the IIN variant. Armed with cannons and rockets, it was used in aerial reconnaissance duties but had the capabilities to perform Close Air Support missions thanks to its large amount of anti-ground ordnance. A total of 25 Vautour IIAs were sold to Israel from the inventories of the French Air Force. The aircraft participated in the Six Days War and Yom Kippur War, and was retired shortly after.
