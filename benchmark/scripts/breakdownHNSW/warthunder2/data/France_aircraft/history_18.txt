History of Late_298D: 
Built as a successor to their earlier lacklustre Latécoère 290 torpedo bomber float plane, the new 298 outperformed its predecessor by wide margins and offered more capabilities. Not fast, its large wings did give it more manoeuvrability, aided by full-span flaps. Torpedoes and bombs were mounted in a semi-recessed bay (also called a "crutch"), and 2 fixed 7.5 mm machine guns plus 1 more defensive mount at the rear, a potent arsenal for 1938's warplanes.
