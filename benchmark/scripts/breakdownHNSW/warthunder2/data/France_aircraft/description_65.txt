Description of F-84F_(France): 
With the introduction of the first jet-powered domestically produced French aircraft, the French Air Force required a dedicated close air support and strike platform. With the Vautour II still in development and also being a very large aircraft for certain strike missions, France looked elsewhere for an aircraft capable of fulfilling this role. With the introduction of the United States of the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, France negotiated the acquisition of this aircraft, already having experience operating the regular F-84. The aircraft was introduced in 1954 with the USAF, and by 1955 the first F-84Fs arrived, a total of 328 F-84Fs and 88 RF-84Fs were bought from the US.
