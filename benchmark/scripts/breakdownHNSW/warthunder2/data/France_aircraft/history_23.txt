History of Potez_630: 
The Potez 630 was a twin-engined heavy fighter designed and used by the French Air Force during the late 1930s and into the Second World War. Designed as a contemporary to the German Bf 110, the Potez 630 was designed for both day-fighter and night-fighter roles. The Potez 630 saw service during the late-interwar period and into the Second World War, where it proved to be quite ineffective due to its slow speed. After the fall of France, the Vichy french government continued using the Potez 630 for fighter duties; this would continue until mid-1942 when Germany seized all Vichy-French aircraft; the Potez 630 was subsequently relegated to second-line duties and failed to see frontline service for the rest of the war.
