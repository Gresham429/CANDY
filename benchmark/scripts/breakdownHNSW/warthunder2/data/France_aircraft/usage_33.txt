Usage of VB.10C-1: 
The VB.10C-1, like most heavy fighters, is reliant on side climbing to engage enemy fighters, however this isn't the only way to play the VB.10C-1, if you decide to side climb and wait for enemy planes to drop down to lower altitudes they will find themselves in peril when a experienced pilot in a VB.10C-1 comes booming past with its quick dive rate and deadly armament of 4 x 20 mm Hispano 404 cannons. The best tactic when flying solo is Boom & Zoom and play as the team's support fighter, as its great acceleration and heavy weight can allow you to make fast attacks against unsuspecting enemy fighters at lower altitudes that are pre-occupied with fighting friendly aircraft. The heavy weight can also help carry the planes speed when extending and helps retain a bit of speed when going back into a climb, be aware however that the VB.10C-1's size and weight makes it a considerable target if you happen to miss your engagement. The best tactic when flying in a group of two or more is to help teammates that are struggling in a dogfight with enemy fighters, as a large target the VB.10C-1 can distract enemy fighters and outrun most using its advantage in weight and energy which allows teammates to slide onto the enemies six o'clock and finish them off.
