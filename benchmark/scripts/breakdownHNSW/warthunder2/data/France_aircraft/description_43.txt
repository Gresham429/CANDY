Description of F-6C-10-NA: 
The P-51C/F-6C was a giant improvement over previous Mustangs. It had finally begun a new era of Mustangs that would be powered by the Merlin engine. The idea was spurred on in 1942, and P-51 Mustang airframes were shortly redesigned to fit the new engine. The airframe was strengthened, and certain control surfaces were changed. Merlin-powered P-51Cs would be one of the best-performing aircraft of their time, rivaling German aircraft like the Fw 190 and Bf 109. It was also a big improvement over the Allison-powered Mustangs, which lacked significant high-altitude performance. Due to the power increase, the P-51Cs also had their suspended armament weight limit increased, and more fuel tanks were added. A big 246-litre (65-gal) tank sat behind the pilot to increase the range. The F-6C was essentially a P-51C with two cameras for reconnaissance duties. The aircraft was quite popular and soon saw service with France, who conducted recon missions over Germany late in the war.
