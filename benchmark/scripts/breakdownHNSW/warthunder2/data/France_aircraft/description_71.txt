Description of Milan: 
The Milan started being developed in 1968 after the Swiss Air Force presented its interest in acquiring a modified Mirage III with more manoeuvrability and specialized in tactical support. Thus, the Milan was built, with the Mirage III as a basis but with the weapon systems of the Jaguar. The biggest improvement came in the form of retractable whiskers located on the nose of the aircraft, which reduced takeoff distance and provided more lift. The Milan took its maiden flight on May 29, 1970, however, in 1972, the Swiss Air Force decided to upgrade its Hunters and instead buy the Northrop F-5.
