Usage of D.501: 
The D.501 is a French fighter which can be utilized for air-to-air combat or ground attack on light ground units (armoured vehicles and mobile AAA units). Good speed and manoeuvrability allows this aircraft to use its rudder and ailerons to roll, turn and manoeuvre out of tight spots. When going after ground units, this aircraft can make an attack and then loop up and back over down onto remaining targets with ease. The 20 mm cannon adds an extra punch which many early aircraft do not have and can be used to great effect on other aircraft, including larger bombers. However, thanks to its bad survivability, take care when engaging bombers, and remember: don't get shot at.
