Usage of Mirage_F1C: 
The most effective way of using the Mirage F1C in Air Realistic battles is to play a support role. Try to stay behind your team and target slow and distracted enemies using the powerful air-to-air missiles. Considering the poor top speed and manoeuvrability of the Mirage F1C, it doesn't stand much chance in duels against most enemies, even against uptiered fighters.
