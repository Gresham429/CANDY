Description of Super_Etendard: 
After the navalized version of the SEPECAT Jaguar was cancelled, France was left with a dire need for an aircraft to replace their aging fleet of Etendard IVMs for carrier operations. There were several import proposals at first, including A-4 and A-7 aircraft from the USA, but ultimately, it was decided instead to use an indigenous modernization of the Etendard, dubbed the Super Etendard. The primary upgrades were to the avionics, which would come from modern Dassault aircraft and were already proven on platforms like the late Mirage IIIs and the early Mirage 2000s. The Super Etendard's primary upgrades were a new engine, and new targeting systems allowing it to use new anti-ship and laser-guided ordnance.
