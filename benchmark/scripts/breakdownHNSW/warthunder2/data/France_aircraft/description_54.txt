Description of NC.900: 
The SNCAC NC.900 had its beginnings quite early in the war. Cravant, a chalk quarry, was abandoned until a French builder saw the quarry as a place for an aircraft factory. However, that plan wouldn't come to fruition due to the German invasion. The quarry was left alone for quite a while until the Germans utilized the quarry as a repair facility for their Fw 190s. As the tides turned in the war and Germany was pushed back from France, the repairmen at the quarry had to destroy all the Fw 190s that would be left behind. That plan failed and left many Fw 190s intact, and they were soon discovered by French forces. Due to the large number of aircraft and parts, it was decided to utilize the Fw 190 and redesignate it as the NC.900. Many NC.900s were cobbled together from different Focke-Wulf variants and would prove consequential later. After the first unit was assigned to the NC.900, problems quickly began. Sabotage and reliability issues plagued the NC.900s. Furthermore, the squadron flying them, Normandie-Niemen, hated the Fw 190 due to fighting them earlier in the war. It was quickly removed from service, and many were scrapped.
