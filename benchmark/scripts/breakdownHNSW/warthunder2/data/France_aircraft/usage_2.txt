Usage of D.373: 
Maintaining speed with this aircraft is a must, as a slow D.373 is an easy target. Initial spawning into a map should lead a D.373 pilot to climb and gain altitude. This will give you an advantage over most other pilots upon reaching the combat area, as you can select which enemy plane to dive on and attack. With a diving attack, you will gain speed which will allow you to quickly gain on the enemy aircraft to fire off a burst of rounds and then climb back up for altitude. If you decide to tail an enemy plane after a dive, you will risk bleeding off your energy. When attacking an enemy plane, attempt to attack when you see the greatest surface area of the fuselage and wings. If tailing a fighter, wait for them to turn or pull-up to expose the most surface area. When turn fighting or looping, utilise your rudder to sharpen your turning ability.
