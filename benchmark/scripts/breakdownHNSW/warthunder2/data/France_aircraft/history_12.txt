History of Potez_633: 
The Potez 633 was one of the numerous derivatives of the Potez 63. It was a light bomber, and it had a two-man crew: a pilot and a rear gunner. A contract for the production of 115 aircraft was awarded to SNCAN by the French Air Force. In 1938 though, it was decided that the light bombers had to have a crew of three, and the contract was cancelled. Nevertheless, the Potez 633 was offered for export with some success: Greece bought twenty-four aircraft, China bought four, Romania ordered forty and the Swiss air force bought one.
