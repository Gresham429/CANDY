Description of PBY-5A_Late_(France): 
In the early 1940s, France placed an order for 30 PBY-5 Catalinas soon after the British placed their first production order for the aircraft. However, the delivery was never fulfilled since France capitulated before the aircraft could be delivered. France also acquired 3 PBY-5A Catalinas from the Royal Canadian Air Force to serve in the Caribbean since their islands lacked proper airfields. These PBY-5As lacked the armament of the Catalina and were used in civil roles, mainly moving passengers.
