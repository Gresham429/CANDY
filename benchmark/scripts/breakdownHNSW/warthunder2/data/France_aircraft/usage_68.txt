Usage of S.O.4050_Vautour_IIA: 
The S.O.4050 Vautour IIA should be used like the Hunter, but more aggressively. Always load 8 minutes of fuel, use the bomber spawn to spawn at 3,000 meters, rush to a base, drop your bombs then rush to the enemy airfield to catch enemies off-guard. Besides catching enemies off-guard, the Vautour IIA can cause the enemy team to panic by rushing - when enemy players see a Vautour going faster than 1,000 km/h and they're a lot slower - they tend to panic, causing them to scatter around to find space in order to gain speed which could possibly ruin teamwork.
Do NOT turn. The Vautour is very bad at turning and rolling, it should be used as an exclusive boom and zoomer - like the Hunter. Gain speed, engage, zoom up, loop around, dive, rinse and repeat. The Vautour has excellent energy retention characteristics.
