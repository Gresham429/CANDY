History of F-100D_(France): 
The F-100 Super Sabre (or 45-Sabre) saw its first foreign service with the French Air Force. A total of 100 Super Sabres were ordered by the French, comprising 85 F-100Ds and 15 F-100Fs. The first of these aircraft arrived in May of 1958. At that time, France was a full member of NATO - as a result, most French Super Sabres were initially assigned to the 4th Allied Tactical Air Force, based in Germany. Following France's withdrawal from NATO, French Super Sabres were relocated to French air bases as Escadres (squadrons) No. 3 and No. 11.
