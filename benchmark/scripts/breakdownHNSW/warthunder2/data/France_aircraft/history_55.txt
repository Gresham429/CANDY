History of M.D.450B_Ouragan: 
French aircraft designer and Resistance fighter Marcel Bloch's aim when the war ended was to put France's aeronautical industry back on the map and reduce dependence on foreign aircraft for L'Armee de l'Air. The M.D. 450 Ouragan (Hurricane) was the first jet fighter to be completely designed and manufactured in France. In total 350 were built for French service, 104 for the Indian Air Force, and 12 for the Israelis. Entering service in 1952, it was a front-line fighter until the swept-wing Mystere arrived in 1955, and continued in operational service in France until the mid-1960s, after 1961 as training aircraft.
