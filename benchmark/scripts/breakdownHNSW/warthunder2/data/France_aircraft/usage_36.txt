Usage of P-63C-5_(France): 
The P-63C-5 is a superb energy fighter, especially at low-to-mid altitudes, with a very respectable turn performance. Its extremely high top speed and climb rate at low altitudes, along with good turn performance, allow it to out-energy most opponents, especially if care is taken to lure them into high-speed fights, where most opponents will lose their energy much more quickly than the P-63.
