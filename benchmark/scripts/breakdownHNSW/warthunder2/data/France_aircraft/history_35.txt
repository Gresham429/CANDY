History of M.B.157: 
Early development in 1934 by Société des Avions Marcel Bloch produced the Bloch M.B.150 single seat, all-metal low-wing monoplane fighter featuring a fully enclosed cockpit and retractable landing gear. While not initially chosen by the French Air Ministry for production, development continued on this aircraft. Following several setbacks and operational problems, a modified prototype was finally able to attain flight in 1937. Several additional modifications were necessary to refine this aircraft which included a more robust and strengthened wing and utilising the 14-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial Gnome-Rhône 14N-7 engine. During 1938 after running several trial runs, 25 preproduction aircraft were ordered.
