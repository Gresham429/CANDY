Description of F8F-1B_(France): 
Shortly after WWII, France was in dire need of relatively modern military equipment, since conflicts in their colonies started to become more and more violent. Many allied nations like the US and Great Britain supplied France with surplus military vehicles left after WWII, like M4 Shermans, Spitfires, and other vehicles. The F8F-1B Bearcat was one of these aircraft, designed with the lessons learned during the Battle of Midway, it was developed too late to enter WWII. 200 were sent to France; even though they were already obsolete for 1951, they were enough to deal with small groups of guerrilla fighters like the Viet Minh, because they did not have access to any kind of air force. The Bearcats were used only in close air support.
