Usage of Potez_633: 
The Potez 633's light bomb load (when compared to the Farman monsters that preceded it) makes this aircraft much more dependent on skill when dropping ordnance. When facing light vehicles, the 8x50kg load is particularly useful, allowing you to tag along with the larger bombers and clean up after their pass. Use the 7.5 mm MG in the nose to clean up any stray SPAA trucks in your path... A short burst will usually be rewarded with a kill. Use the bombs on anything else that moves.
