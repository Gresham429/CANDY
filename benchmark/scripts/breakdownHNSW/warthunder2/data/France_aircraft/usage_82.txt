Usage of Jaguar_A: 
The Jaguar A's only air-to-air missiles are locked as a rank 4 modification. The entirety of its opposition will be carrying both IR and semi-active radar missiles, although IR missiles will be the main source of induced headaches. Once these missiles are researched, the Jaguar becomes a force to be reckoned with, and it becomes possible to engage enemy aircraft who are preoccupied in a dogfight or happen to fly in front of you. The bomb/rocket load of the Jaguar A is decent, and bombing bases and key targets is definitely a good way to acquire Research Points and Silver Lions. Carrying a hybrid air-to-air and air-to-ground load is a good compromise, retaining adequate ground pounding capabilities while acquiring self-defence capabilities.
