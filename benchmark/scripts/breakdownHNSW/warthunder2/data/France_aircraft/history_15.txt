History of M.B.174A-3: 
Evolution of the MB.170, this new model definitively abandoned the belly turret and the crew's typical layout was revised. The cockpit and front-end glazing were again modified, however, the MB.170-02's tail was retained. Intended specifically for reconnaissance with a secondary bombing mission, the prototype took the air on 5 January 1939 in Villacoublay piloted by René Le Bail with 14M-20/21 Gnome & Rhône engines of 1,030 hp. Six pre-production aircraft were ordered to activate the development of the twin-engine aircraft, but this aircraft proved to be very fast and easy to fly from the first tests, manoeuvrable even at very high altitude and an order for 50 serial copies was notified on 1 February 1939. Intended to replace the Potez 63.11 of the war, they were to receive 14M-48/49 Gnome & Rhône engines of 1,100 hp, but the first tests carried out with the pre-series aircraft revealed cooling problems. It was, therefore, necessary to reduce the diameter of the propeller pans in order to increase the airflow on the cylinder heads. Finally, just before the commissioning it was decided to increase the armament, which was finally attached to two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wings and three mounted in removable ventral fairings pulling forward, a dorsal machine gun and a ventral weapon of the same type pulling backwards. The belly compartment allowed 400 kg of bombs to be carried, but in its initial version, its capacity was in fact limited to 8 x 40 kg bombs which was clearly insufficient in most operations. The production was launched in November 1939 at the SNCASO plant in Bordeaux-Mérignac, but because of the modifications made to the planes during their development the first 20 MB.174 were accepted by the air force only in February 1940 and put into service in March 1940 to the strategic reconnaissance group GR II/33. 56 copies were delivered until June 22, 1940. In operations, this twin-engine aircraft was able to outrun the best German fighters then in service and only 4 MB.174 were lost to the enemy during the Battle of France.
