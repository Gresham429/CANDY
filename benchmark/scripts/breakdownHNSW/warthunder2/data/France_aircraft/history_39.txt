History of M.B.162: 
The M.B.162 was derived from the original civilian airliner Bloch M.B. 160 already in service and was built as mail plane by the Société des Avions Marcel Bloch. Société des Avions Marcel Bloch was a French aircraft manufacturer of both military and civilian aircraft which changed its name to Dassault Aviation after the end of World War II. The company was originally founded by Marcel Bloch (hence "MB" in the aircraft designations) who, after the war changed his name to Marcel Dassault, the Bloch M.B. 162 shares very few common points with his civilian counterpart, especially concerning its wings[1]
