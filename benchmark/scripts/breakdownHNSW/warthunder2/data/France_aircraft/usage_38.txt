Usage of B-26C: 
Being essentially an upsized B-25, the B-26C Marauder excels at fast bombing using its speed to quickly reach a target. However, due to the Marauder being significantly larger, the plane has several limitations that prevents it from being played aggressively like its predecessor. As such, the playstyle of the B-26 is somewhat similar to other medium bombers: quickly approaching the target, drop the bomb, and then retreat.
