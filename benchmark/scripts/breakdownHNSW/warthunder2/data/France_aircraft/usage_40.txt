Usage of Yak-3_(France): 
The Yak-3 is the pinnacle of the piston engine Yakovlev design, with a much more powerful engine, the addition of a second MG (meaning the MGs are viable now!), though metal wings were not yet added until the Yak-9.  The coolant system, now actually somewhat effective, has been moved to the wing roots (no "smiley face" below the nose), making the plane more streamlined. The cannon - the same old 20 mm ShVak - receives a pleasant upgrade: very effective Air Targets belts.
