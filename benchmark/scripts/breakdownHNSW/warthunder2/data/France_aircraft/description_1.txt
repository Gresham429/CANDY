Description of D.371: 
Developed over the D.37 family of aircraft by SAF-Avions Dewoitine in the early 1930s, the D.371 was the first production version of this family, first flown in 1934 and powered by a Gnome Rhone 14Kfs engine. At the time, the aircraft used a single-seat aeroplane design with a parasol wing, a fixed landing gear and, like many other aircrafts of the time, it did not feature an enclosed cockpit and instead just had a windshield for the pilot. There are no records of the aircraft being used in combat due to its obsolence and the presence of more modern fighters at the start of World War II.
