Description of P-63C-5_(France): 
Most P-63s never saw use with the USAF, and instead were sent to Allied nations like the USSR. France operated a total of 114 aircraft ordered from the United States shortly before the end of WWII. These aircraft were mostly used against the Viet Minh in the French Indochina War of 1947, replacing the outdated Spitfires donated by the RAF. Since the Viet Minh lacked any kind of air force, France used the P-63s as ground attackers. For this, the aircraft was adapted to carry napalm bomb. However, the aircraft soon started to suffer from high casualties against Viet Minh AA guns, and with the arrival of surplus F6F, F8Fs, and F4Us, the P-63C was retired from service in Indochina.
