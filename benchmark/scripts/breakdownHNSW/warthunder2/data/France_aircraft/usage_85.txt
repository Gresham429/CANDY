Usage of Mirage_2000C-S5: 
The aircraft's weapons suite paired with its flight performance makes it a dangerous foe to any aircraft opposing it. The aircraft is a formidable foe in BVR engagements and even more so in a dogfight. This versatility offered by its great weapons and flight performance means that it can perform as a support fighter, slinging its Super 530D's from afar and at high altitudes. Thanks to its flight performance, it can also comfortably perform well as a frontline fighter, diving straight in to fire its Super 530D and excellent all-aspect IR R550 Magic 2 missiles. However, pilots of the Mirage 2000 will have to be careful of when they fire their missiles as it carries only 4 missiles in total, which is little compared to a lot of its competition. In addition, missiles such as the AIM-7F Sparrow, carried by some American fighters, possess a higher effective range than the Super 530D missile. Therefore, the Mirage 2000 pilots are advised to stay out of the range in which a longer-range missile can strike the Mirage, while being too far for the Mirage's Super 530D to strike back.
