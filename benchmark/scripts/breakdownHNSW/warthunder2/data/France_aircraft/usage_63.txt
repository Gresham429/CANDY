Usage of F-86K_(France): 
The F-86K should be used mainly as a support fighter, due to its sub-par maneuverability compared to other aircraft at its rank such as the MiG-17 at low speeds. In a 1 vs 1 dogfight, the F-86K is outclassed when pitted against a MiG-17 unless you fight in a vertical, which this aircraft should do most of the time. When it comes to bomber hunting, this aircraft has four M24A1s, however these are also fantastic to use during a head-on attack. However, don't commit to head ons, instead fire a burst from around .8 km away, then pull out. This is to decrease the chances of both of you crashing into the enemy and increasing your chance of survival. Your opponents will mainly be slightly lower-ranked aircraft like the MiG-15 Bis or F-86 A5 Sabre which you can easily out climb or outrun. However, sometimes you will get up-tiered to a higher rank and unfortunately, any thrust advantage is nullified when facing F-100s which are supersonic aircraft. There is a potential to be matched up against Hunter F.6s which can be armed with the devastating SRAAM missiles.
