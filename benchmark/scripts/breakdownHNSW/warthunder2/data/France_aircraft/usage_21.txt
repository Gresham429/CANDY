Usage of V.G.33C-1: 
The V.G.33C-1 is a very competitive aircraft at its battle rating, with decent climb rate, good speed and good manoeuvrability. Its biggest weaknesses are its lack of ammunition and lack of armour. To take advantage of this plane, it's best to side climb and exploit any opportunities that will present themselves. Both turnfighting and BnZ tactics work well with this plane but turnfighting is the better of the two due to the lack of ammo, it also allows for, generally speaking, a better and cleaner shot. Trigger control is key when flying this plane. Though not as manoeuvrable as a spitfire, it can sustain a turnfight with an F6F, Yak-7 or Yak-9, but against a fighter like a I-16, you can use your high horsepower engine in a steep climb while dodging out of the way of its guns, to stall it out so you can finish him off with your 7.5 mm MGs.
