Usage of C.R.714: 
The C.R.714's racing heritage heavily influences the playstyle for this aircraft: Boom and Zoom. Spend the first portion of the match climbing to altitude, then locate a suitable target and dive on them. However, it would be a wise choice to prioritize slower, bulkier targets as the plane's ailerons will make it impossible to change course at high speeds. Simply dive in, fire a burst, then climb out. If the enemy manoeuvres to prevent you from shooting them, simply pull up and disengage back to a higher altitude. Don't over-engage as it will mean that you will lose your speed advantage, and potentially force you into a turn fight. Do not engage in a turn fight. Most of all of other fighters you will face will have a tighter turning radius and will easily find themselves right behind you.
