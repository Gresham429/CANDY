Usage of M.B.157: 
The M.B.157 has good energy retention and does well with Boom & Zoom tactics. While turn-fighting is not recommended as typically as it will leave you with low energy and a slow plane, if needed, you can utilize combat flaps and rudder to help make sharper turns when chasing down other aircraft or trying to dodge enemy aircraft fire. The .157 is an aircraft which can excel when it has an energy advantage over the enemy and to do so needs to side-climb on the map in order to get to a decent altitude. For this fighter, speed is key and having enough room to dive and zoom away will extend the pilot's ability to survive and line up another shot.
