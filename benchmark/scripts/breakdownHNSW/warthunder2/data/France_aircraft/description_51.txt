Description of Lancaster_MR.7: 
After World War II, many Lancaster bombers were refitted into civilian roles, such as transport, mail delivery, and search and rescue. 59 Lancaster B.Is and B.VIIs were ordered by the French AÃ©ronavale to be converted into a maritime patrol aircraft. The aircraft, later designated Lancaster MR.7, were delivered by Avro during 1952-53. These would be the last direct variant of the Lancaster ever built. The MR.7 flew until the mid-1960s by four squadrons stationed in France and New Caledonia in the maritime reconnaissance and search-and-rescue roles.
