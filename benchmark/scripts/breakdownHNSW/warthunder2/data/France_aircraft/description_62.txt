Description of Super_Mystere_B2: 
The French Super Mystère B2 was designed, developed and manufactured by Dassault Aviation as a multi-role fighter-bomber, a new niche which would later encompass such aircraft as the F-105 Thunderchief and the F-4C Phantom which could not be pigeon-holed into one type of combat role. The multi-role function created a combat multiplier with just one aircraft instead of needing several specialized aircraft to do certain jobs. A last-minute change of targets could allow for weapons change or multiple types of ordnance can be carried to take on one or more roles during a combat run. The Super Mystère was the culminating aircraft in a series of four other predecessors before it. Initially starting with the Dassault Ouragan, modifications and upgrades led to the Mystère II, Mystère III and Mystère IV. The Mystère series fighters, while quick, could not reach supersonic speeds except during a dive whereas, like many of the newer aircraft of the time, the Super Mystère had swept wings which allowed it to achieve supersonic flight during level flight. The Super Mystere B2 was France's first aircraft capable of reaching supersonic speeds in level flight, which meant that it also was very attractive to other nations in the weapons market. It was exported to Israel, El Salvador and Honduras, and it helped solidify France as a major weapons producer.
