History of Mystere_IVA: 
The Dassault MD.454 Myst√®re IV was developed in the 1950s, as France's first transonic fighter in service. The aircraft had a very similar appearence to other Dassualt designs of the time, like the Ouragan, Mystere II and the Mystere III, however the Mystere IV was a newer design, much more improved over its predecessors, that solidified France as a major weapons manufacturer in the global market.
