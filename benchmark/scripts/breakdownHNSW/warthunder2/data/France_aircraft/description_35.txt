Description of M.B.157: 
The Bloch M.B.150 series was a single seat, all-metal low-wing monoplane fighter featuring a fully enclosed cockpit and retractable landing gear, a very revolutionary design for the French Air Force at the time of its development in 1934. The development was hampered by operational problems during its development. In 1938, 25 preproduction aircraft were ordered. With further testing, improved versions like the 151 and 152 entered service at the outbreak of WWII, powered by 920 hp and 1,050 hp engines respectively. The M.B.157 was a prototype further development of the M.B.152, featuring an even more powerful 1,590 hp engine; however, only one prototype was built and it never saw service.
