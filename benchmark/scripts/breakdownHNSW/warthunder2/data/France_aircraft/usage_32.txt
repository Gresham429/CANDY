Usage of M.B.152C1: 
As stated before, the Bloch can fit into any combat style the pilot can put it in, with the exception of Boom-&-Zoom, and even in that role, it is decent. The main tactic one should use is energy dogfighting, a mix of energy fighting and dogfighting. Attempt to gain altitude, preferably 4,000 meters, then search for a low flying target. Once you find your prey, examine their energy state and potential energy, determine whether the plane they are flying is superior to yours, then you can choose if you can engage or not. During an engagement, do not let the opponent lock you into rolling manoeuvres, such as the rolling scissors, as the Bloch's roll rate is mediocre at best.
