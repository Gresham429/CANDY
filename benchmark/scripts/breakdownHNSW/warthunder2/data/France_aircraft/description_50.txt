Description of PB4Y-2_(France): 
The â–„PB4Y-2 Privateer was given to France under the MDA (Mutual Defense Assistance Act) which was signed in 1949. A few years later, France would receive 22 PB4Ys and would use them in Vietnam during the first Indochina War as bombers. They served in the theater until the Battle of Dien Bien Phu which was a decisive loss for France. Six of these PB4Ys were sent back to America while the rest were shipped to North Africa to fight in Algeria and then during the Suez Crisis. In the early 1960s, the PB4Ys were scrapped.
