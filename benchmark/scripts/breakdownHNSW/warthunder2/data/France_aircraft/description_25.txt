Description of F6F-5_(France): 
After World War II, France found itself lacking a proper military to maintain the domain of its overseas colonies like French Indochina. The F6F Hellcat was chosen by the French AÃ©ronavale to be its new multirole aircraft, the aircraft served alongside F4U Corsairs and F8F Bearcats later on. Around 150 units were acquired between 1950 and 1953. The F6F had a short service life due to its relative obsolescence, most units were withdrawn from service with the introduction of the Bearcat, but the aircraft remained as a solid close air support choice during the Indochina Wars.
