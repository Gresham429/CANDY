Description of Etendard_IVM: 
Following a collaborative effort between Dassault Aviation and Breguet Aviation in the late 1950s to develop a new strike fighter meeting the requirements of the French Navy, the Etendard IVM entered service in 1962. The aircraft boasted a delta wing configuration and was equipped with a single SNECMA Atar 8 engine, affording it respectable speed and range. The Etendard IV played a notable role during the Cold War era as a carrier-based platform, carrying a variety of munitions, including air-to-surface missiles and anti-ship weapons. Despite its service longevity, the Etendard IVM gradually succumbed to obsolescence, with its final retirement from active duty occurring in the early 2000s, marking the end of an era for this stalwart of French naval aviation.
