Usage of M.S.410: 
The M.S.410 is a respectably balanced fighter, able to both turn and energy fight with reasonable performance in both roles. The typical French combo of 7.5 mm MGs and 20 mm Hispano cannon though the spinner allows you to take on even the toughest of targets at your rank with little issue in landing hard-hitting knock-outs.
