History of SB2C-5_(France): 
The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver was a dive-bomber that entered service with the US Navy in 1942, replacing the earlier SBD Dauntless. A much larger aircraft than the Dauntless, it was powered by the R-2600 Twin Cyclone engine and featured an internal bomb bay. The Helldiver experienced difficulties during development and was initially unpopular with its crews. It had a shorter range than the Dauntless, was difficult to maintain, and had worse handling characteristics, earning it some colorful nicknames like "Big-tailed Beast" or "Son of a ***** 2nd Class". The design was progressively improved and the SB2C served extensively in the Pacific, participating in the sinking of the Japanese battleship Yamato and other storied campaigns. The US Navy continued to use the SB2C after the end of World War II for a few years, but the concept of the dive bomber had become outdated due to the advent of powerful air-to-ground rockets, guided weapons, and other technological advances. Even during the war, the Helldiver's role was often taken over by fighter-bombers like the F6F Hellcat. The Helldiver was retired in 1947 and a number were sold to other countries.
