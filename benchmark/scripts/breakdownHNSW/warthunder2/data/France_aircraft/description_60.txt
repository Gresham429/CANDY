Description of F-84G-26-RE_(France): 
Republic Aircraft Company's jump into the jet fighter market was not as smooth as they would have liked. They experienced severe growing pains as they developed and produced the F-84 series aircraft, especially the B, C, D and E variants. Important upgrades and modifications included a more powerful turbine engine, strengthened wings, aerodynamically secure wing-tip fuel tanks and a strengthened structure. The result of these upgrades was the much improved F-84G fighter, which boasted new innovations such as improved avionics, radar, the capability of in-flight refuelling and ability to carry a Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Though the operationally longest lasting of the series with the United States (into the mid-1960s), several other nations continued to use it including Taiwan (Republic of China) and Italy, however, Greece continued flying their fighters until 1991.[1] France operated a total of 140 F-84s of the E and G variants, purchased in the mid-1950s, as France at the time was facing conflicts in many of their overseas domains, while not having a modern close air support aircraft like the F-84.
