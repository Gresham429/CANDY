Usage of F8F-1B_(France): 
In Arcade battles the F8F-1B can perform at its prime, which is, accordingly, remarkably. Due to the lack of damage due to overheating and such, the F8F-1B can easily outstrip any piston-engined fighter in a climb once upgraded. Prior to the engine-injection upgrade, the 1B performs very well, but not as sublimely as it does with the latter modification. Thus, climbing and BnZ match perfectly with the F8F-1B in AB due to its astounding climb rate, speed, acceleration, and weaponry.
