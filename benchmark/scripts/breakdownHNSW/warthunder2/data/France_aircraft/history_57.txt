History of M.D.452_IIA: 
The M.D.452 Mystere was a swept-wing air superiority fighter developed by Dassault Aviation, derived from the M.D.450 Ouragan. The aircraft combined the fuselage of the Ouragan with a new swept-wing, enabling it to reach much faster speeds than its predecessor. In 1951, the Mystere IIA became the first French-designed plane to break the sound barrier, in a controlled dive.[1] Later on, the aircraft would enter service with the French Air force, and serve until 1957, when it was relegated to training duties.
