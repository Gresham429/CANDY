History of B-26C: 
After the conclusion of Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of North Africa) in November 1942, the United States supplied the Free French Air Forces with a batch of B-26C Marauders to replace the now obsolete Lior√© et Olivier LeO 451s and Douglas DB-7s. These B-26s were prominently used during the invasion of Italy and southern France. At the end of the war, seven out of nine of the Free French's bomber squadrons used the Marauder, taking part in 270 missions and 4,884 sorties. The Marauder were decommissioned from French service in July 1945, though some of them were retained as trainers and test beds, including one that was converted to test SNECMA ATAR jet engines.
