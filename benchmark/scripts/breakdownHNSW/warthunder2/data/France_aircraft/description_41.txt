Description of P-47D-22-RE_(France): 
The ▄P-47D-22-RE Thunderbolt was one of the aircraft received by the Free French Air Force during the later stages of World War II as part of their lend-lease program. These aircraft were provided to strengthen the French forces and offer them opportunities to contribute to the war effort. This particular aircraft, bearing the tail number 226157 (42-26157), was the 619th P-47D-22-RE built, and belonged to the GC II/3 "Dauphiné". Unfortunately, due to limited information available about its whereabouts during and after the war, its history has largely been lost, with only a few artistic drawings and photos serving as proof of its existence.
