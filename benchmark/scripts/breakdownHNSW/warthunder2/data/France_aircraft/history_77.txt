History of Mirage_F1C: 
In the early 1960s, Dassault Aviation was conducting intense design studies on the basis of the Mirage, resulting in a number of different variations of the aircraft emerging. Among them, a smaller swept wing design of the Mirage outfitted with the latest and more powerful SNECMA Atar 9K-50 turbojet engine garnered the interest of Dassault engineers as a possible future replacement to the existing Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighters.
