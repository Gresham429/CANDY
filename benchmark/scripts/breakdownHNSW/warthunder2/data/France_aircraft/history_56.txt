History of M.D.450B_Barougan: 
The prevalence of makeshift airfields created a need for jet aircraft that could comfortably take off and land on them. The Ouragan, which was relegated to properly developed runways, was selected by Dassault to pursue this need. Serial number 140 was selected to experiment with the use of a new gear that would be able to meet this requirement. Instead of the normal three-wheel landing gear, the plane was fitted with a normal nose gear and four "low pressure" wheels in the center. A tail parachute was also fitted to help reduce the landing distance. The Barougan as it would be called (which stands for battle in Arabic), was able to take off from grass airfields and was a decent competitor to SNCASE's Barouder. Unfortunately, budget cuts ended the program and the Barougan was reconverted back to its normal Ouragan configuration.
