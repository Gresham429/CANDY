Usage of Potez_631: 
The Potez 631 is best used as a mid- to low-altitude energy fighter. The sluggish climb, poor performance above 16,000 feet and vulnerability to frontal damage limit its effectiveness as a higher-altitude interceptor, while the stability and surprising manoeuvrability at high speeds make it ideal for diving on vulnerable targets at low altitudes and then extending away to begin the slow climb to set up for another pass. If you attract the attention of an enemy fighter, do not attempt to climb away or to execute any advanced manoeuvres such as loops or chandelles, as the Potez 631 bleeds energy at an exceptional rate in any kind of a climb. Just stay level with the throttle wide open and let the dorsal gunner ward off trailing attackers until you can safely begin a shallow climb to set up for re-engagement. Pilots with solid gunnery skills who can accurately gauge convergence distance can excel in this aircraft with six converged guns and two centreline cannons delivering a high volume of lethal ordnance to a small targeted area.
