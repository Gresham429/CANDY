History of D.373: 
In the early 1930s, SAF-Avions Dewoitine, a French aircraft manufacturing company developed the D.37 aircraft, a single-seat aeroplane with a parasol wing, radial engine, fixed landing gear and a tail-skid; however, the actual manufacturing of the aircraft was transferred to Lior√© et Olivier. The cockpit did not have an enclosed canopy; just a windscreen forward of the pilot.
