Usage of Super_Mystere_B2: 
The Dassault Super Mystere B2 is the result of many years of research and development, specifically learning lessons from earlier Myst√®re fighters. The result is a well-rounded fighter/interceptor/bomber aircraft which will have no problems finding a role on any map to maximize its potential. Suspended weapon options for this aircraft give it the potential for air-to-air combat, ground-attack combat or even a complementary mix of both types of weapons to go after targets of opportunity both in the air and on the ground. Though not a glamorous and well-known fighter such as those from other nations, the Super Mystere B2 can be a diamond in the rough which can sneak its way up the leader board racking up destroyed aircraft, ground targets and even enemy bases.
