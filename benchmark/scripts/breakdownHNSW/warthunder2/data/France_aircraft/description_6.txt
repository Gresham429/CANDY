Description of D.500: 
The D.500 was the replacement for the NiD-62 fighters that were still in operational service with France in the early 1930s. The French Air Ministry issued a new order for a fighter capable of replacing the aging NiD-62, an all-metal interceptor was developed, becoming the D.500. The aircraft was adopted in 1935, and it was a very competent fighter for its time, but it was quickly surpassed by superior designs such as the M.S.406. The aircraft never saw combat in the Battle of France, and was directly succeeded by the D.520.
