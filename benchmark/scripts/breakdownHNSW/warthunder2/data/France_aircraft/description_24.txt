Description of Potez_631: 
The SNCAN Potez 631 was the second production variant of the Potez 63 project, which was a project intended to provide France with modern heavy fighter capabilities and which eventually led to one of the most prolific and versatile series of combat aircraft to be built by the French aeronautical industry at the beginning of World War II. The 63 series, originally conceived in 1934, yielded not only strategic fighters but also light bombers as well as attack and reconnaissance planes, resulting in the production of more than 1,100 aircraft of different variants in the series by June 1940. This elegant aircraft remained in active service during the German occupation, and approximately 250 additional planes built in that period were used by the Luftwaffe as transport and liaison aircraft of the Vichy Air Force, the Italian Regia Aeronautica, and of the Romanian Air Force.
