Usage of Mirage_F1C-200: 
The best phrase that describes this plane would be aggressively mediocre. It lacks a strong suit and is essentially incapable of using its radar missiles in matches at a BR where almost everyone has access to some form of SARH or ARH air-to-air missiles. This may lead to some frustrations as the lack of radar missiles and middle-of-the-pack flight performance are going up against the best fighters the game has to offer, but the F1C will still pull through with some effort.
