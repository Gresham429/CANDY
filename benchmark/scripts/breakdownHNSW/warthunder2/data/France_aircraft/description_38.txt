Description of B-26C: 
The B-26 Marauder was a medium bomber, designed to be used both for high altitude bombing but to also provide close air support to Allied troops if necessary. France acquired a number of B-26C Marauders after Operation Torch in 1942, replacing the LeO 451s and Douglas DB-7s. They were used in the Allied invasions of Italy and southern France. After the war, most of them were retired, but some stayed for training and testing; one was even converted to test the early SNECMA ATAR jet engines.
