Usage of A-35B_(France): 
The A-35B is designed as a ground attack aircraft, and should be played as such. The aircraft is relatively slow, rather large, and not particularly manoeuvrable. Thus, play the aircraft like a ground attacker. However, it does have some perks which should be utilized to the maximum.
