Description of VB.10-02: 
Originally conceived as a single engine fighter-interceptor in 1937, development of the Arsenal VB.10 was halted following the German invasion of France in 1940. By the time of the liberation of France in 1944, progress in aircraft development has rendered the original VB.10 obsolete. As such, the design underwent major overhaul to keep up with advancing technology, most notably the addition of second engine behind the pilot's seat to power another set of contra-propellers to give the plane more thrust. The second prototype, designated VB.10-02, first flew after the war in September 1946. It features an increase in armament in the form of six .50 cal Browning machine guns to reinforce the already heavy armament of four Hispano autocannons. Unfortunately, the VB.10 suffered from fatal flaws of engine cooling and overheating problem, which results into the second prototype being destroyed by in-flight fire on January 1948. The advent of jet fighters and another hull loss resulted into the cancellation of the project in September that year.
