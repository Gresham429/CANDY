History of D.520: 
Widely regarded as the best fighter of French origin to emerge during World War 2, the Dewoitine D.520's combat carrier had two main phases. After the fall of France, large numbers of the type were sent to Africa and some took part in the 1941 Syrian campaign against the British and Free French forces. Fighting alongside the German Luftwaffe, the D.520's pilots were involved in the fight against the Allies during the Operation Torch landings in November, 1942. After the victory of the Allies, a large number of D.520 pilots decided to change sides and fight for the Allies. The type was extensively used by Luftwaffe fighter schools as trainers, this shows the desperation faced by that service late in the war. Accident rates among students were very high.
