Description of N.C.223.3: 
The N.C.223.3, as a derivative of the Farman F.220 plane model, looks strikingly similar to the F.222.2 bomber, yet different as well. The biggest difference in the design was the twin rudder on the tail that helped improve stability and yaw control. The plane's overall design was also made more aerodynamic as part of the improvement, the nose section was made shorter, and the plane introduced improved Hispano-Suiza 12Y-29 engines that replaced the previous Gnome Rhone model engines. Defensive armaments were also improved with two Hispano cannons as the rear ventral and dorsal turret armament. In 1940, with the capitulation of France, these bombers were transferred to North Africa to work as transport aircraft, to later be replaced by other cargo aircraft, such as the C-47 Skytrain.
