History of M.S.406C1: 
The first modern fighter of WW2 France, and their most famous combat plane. A first-class aircraft, it was only inferior in performance in French pre-war service to the D.520. A total of 1,081 were built, more than any other French plane except the Potez 63. The prototype (the in-game M.S. 405) first flew in August 1935, becoming the first French fighter to break the 400 km/h limit. In 1937, it was advertised at the Brussels Air Show as "the best fighter plane in the world." The fourth prototype would be taken into production as the M.S. 406, with 600 aircraft in 12 units at the start of the war, having been taken into operational service in December 1938. During the war, the M.S. 406 proved a fair match for the German Bf. 109: 150 M.S. 406s were shot down in the Battle for France, against 191 confirmed and 89 probable kills by the same make of aircraft. Another hundred were destroyed on the ground. Finland also purchased 40 before the war.
