Usage of Seafire_LF_Mk.III_(France): 
The Seafire LF Mk.III is a jack of all trades, but master of none. The Seafire does not climb well, so after start of battle, pilots should side climb, stay at around 3,000 m of altitude and let better climbing teammates tackle the first wave of enemy interceptors, trying to pick off those that managed to dive down. Still retaining great turning capabilities, the pilot is advised to force enemies into turnfighting where they bleed their energy and become vulnerable. Avoid head-ons at all cost due to the very fragile radiator and engine: even a single bullet will take it out.
