Usage of Milan: 
Your only chance to get kills in the Milan is to always stay on top of the battlefield and kill enemies from behind. The Milan can still be considered as a decent bomber for ground RB, having access to CCIP and CCRP you can hunt down any tanks. However, the Ã‰tendard does an infinitely better job at that.
