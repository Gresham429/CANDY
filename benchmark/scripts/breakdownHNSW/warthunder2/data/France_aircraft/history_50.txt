History of PB4Y-2_(France): 
After WWII and at the dawn of the Cold War, in view of rearming NATO allies, the United States passed the Mutual Defense Assistance Act where they would provide equipment to allies; France was one of those nations. 22 PB4Y-2s were supplied to the AÃ©ronavale (French naval air arm) and were first used during the First Indochina War to suppress the North Vietnamese forces until the tide of war turned against the French; 4 of these bombers were lost during this 8-year war.
