Usage of Etendard_IVM: 
Although it does not have an afterburner, the Etendard has a very competitive TWR and acceleration, thanks to its light weight and powerful engine. It also has a good climb rate, decent turn rate, and a fairly standard set of armaments. However, like many French jets at its rank, it tends to have poor energy retention, and any manoeuvring tends to drastically reduce acceleration. This means that a turnfighting playstyle is often difficult, and defensive flying is hard to do successfully- the player should avoid gaining a tail if at all possible.
