History of Mirage_2000D-R1: 
The Mirage 2000D (Diversifi√©, "multi-role") is the attack variant of the Mirage 2000. Originally developed from the 2000N, the 2000D received many attack aircraft features while also retaining some aspects of the later 2000C (Thomson RDI radar and SNECMA M53-P2 engine). The 2000D featured an NVG-compatible cockpit (AN/AVS-9 NVG), better HOTAS, more screens for the pilot and back-seater, Antilope 50 terrain-following system, ICMS 2 countermeasure system, GPS, SERVAL RWR, Chameleon jammer, and Spirale dispensers mounted in the rear of the Karman fairings. In addition to the new avionics, the 2000D could carry all dumb munitions, laser-guided weapons, and the Armat anti-radar missile.
