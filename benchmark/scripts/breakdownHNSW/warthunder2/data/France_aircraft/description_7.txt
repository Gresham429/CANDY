Description of D.501: 
The D.501 was a subvariant of the D.500 series of aircraft developed by the French Air Ministry in the early 1930s. The D.501 used a different powerplant and armament compared to the D.500, instead of the regular Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs engine, it used the 12Xcrs, that allowed mounting a more powerful armament, in the form of a 20 mm cannon as well as a couple of machine guns. For the time of its introduction, autocannons were very rare in regular fighters, since most used a pair of light machine guns, as such the armament could be considered one of the best for its time. A total of 160 D.501s were produced by the time of WWII, with a very limited service in the front line.
