Usage of M.B.162: 
The M.B.162 is a heavy bomber, and therefore should be flown as such. When you start a match, you will want to climb to 6-7 km in altitude to protect yourself from German and Italian fighters that will climb to intercept you. With both of the payload options, all bombs are needed to destroy a bombing base. It is worthy to note that the M.B.162 can be significantly more aggressive in Arcade, where its already excellent performance is boosted to further levels.
