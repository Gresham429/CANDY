Usage of Potez_630: 
The Potez 630 was developed to be a multi-role aircraft capable of control/direction, interception/bomber escorting and night fighting, however, it never really measured up to what was expected. This aircraft was originally outfitted with Hispano-Suiza engines (which the current 630 in the game utilises), however, due to problems and poor performance, the French later changed these engines out for Gnome-Rhone 14-cylinder radials. The Potez 630 in the game utilises the weaker Hispano-Suiza engines which in-turn explains why this aircraft has a poor climb rate and energy retention problems.
