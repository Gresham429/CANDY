Usage of M.B.174A-3: 
With its heaviest and most effective bombload being a single 500 kg bomb held by bomb locks, the M.B.174 can effectively dive bomb. The recommended strategy is basically to dive on targets to secure a kill with a low number of high-weight bombs; a playstyle similar to the Ju 87 B-2 or the TBF-1C. The only limitation to this strategy is that you cannot drop bombs while making a diving turn due to your twin-engine configuration. However, considering those engines provide you with a near-unmatched speed this is a worthwhile tradeoff.
