History of Ho-Ro: 
The Type 4 Ho-Ro was a Self Propelled Gun developed by the Imperial Japanese Army, based off the German Grille series. It was developed off the Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis and used a 150 mm Krupp gun, considered outdated by 1942. It was used to combat American forces. Only a few were made, and out of those few, 8 were sunk with a Japanese ship somewhere in the Pacific. Usually deployed in groups of 4, it was used in the Philippines during late 1944 and then used in ones and twos on Okinawa, to a somewhat great effect. It was ineffective due to its 3 degrees of gun swing and 30 degrees of depression because of the gun mount's design. That gave it a small firing distance of 6,000 m. It also could only fire 5 shells per minute because of the breech-loader.
