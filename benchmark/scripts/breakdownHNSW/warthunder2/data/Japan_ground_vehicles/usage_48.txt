Usage of STB-2: 
The STB-2 can be compared to the Leopard I or even a stock Leopard A1A1, but has its own capabilities in its own right. The STB-2 allows for both a more held down playstyle or aggressive playstyle versus the Leopard I due to its hydropneumatic suspension and two-plane stabilizer. Together with the power of the engine outfitted on the STB-2, allows it to speedily move to a nice sniper spot or hull-down position and fire at targets before they realize a tank could be there.
