History of Type_99: 
The previous Type 75 self-propelled 155 mm howitzer, which was formalized in 1975, has a maximum range of only 19 km even when using specially developed long-range ammo. On the other hand, the towed 155 mm howitzer FH-70 (jointly developed by Britain, West Germany and Italy), which began licensed production in 1983, has a maximum range of 30 km when using base-bleed ammunition. Even the French-made 120 mm towed mortar RT, which is deployed in infantry units, reaches a maximum range of 13 km when using rocket-assisted propellant. Maximum range stands as one of the most pivotal characteristics of artillery; thus, the maximum range of the Type 75 self-propelled howitzer fell short of contemporary standards, irrespective of its developmental era.
