Description of STB-2: 
The STB-2 is the prototype of the Type 74, which was developed shortly after the introduction of the Type 61. Due to Japan's late entry into post-war tank development, they were behind by one tank generation and had to compare their Type 61s to more advanced tanks such as the T-62s, M60s and Leopard 1s. To keep up with these advancements, Japan sought to upgrade their tanks with the primary goal of incorporating the new standard L7 rifled cannon.
