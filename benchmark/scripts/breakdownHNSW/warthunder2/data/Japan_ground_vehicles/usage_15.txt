Usage of Chi-He: 
As the successor of the Chi-Ha, the Chi-He has a redesigned hull with thicker armour, a more powerful engine and an up-armoured turret from the Chi-Ha Kai, so the front is overall at 50 mm effective. This will result in a very similar playstyle as the Chi-Ha Kai with the added benefits of being an upgrade.
