Description of Ho-Ni_III: 
The Type 3 Ho-Ni III (三式砲戦車「ホニIII」) was a tank destroyer developed by Japan during World War II. It was equipped with a Type 3 75 mm tank gun, which had a high muzzle velocity and could penetrate the armour of US tanks. Unlike its predecessors, the Ho-Ni III had a fully enclosed and armoured casemate that provided protection to the crew from ground and aerial threats. The vehicle was designed to supplement the newer Type 3 Chi-Nu tanks by converting the obsolete Type 97 Chi-Ha hulls into self-propelled guns. The production of the Ho-Ni III started in 1944, but only 31 units were completed due to material shortages and bombing. Most of these vehicles were stationed in the Japanese home islands and never saw combat.
