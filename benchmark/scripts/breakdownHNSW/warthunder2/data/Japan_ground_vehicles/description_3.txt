Description of Ka-Mi: 
The Special Type 2 Ka-Mi (特二式内火艇「カミ」) was a special type light tank built by the Japanese Navy for naval landing operations. Primarily based on the Ha-Go tank, the Ka-Mi was majorly modified to be a water-tight hull allowing it to float in the water, with add-on pontoons to improve high sea traversability.
