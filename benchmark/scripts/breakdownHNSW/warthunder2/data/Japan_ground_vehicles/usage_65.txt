Usage of Type_93: 
One of the main advantages of this vehicle is the speed, your main goal will be not on the front lines but behind offering support or flanking to intercept air targets. With a range of 6 km in any aspect you will need to move closer to the enemy than would be ideal for a vehicle like this. This vehicle is ideal for taking wide flanks through less trafficked parts of the map to get into position to lay ambushes for enemy air. While waiting for enemy air targets to spawn, you can also scout ground targets for your team.
