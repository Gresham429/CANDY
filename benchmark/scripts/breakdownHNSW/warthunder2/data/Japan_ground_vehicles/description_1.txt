Description of Ha-Go: 
The Type 95 Ha-Go (九五式軽戦車「ハ号」) was developed in response to the limitations of the Type 89 I-Go, which became evident as it could not keep pace with motorized infantry moving at 40 km/h. Consequently, it failed to fulfil its role as a "light tank," as it had to cover long distances separately by train, akin to other heavy equipment. The primary goal was to ensure that the new tank could match the speed of motorized infantry, facilitating their combined mobility. By 1935, when the design was finalized, the Ha-Go would assume the role of the Army's primary tank until the development of the Chi-Ha. Due to its lightweight and cost-effective design, the Ha-Go became Japan's most numerous tank built during the war.
