Usage of SUB-I-II: 
When hunting for planes, the SUB-I-II should always have some sort of cover to hide behind in case a plane retaliates. When shooting, you should also be mindful of the gun overheating and use all of the rounds in the belt as the SUB-I-II has only 800 rounds at most. If possible, try to remain near a friendly capture point to restock on ammo belts when they run out because the main cannon can shoot at 800 rpm.
