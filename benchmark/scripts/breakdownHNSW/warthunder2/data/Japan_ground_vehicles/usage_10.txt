Usage of Ta-Se: 
The Ta-Se is a fast turreted SPAAG armed with a 20 mm autocannon. It can serve both as an AA or, in urban/small maps, as a close-quarter flanking vehicle. With a fair 24 hp/ton ratio (fully upgraded), the Ta-Se has enough mobility to follow other light tanks. Its light weight makes breaking through obstacles a bit challenging, but, its canon can break most of them before making contact. With fairly narrow tracks, this vehicle is easily slowed down by rough terrain.
