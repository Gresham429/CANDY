History of Heavy_Tank_No.6_(Japan): 
The Tiger I heavy tank was arguably the most infamous tank of World War II. The design for this tank began as early as January 1937 when Henschel & Sohn worked on a large "breakthrough" called the Durchbruchwagen that weighed about 30 tons on request by the German military.[1] The request was modified over time for more armour and better gun that increased the weight to 36 tons, but this project was dropped in 1938 in favor of the better prototypes VK 30.01(H) and VK 36.01(H). These new prototypes were the start of the usage of the Schachtellaufwerk wheel arrangements, but these also never passed prototype stages and were both cancelled in 1942.
