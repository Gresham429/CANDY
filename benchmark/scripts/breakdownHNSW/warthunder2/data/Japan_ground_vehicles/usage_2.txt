Usage of Ke-Ni: 
Being a light tank, the Ke-Ni cannot engage enemies head-on. To succeed in an assault, you need to be sneaky. Flanking, avoiding the enemy and going behind them is your best option. The 37 mm gun can penetrate most Rank I tanks if you hit their weak spots, though it may take a few shots to destroy an enemy. Your first shot should be to take out the enemy gunner so they can't retaliate. After that, take out their driver so they can't retreat. Never linger in an open field since anything can kill you with ease. Use your good gun depression to keep a hull-down position behind hills and just pop out to shoot. Hide in bushes or behind buildings or rocks. You are quite small, so use this to your advantage.
