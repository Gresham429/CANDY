Usage of Type_81_(C): 
The Type 81 (C) is a missile launcher mounted on an Isuzu truck that best operates from a safe distance away from the frontlines. It is not designed for any heated battlefield where shells and bullets fly, especially due to its nature of being a SPAA based on a Isuzu logistics truck. It is never a good idea to drive straight into the battlefield in a truck with non-existing protection; the rule of thumb for Tan-SAM Kai is fairly simple - don't get spotted until air threats begin to appear.
