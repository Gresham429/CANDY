Usage of Type_74_(G): 
The Type 74 (G) is a classic MBT with good mobility and firepower. It's fast enough to be somewhat competitive with its peers (although low-speed acceleration and manoeuvrability are lacking, which makes urban fighting sometimes tedious), and can sometimes reach favourable early-game positions before the enemy. The Type 74 (G) is slower than the AMX-30 Super, OF-40 (MTCA), and most IFVs, so watch out for those tanks in situations where mobility is required.  The Type 74 (G)'s reverse speed is mediocre, so peeking an enemy in order to take a shot can be dangerous; the enemy may have time to fire back before the Type 74 (G) can retreat into cover. All in all, this tank has good mobility, but it can't be depended on in a pinch, and it certainly doesn't give the Type 74 (G) a significant advantage over the enemy.
