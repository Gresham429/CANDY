Usage of Type_75_MLRS: 
The Type 75 MLRS is best played as a support vehicle. It can be used to sneak up on the enemy from a distance and destroying them with a few rockets. The rockets detonate on contact, so beware of bushes, trees and other obstacles. The chance of missing is quite high, so it will require multiple rockets. When a teammate is in danger, you can use your rockets to effectively suppress the enemy. Try to shoot your rockets between the turret and the hull like a HE shell, causing either the enemy ammunition to explode or knocking out the entire crew by overpressure. The side armour is thin enough, that APHE shells won't detonate inside your tank and will just go through. When a tank destroyer with thick frontal armour appears frontally, try to shoot at the commander's cupola or the ground under the belly armour. Having an almost non-existent reload between rockets is a huge advantage over other vehicles. The biggest disadvantage is the non-existent gun depression.
