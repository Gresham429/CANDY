Usage of Chi-Ri_II: 
The best play style with the Chi-Ri II is a conservative one, a strategy equally applicable to its predecessor the Chi-To. One should lay a far distance from the enemy, using the high-velocity 75 mm gun in a sniping role than a close support. When an enemy appears, fire upon them, and the auto-loader allows for some mistakes as the next burst round is available in about a second for a follow-up shot. Once the three shots are expended, one has the option of either retreating back into cover to allow the autoloader to refill back with its three shells, or simply wait for the gun to reload one shell and fire. The latter option is viable due to the Chi-Ri's good reload speed even without the autoloader. The decent gun depression of -10Â° allows the Chi-Ri to exploit hull-down positions to maximize cover, so use that to gain a battlefield advantage.
