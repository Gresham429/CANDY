Usage of Type_87_RCV: 
As a wheeled reconnaissance vehicle with only a 25 mm autocannon to use, it's best played in its intended role, spotting the enemy team, using its fast manoeuvrability to flank, and shooting down low flying aircraft. It is best compared to the R3 T20 FA-HS with the benefits that a light tank gets: scouting and reducing SP for aircraft spawns.
