History of Ro-Go: 
After World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army experimented with some possibility of multi-turreted tanks design based French Renault FT light tank. The development of the Type 95 Ro-Go heavy tank is based on the older version of the tank, the Type 91 heavy tank, which featured only a single 57 mm gun and two turrets, which both armed with a 6.5 mm machine guns. The tank had a maximum armour plate thickness of 17 mm. Although the design was not successful and soon cancelled, this project became the stepping stone to the Type 95 Ro-Go tank.
