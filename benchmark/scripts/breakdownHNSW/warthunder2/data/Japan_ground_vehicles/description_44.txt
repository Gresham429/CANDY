Description of Heavy_Tank_No.6_(Japan): 
The Heavy Tank No.6 is a Japanese-purchased Tiger I meant to be shipped over to Japan by submarine to bolster Japanese tank forces and research material. The transfer was never issued due to the continued increase of Allied naval supremacy, and the Tiger was loaned "back" to the Germans and used in the 101st SS heavy tank battalion in Belgium.
