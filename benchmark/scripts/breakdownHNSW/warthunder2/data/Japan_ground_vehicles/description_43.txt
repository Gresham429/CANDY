Description of SUB-I-II: 
The Mitsubishi SUB-I-II was a prototype for the Type 73 APC meant to replace the smaller Type 60 APC. Going through multiple prototypes, this particular version was tested with a Rh202 (20 mm) as a self-defense and anti-air cannon, though this armament would not see use in the final version.
