Description of Type_74_(C): 
The Type 74 (C) is among the earliest production variants of the Type 74, featuring the early ammunition set for the 105 mm L7A3 cannon. It was built up as the production model for Japan's 2nd generation of MBTs to combat tanks such as the T-62 and compare to the M60 or Leopard 1, while supplementing and replacing the Type 61. While a feature-full tank with hydropneumatic suspension and an effective 105 mm L7A3 cannon, it was a pretty late Gen 2 entry, as the 3rd generation of MBTs (such as the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams) would enter service just a few years later.
