History of Ta-Se: 
In 1941, Japanese command ordered armoured self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The new vehicle was supposed to be based on a Type 98 Ke-Ni tank chassis and had a 20 mm canon. The vehicle had a Type 100 air-cooled diesel engine with an output of 96.9 kW. After testing the vehicle, it was decided not to put it into series production, so only one Ta-se was built.
