History of M16_MGMC_(Japan): 
Prior to the creation of the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force in July of 1954, the Japanese were delegated a security force called the "National Safety Force" (NSF) in 1952. Similar in function to the national police, they were trained by American officers and equipped with American military equipment including most firearms and uniforms. Limited under treaty from building their own military designs, Japan sought assistance from the US to provide its heavy equipment. In particular, Japanese personnel were supplied with 168 M16 half-tracks for logistical needs but also close infantry support. M45 turrets with quad .50 cal mountings were supplied from surplus American stocks and fitted to the vehicles. Under the 1st District Force (NSF), the first anti-air units were comprised using the "hand-me-down" M16s. These vehicles would pass into the JGSDF in 1954 and while they would see use until 1974, almost 20 years after America had discontinued their M16s, they eventually were deemed obsolete for their primary purpose.
