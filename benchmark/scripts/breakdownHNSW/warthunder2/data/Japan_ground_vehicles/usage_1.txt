Usage of Ha-Go: 
As a light tank in a Rank I battle, the best overall tactic is to get the first jump on an enemy since the Ha-Go's gun is able to penetrate most tank's armour, yet everyone else's can also penetrate the Ha-Go. In an offensive, try to attack the enemy from a direction not covered to catch them by surprise, then exploit it by using the Ha-Go's mobility to keep moving around the enemy once it gets close so the enemy could not get an accurate bead on it. In a defensive, hold back and try to cover a single area of contact so the Ha-Go could dispel its fire on any enemy approaching.
