These modular slots allow for the seamless interchangeability of armour kits, ranging from lightweight to standard and even specialized war kits. The TKX (P) is the foundational platform for the Type 10 series, presenting a "barebones" configuration ready to accommodate various modular armour configurations tailored to specific operational requirements.
