Description of Chi-Nu_II: 
The Chi-Nu II was one of two planned improvements to the Type 3 Chi-Nu. The primary goal was to up-arm the Chi-Nu with a Type 5 (75 mm) found on the Type 4 Chi-To and Type 5 Chi-Ri. The first plan was to simply mount a Chi-To turret on top of the Chi-Nu hull, which was tested at the Japanese firing range at Irago, with tests found satisfactory. The second plan was to fit the Type 5 cannon inside of a regular Chi-Nu turret, which is represented by this version.
