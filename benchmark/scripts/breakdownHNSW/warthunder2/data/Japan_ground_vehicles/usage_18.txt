Usage of Chi-Ha_LG: 
With its powerful gun but lacking protection, the Chi-Ha LG should be played as a sniper. The good muzzle velocity and powerful shells (with up 1.7 kg of explosive filler) make it a threat for every vehicle. However, being able to carry only 10 shells is a disadvantage. Staying near captured points is ideal to refill your ammunition storage when necessary but it will expose you to artillery strikes. With its massive gun and gun breech, enemy tanks will likely target you first, so stay behind bushes or cover. Also, staying near buildings or trees will give the enemy planes a harder time to see you. Avoid open fields. With its open gun shield, armour is non existent. Even 7,92 mm machine guns can knock out the whole crew (only the driver is protected). When no machine guns or autocannons are used by the enemy, the Chi-Ha LG can get very survivable. If the enemy fires a shell at you, they will most likely hit the driver or one of the two loaders, leaving the rest of the crew alive. Despite having a 120 mm gun with good muzzle velocity, it only has 103 mm of penetration: that means the "point and click" option won't always work, you have to aim shots precisely.
