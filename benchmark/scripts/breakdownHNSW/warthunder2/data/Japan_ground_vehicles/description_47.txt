Description of M47_(Japan): 
The 90 mm Gun Tank M47 Patton II was sent by the US to Japan for trials to evaluate its potential as the JGSDF was looking for a new medium tank design. But due to the Japanese order being backlogged because of the German order of M47s, the Japanese started development on their own tank beginning with ST-A series towards the Type 61 MBT. Somewhere halfway through the development, an American M47 could finally be acquired and was compared to the progress the Japanese already had, and it was decided that the Japanese maintained course in developing their own tank instead of ordering more of the M47.
