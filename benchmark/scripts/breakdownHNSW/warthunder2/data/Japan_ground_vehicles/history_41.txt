History of M36_(Japan): 
Due to the outbreak of the Korean War, the GHQ (General Headquarters of Allied occupation) ordered Japan to re-militarize, while the US also provided plenty of M4A3 (76) W and M24 tanks to help Japan form their armed police force, the NPR (National Police Reserve), so more US forces could fight in Korea while Japan could still maintain reserve manpower for defense. However, the tanks that the NPR received were too big for the average Japanese tanker. In order to replace the obsolete Sherman and Chaffee tanks, Japan received a M36 for research purposes, to help develop a new domestically designed tank, which would eventually become the Type 61.
