Description of Ro-Go: 
The Type 95 Ro-Go (九五式重戦車「ロ号」) was a Japanese heavy tank design that joined the trend of multi-turret tank designs such as the T-28, T-35, and the Independent. While it was the second Japanese tank that was adopted for service after the Type 89 I-Go, its combat trials in Manchuria proved that the production, cost, weight, and mobility were problems and resulted in not seeing mass production.
