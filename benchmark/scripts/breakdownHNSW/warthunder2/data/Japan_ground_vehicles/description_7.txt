Description of Ho-Ro: 
The Type 4 Ho-Ro (四式十五糎自走砲「ホロ」) is an open-topped self-propelled gun with a short-barreled 150 mm howitzer, based on the Chi-Ha. Being pressed instantly into service on its creation, a dozen or so were shipped to the Philippines together with the newly formed 1st Self-Propelled Artillery Company. While it did see combat with several confirmed Sherman destructions, it was effectively used in close-quarter combat rather than as an artillery piece, firing at Shermans at 100-200 m range in smokey and low visibility scenarios, and repositioning on each shot. Arriving in Dec 1944, the last Ho-Ro squad served until knocked out in Mar 1945 with the remainder of the company fighting until the end in the mountains as regular infantry.
