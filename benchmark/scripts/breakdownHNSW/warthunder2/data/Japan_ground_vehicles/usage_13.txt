Usage of Ka-Chi: 
When downtiered, the tank can survive hits from most enemy shells at its BR. The surprisingly good armour and the good survivability make it a heavy tank. Its 47 mm gun won't have any trouble penetrating the enemy armour at its BR. The Ka-Chi's armour is thick, but also flat: angling gives the tank a higher chance to bounce shells.
