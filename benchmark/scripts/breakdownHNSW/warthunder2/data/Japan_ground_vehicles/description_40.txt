Description of ST-A3: 
The ST-A3 was the third and last finished prototype for the Type 61. Being part of the second phase of development for the Type 61, together with the ST-A4 it overcame the transmission problems the ST-A1/2 had, and the overall vehicle design was pretty much the same as the final production model. While the ST-A4 was a later prototype, it was completed earlier than the ST-A3, and due to the ease of manufacturing and enlarged cupola became the basis for the Type 61 MBT. This left the ST-A3 behind as a promising prototype incorporating an autoloader.
