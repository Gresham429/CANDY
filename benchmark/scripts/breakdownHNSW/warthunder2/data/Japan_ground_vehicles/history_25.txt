History of Chi-Nu: 
By 1943, the tanks of the Imperial Japanese Army like the Type 95 Ha-Go and Type 97 Chi-Ha plus its improved variant were deemed to be falling behind in terms of modernizing tank designs of the American and European counterparts. This came to attention when their contact in Germany gave them information on the new Allied tanks like the American M4 Sherman. A tank able to fight these newer machines was needed, but development takes time and resources that the IJA tank industry do not have a surplus of. Eventually, an expedient was ordered as a dedicated new design was developed.[1][2] The expedient was to use a modified Type 90 75 mm field gun, a gun already proven to be effective against Allied tanks during the Philippines campaign, by adapting the gun into the Type 3 (75 mm) in models I and II[2]. The model I went onto the Type 1 Ho-Ni III and the model II went to the tank design.
