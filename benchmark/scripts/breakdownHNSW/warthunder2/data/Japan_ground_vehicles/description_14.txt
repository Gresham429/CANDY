Description of Chi-Ha_Kai: 
The Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai (九七式中戦車 改「チハ」) was the most capable Japanese tank that saw combat in WWII. Being an upgrade on the Chi-Ha, it was armed with a new turret (ShinHōtō) boasting the Type 1 (47 mm) cannon to compete with late 1930s armour. Proving themselves very successful in the early Pacific campaign through Corregidor Island and Malaya, effectiveness fell flat when faced against the M4 Shermans of the 1940s, and as a result created the negative stigma of Japanese tank quality.
