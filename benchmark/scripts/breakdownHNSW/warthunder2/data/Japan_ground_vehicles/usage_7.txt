Usage of Ho-Ro: 
The Ho-Ro is a fairly manoeuvrable SPG, and like many other open-topped vehicles, this is not one that should charge into the front-lines. Just like many of the other low-rank Japanese vehicles, it has no real armour protection from anything more than rifle-calibre MGs, and its ammo storage is literally a box mounted on top of the engine deck. The crew is very exposed, and the gun breech is mounted rather high on the chassis and can be easily knocked out. With this knowledge in mind, the Ho-Ro is best played by staying in the rear (but not distantly) of friendly tanks for short-range or point-blank artillery fire, along with finding hidden positions where it can attempt to be hull-down out of sight of the enemy.
