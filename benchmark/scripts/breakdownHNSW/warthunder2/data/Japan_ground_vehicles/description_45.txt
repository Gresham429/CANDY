Description of Ho-Ri_Prototype: 
The Experimental Type 5 Gun Tank (Ho-Ri) (試製五式砲戦車 「ホリ」) was one of 3 tank designs for a new Japanese tank destroyer housing the new powerful Type 5 (105 mm) anti-tank gun to deal with the heaviest of Allied armour the US might throw at the Japanese mainland. This Ho-Ri was the final design out of the 3: unlike the 2 previous designs, it was not directly based on the Chi-Ri, but only a hull based on the Chi-Ri, featuring the same engine but with a sloped front hull design to increase armour effectiveness.
