Usage of I-Go_Ko: 
The Type 89b I-Go Ko, despite its rather tractor-esque look, is a mobile tank that could use its speed to get to an enemy's flanks and cause some serious damage. The 57 mm cannon is unfortunately rather pitiful even in Rank I, with a penetration value of between 20 to 30 mm with APHE at standard combat ranges. Therefore, it is usually best to catch enemies unaware and go for flanking shots against their weaker side armour by driving around, instead of directly toward them. The 57 mm low-velocity shell does have an advantage of a rather prominent parabolic trajectory so it is possible to lob shells over hills to hit unsuspecting enemies behind it.
