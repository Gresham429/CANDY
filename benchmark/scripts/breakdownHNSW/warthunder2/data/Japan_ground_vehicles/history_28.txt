History of Chi-Ri_II: 
Under the pretext of their lacklustre tank designs, the Japanese worked on creating a tank that could surpass the Allies' main tank, the M4 Sherman. Upgraded designs made to deal with the Sherman led to the Type 3 Chi-Nu and the Type 4 Chi-To. While these two were quite capable against the Sherman, they did not represent the best that the Japanese had to offer.
