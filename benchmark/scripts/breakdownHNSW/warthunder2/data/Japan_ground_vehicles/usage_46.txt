Usage of Type_87_RCV_(P): 
The Type 87 RCV (Prototype) is a specialized vehicle that is designed for reconnaissance and light combat support. RCV stands for Recon Combat Vehicle, which indicates its main function of scouting the enemy positions and engaging targets that are vulnerable to its 20 mm auto-cannon. The auto-cannon can fire at a high rate and is effective against infantry, low-flying aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles such as trucks, APCs and IFVs. However, the auto-cannon has limited penetration and damage against heavily armoured vehicles such as tanks and SPGs. The auto-cannon can only disable the tracks or barrels of these vehicles, but it would require a lot of ammunition and time to do so. Therefore, it is not advisable to use the Type 87 RCV against armoured targets, but rather to report them to the team and let them handle the threat. The Type 87 RCV should be used on wide flanks, where it can exploit its mobility to find advantageous positions and spot out enemy vehicles. It can also destroy or suppress enemy snipers such as ATGM carriers and soft SPGs that are hiding in the rear. The Type 87 RCV should avoid direct confrontation with the enemy, but rather focus on providing intelligence and fire support for the team.
