Description of Ka-Chi: 
The Special Type 3 Ka-Chi (特三式内火艇 「カチ」) was an improvement program by the Navy over the Ka-Mi, going larger and stronger using the Chi-He as a base instead of the Ha-Go. During development the idea of making the tank transportable by submarine came up, allowing the tank to stealthily approach islands, emerge with the submarine, and off-load into the water to then land on the island amphibiously. While a very potent tank and operationally interesting, the Navy had more pressing issues during 1943-45 on top of being on the defensive, the Ka-Chi's priority and use case was diminished. Only 12 - 19 were built and all were reserved for homeland defense.
