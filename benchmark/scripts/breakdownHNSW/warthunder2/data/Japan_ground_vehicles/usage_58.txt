Usage of Type_87: 
As an anti-aircraft vehicle, you should push with your team and defend cap points by protecting allies from aircraft with your powerful 35 mm guns. It should not be a problem to stay away from the main battle unless you are being pushed or your position is being overrun. In case if you see enemy light SPG or light tank, you can try to destroy them as well. With APDS belt you may dare to attack decently armoured medium tanks from the side, but you only have enough ammo for one or two encounters, so make it count.
