Description of TKX: 
The TKX, more precisely the TKX-2-0005, is the 3rd prototype towards the Type 10. It was developed soon after the Type 90 to supplement and replace the ageing Type 74s and Type 90s. The TKX was designed between 2002 to 2009 until it was adopted in service in 2010 as the Type 10. Its primary function was to be lighter than the Type 90 with equally effective armour, to access most Japanese infrastructure without hitting the weight limit, and a bigger emphasis on C4I which couldn't properly be fitted into the Type 74s and Type 90s.
