Description of Type_90: 
The Type 90 (90式戦車) was initially accepted into service in 1990 as a replacement for both the Type 61 and Type 74 models. With the Type 74 adopting service, it was rather late to the scene and had to compare with the newer generation of MBTs like the T-72 (Family), Leopard 2 (Family) and M1 Abrams (Family). For that reason, the Type 90's development was called instantly after the Type 74's adoption. While closely resembling Western-style MBTs, the emphasises of the Type 90 lay in its technical features from the FCS system, Onboard computer, automated tracking and autoloader.
