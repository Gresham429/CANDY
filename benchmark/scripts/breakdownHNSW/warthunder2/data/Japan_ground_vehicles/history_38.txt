History of ST-A2: 
The ST-A2 is an experimental medium Japanese tank, one of the first vehicles developed by Japan after the war. When the question of the need to develop new military vehicles came to the fore, Japanese experts with previous experience from the war got to work. The ST-A1 was the first step, and was intended to lack the main drawbacks of the American vehicles in service with the Japan Self-Defense Forces, more specifically their weight, size and their controls, unsuitable to Japanese tankers for physiological reasons. The development of ST-A1 began in 1954 and was ready by December 1956. The next stage on the path to the series-produced Type 61 was the new ST-A2, put into development in 1956.
