Usage of Ro-Go_Exp.: 
The Ro-Go Experimental plays like its predecessor on the tech tree, the Ho-Ro, but with some key differences. It has a faster reload time, but is noticeably less mobile and a larger target, a trait inherited from its basis on the Ro-Go chassis. Also unlike the Ho-Ro, the SAPCBC round has very good penetration and does not rely solely on HE filler to cause damage. It is completely open topped and the gun shield is only 12 mm thick, making the exposed crew extremely vulnerable to CAS and heavy machine gun fire. However, the Ro-Go Exp. does have some tricks up its sleeve - specifically the rear machine gunner. Like the Ro-Go, this crewman is largely useless in terms of offense, but will rarely be the first to be knocked out in a fight, essentially giving the player a somewhat guaranteed crew replacement. Play the Ro-Go Exp. like you would other Rank I and II Japanese Tank Destroyers, either freelance and find a good spot to get the jump on opponents, or stay back with other players and support from the rear. Like other Japanese SPG's, you are somewhat of a glass cannon. Remember that you can only spawn with 16 rounds maximum.
