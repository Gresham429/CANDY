Description of Type_89: 
The Type 89 IFV (89式装甲戦闘車) entered service with the JSDF in 1989. It supplements the APCs that preceded it, such as the Type 60 APC, Type 73 APC and other wheeled APCs, which were vulnerable without tank support. The Type 89 IFV was developed from 1980 to 1989, when it was officially adopted. It was meant to work with the Type 90 tank in different regions, but due to budget constraints and high cost of the Type 89 IFV, only about 120 vehicles were produced by 2014 out of an order for 300, mainly deployed in Hokkaido.
