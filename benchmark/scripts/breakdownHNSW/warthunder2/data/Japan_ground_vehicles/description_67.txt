Description of Type_90B_%22Fuji%22: 
This Type 90 (B) belongs to the Fuji Tank Instructor Corps (3rd Company), tasked with training the newest aspiring tank crews in their duties and responsibilities as tankers in the JGSDF. Key aspects to learn about the Type 90 MBT include its top-notch features and capabilities, such as its state-of-the-art autoloader, which allows the tank to fire every 4 seconds, and its hydropneumatic suspension, enabling the gun to be depressed or elevated in any direction with the hull's position. Its advanced electronics feature a thermal gunner camera, laser rangefinder, and laser warning system, alerting the crew to any potential enemy targeting the tank. The performance of the Type 90's strong engine, coupled with its below-par armour, dictates tactics that rely heavily on flanking or sniping from a hull-down position, eliminating as many targets in quick succession before retreating to reposition and engage again.
