Usage of So-Ki: 
The So-Ki can use its speed to capture bases and attack lightly armoured targets when the opportunity presents itself. For the most part the So-Ki should fit its purpose in the AA role, rather than an AT one. The sound of aircraft engines will let the player know if potential enemies (and targets) are coming.
