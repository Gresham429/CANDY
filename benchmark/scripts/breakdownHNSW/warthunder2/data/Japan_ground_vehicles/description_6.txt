Description of Ho-I: 
The Type 2 Ho-I (二式砲戦車「ホイ」) was designed to uparm the Chi-Ha's 57 mm low velocity cannon to a 75 mm low velocity to beat bunkers the Chi-Ha couldn't. Development to squeeze a 75 mm into the turret of the Chi-Ha or Chi-Ha Kai took some time and only by 1941 was a Type 1 Experimental Ho-I ready, but for production the Chi-He hull was chosen to ease up production.
