Description of M4A3_(76)_W_(Japan): 
The Medium Tank M4A3 (76) W HVSS Sherman (or just â–…M4A3 (76) W) was, together with the M24, provided by the Americans to the Japanese to rebuild Japan's military in self-defense due to the outbreak of the Korean war. While they were initially supposed to receive M26 Pershings, the US Department of State opposed and kept it to the weaker surplus Shermans and Chaffees. With the Japanese deciding to build their own tank shortly after due to the weaker firepower the Sherman provided over 90 mm's and the relatively large size for the average Japanese tanker, the M4A3 (76) W was eventually replaced in end of the same decade by the Type 61.
