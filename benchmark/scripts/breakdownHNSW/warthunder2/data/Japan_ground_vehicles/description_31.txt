Description of M42_(Japan): 
The Twin 40 mm Self-Propelled Gun M42 Duster was purchased by the JSDF to replace the aging M19 in the 1960s. While the Type 87 was still in development, only a few M42s were bought, due to the high development cost of the Type 87. Even though the Type 87 was adopted in 1987, the M42 stayed in service until 1994 to fill the ranks.
