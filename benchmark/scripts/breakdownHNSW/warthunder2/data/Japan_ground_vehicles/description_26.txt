Description of Chi-To: 
The Type 4 Chi-To (四式中戦車 「チト」) was developed as a counter to the ever-pressing danger the Sherman possessed over Japanese 1930s infantry based tanks such as the Ha-Go and Chi-Ha. The main development point of the Chi-To (and its heavier counterpart, the Chi-Ri II) was the new high-velocity long barrel 75 mm and a new hull design over the Chi-Ha / Chi-He family allowing for larger upgrades in armour, engine, and cannons. However, due to delays in hull production and lengthy cannon development, the Chi-To would only be ready in 1945 for evaluation, and the Chi-Nu and Ho-Ni III were built as stopgap measures to fill the gap of Sherman-capable competitors until the Chi-To was fully ready.
