History of Ka-Chi: 
With the success of the Navy's Type 2 Special Motorboat Ka-Mi, a more ambitious project to create a bigger, more advanced vehicle was forwarded. Called the Type 3 Special Motorboat, it was not only meant as a fully ocean-going boat but capable of travelling submerged underwater as cargo on the back of a submarine. To withstand the depths (reported as deep as 100 m / 330 ft), the primary pressure hull was a cylinder between 2.0 and 2.1 m (6 ft 7 in) in diameter. Most of the machinery was taken from the Type 1 Chi-He medium tank, presumably to save costs and development time. Like the Ka-Mi, removable sea-going fore and aft pontoons were part of the design, however, they were not required to be amphibious. Navigation was accomplished by rudders attached to the rear pontoon. The vehicle-mounted twin screws could also be independently controlled to maintain a level of steering without the rudders. Nineteen units were reportedly built and extensively tested to success but were never used in combat as they were held back for the defence of the Japanese home islands.
