Description of Ha-Go_Commander: 
The Type 95 Ha-Go Commander (九五式軽戦車 指揮車型「ハ号」) is the tank assigned to the commander of a tank company within the Japanese armoured forces. In the early stages, the Japanese, like many others, did not widely equip their tanks with radios, relying instead on signal flags. To ensure the tank of the company commander remained visible, it was often painted with relatively unique camouflage patterns or insignias. Command versions featured various modifications and deviations from standard production procedures. Some were equipped with a radio and circular antenna on the commander's cupola, while others, like this one, were fitted with smoke dischargers (although this feature was not exclusive to command vehicles).
