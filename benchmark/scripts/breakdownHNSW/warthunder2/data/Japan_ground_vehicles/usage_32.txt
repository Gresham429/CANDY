Usage of Chi-Nu_II: 
The Chi-Nu II is one of the best bargains you can get for the price, it has a high penetrating Type 5 cannon at a lower BR of the regular tanks carrying it (Chi-To, Chi-Ri II) in a tight package of the Chi-Nu, this comes with a somewhat weaker engine (compared to the heavier Chi-To & Chi-Ri) but the pro's outweigh the con's.
