Description of Type_99: 
The Type 99 155 mm SPH (99式自走155mmりゅう弾砲) is currently one of the 155 mm howitzers in JGSDF service as the direct replacement of the obsolete, shorter-barreled Type 75 155 mm SPH. The JGSDF had already planned for a replacement of the Type 75 SPH as early as 1985; development began in 1987, with MHI responsible for the extended hull based on the chassis of what would become the Type 89 IFV, while JSW developed the weapon systems with a domestic 155 mm L/52 howitzer. The new SPH was ready for trials in 1996, and tests were conducted in 1998, with the first four SPH units delivered to the training corps. However, due to the high unit price, the complete replacement of all Type 75 SPHs will be fulfilled by the Type 99 SPH alongside a new, wheeled Type 19 155 mm SPH.
