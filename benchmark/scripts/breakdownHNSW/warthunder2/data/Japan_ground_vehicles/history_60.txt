History of Type_74_(G): 
In 1993, a program was launched to upgrade 4 Type 74 tanks to a new Type 74 Kai (mod. G) standard. The tanks were equipped with the NBC protection system of the Type 90, a passive infrared camera like the Type 90, a laser detection device linked with smoke launchers and side skirts. The program was abandoned quickly as the upgrade proved too expensive in a context of military budget reduction due to the end of the Cold War.
