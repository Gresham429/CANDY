Description of Chi-Nu: 
The Type 3 Chi-Nu (三式中戦車 「チヌ」) was built as a stop-gap measure in the pursuit to get M4 Sherman-killers such as the Chi-To & Chi-Ri II which still were being developed. The Japanese tank designers simply opted for the Chi-He hull, uplift the Type 90 (75 mm) field gun as a dedicated tank gun as the Type 3 (75 mm) tank gun and create a new hexagonal turret to house the cannon on the hull. With Japanese tank production having low priority and the Chi-Nu being greenlit in 1943, production only started in 1944 and were all reserved for the defense of the mainland.
