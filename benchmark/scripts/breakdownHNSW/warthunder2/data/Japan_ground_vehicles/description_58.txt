Description of Type_87: 
The Twin 35 mm Self-Propelled Gun Type 87 is a Japanese self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, roughly similar in concept to the Flakpanzer Gepard to replace the M15 and M42 in Japanese service. Initially designed to utilize the Type 61 hull, development was switched to the newly available Type 74 hull to keep it up to date. It is commonly nicknamed as "Guntank" by Japanese crews after the similar-looking mecha in the Mobile Suit Gundam series.
