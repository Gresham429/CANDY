Description of Chi-Ha: 
The Type 97 Chi-Ha (九七式中戦車「チハ」) was developed to replace the Type 89 I-Go and essentially be a 4-man version of the Type 95 Ha-Go as the 37 mm had little explosive power to deal with infantry. The Mitsubishi "Chi-Ha" competed with the cheaper design Osaka Arsenal "Chi-Ni", selected under the opportunity by the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War which increased the army's budget and left funds available for the more capable Type 97 Chi-Ha tank. Being the main medium tank of the Japanese after adoption, it would also serve as the main chassis for the army and variants.
