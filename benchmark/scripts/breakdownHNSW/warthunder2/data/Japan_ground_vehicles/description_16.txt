Description of Ho-Ni_I: 
The Type 1 Ho-Ni I (一式砲戦車「ホニI」) was a Japanese tank destroyer and self-propelled gun that used the Type 97 chassis and engine, and mounted a Type 90 75 mm field gun in an open casemate. It was developed in 1941 and produced in 1942, with only 26 units built. It was intended to provide fire support and anti-tank capabilities for the Japanese armoured divisions. It participated in its first and only combat in the Battle of Luzon in the Philippines in 1945. There, it faced superior US forces and many units were lost. The Japanese army replaced it with two new types of self-propelled guns: the Ho-Ni II, which specialized in shelling enemy positions, and the Ho-Ni III, which focused on destroying enemy tanks. Some Ho-Ni I units stayed in Japan for home defense until the end of the war.
