Usage of M47_(Japan): 
The M47 is often considered a "glass cannon". With a powerful gun but poor armour, it is recommended to play this vehicle carefully and conservatively. As such, it is often beneficial to use an ambush or flanking-based playstyle. Attacking enemies from soft or hard cover without being seen can maximize this tank's capabilities.
