History of STB-2: 
The prototype for the Type 74. Known in Japanese as 74式戦車の試作車STB-1 (ななよんしきせんしゃのしさくしゃSTB-1). Created in September 1969 along with STB-2 in the STT program. Due to issues with cost effectiveness these two prototypes were not considered for the replacement of the Type 61. In a bid to reduce costs STB-3, STB-4, STB-5 and STB-6 were produced between April 1970 to December 1971. The final judgement for the STT program was held in November 1973 which lead the line to be completed in 1974. And, production started the following year in 1975 for the Type 74.
