Usage of Na-To: 
With the Lightweight Type I Model II tank gun, the Na-To presents a lethal gun that can penetrate all the the tanks at its 3.3 BR range. Assuming it is not upped by another vehicle in the line-up with a higher BR, the worst heavy tank the Na-To could face are the Soviet KV-1S and British Churchill Mk III, both with front armour easily penetrable by the Na-To's 75 mm gun at standard ranges without taking angling into consideration. However, the thin armour of the Na-To does mean that any tank it faces could defeat the Na-To, so always get the first shot off at the enemy.
