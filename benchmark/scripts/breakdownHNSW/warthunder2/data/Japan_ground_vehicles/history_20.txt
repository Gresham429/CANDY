History of So-Ki: 
Prior to World War II, Japan experimented with developing anti-aircraft guns based on several different platforms, including trucks, tanks and railroad cars. Production ended up developing an SPAAG that could shoot down aircraft at low altitudes. The Japanese military, however, wanted their SPAAGs to have the capability to also shoot down aircraft at medium altitudes too. Alongside the range requirements, the vehicle needed to be highly mobile to provide adequate protection to convoys from aerial attack.
