Description of Type_61: 
The Type 61 was the first Japanese service MBT of the JGSDF, developed on the ST-A series of prototypes to replace the ageing M4A3 (76) and M24 which on top of their age were too large for the average-sized Japanese crew member. While most of the components of the Type 61 were of American origin, the design and role of the tank were purely Japanese. While the tank was a serviceable Japanese equivalent of the M26 Pershing and Patton (M46/47/48) series, it was only introduced in 1961 with production only catching up in 1970, it started to show its age compared to the newer generation of tanks like the M60, T-62, and Leopard 1. The Type 61 remained in service until 2000 when it was finally completely replaced by the Type 74 MBT and the roll-in phase of the Type 90 MBT.
