Usage of Chi-Nu: 
This tank can be played in a similar fashion to the Pz.IV F2. Using its good mobility and excellent gun, the Chi-Nu can hit enemies at medium/ long range from a position of cover, steadily advancing towards the enemy lines. The frontal armour is stronger than a Pz.IV F2 (same thickness, more slope), but is still weak and will not protect the Chi-Nu from most guns at BR 3.3. The side armour is particularly weak, so be careful of flank attacks.
