Description of Type_74_(G): 
The Type 74 mod G/Kai was a service life extension program for the Type 74 initiated in 1993 to keep it in service alongside the newer Type 90 MBT. The program involved adding a passive infrared camera, side skirts, and new electronics to the tank, as well as adjusting the rear driving wheel to prevent track detachment. Although four Type 74 (G) tanks were tested and produced satisfactory results, the cost of upgrading all Type 74s was estimated at 100 million yen. As a result, only five Type 74s were upgraded. Eventually, the Type 74s were replaced by the Type 16 MCV.
