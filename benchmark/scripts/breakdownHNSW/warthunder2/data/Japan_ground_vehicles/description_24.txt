Description of M24_(Japan): 
The Light Tank M24 SDF was, together with the M4A3 (76) W, provided by the Americans to the Japanese to rebuild Japan's military in self defense due to the outbreak of the Korean war. Generally liked by its new Japanese crews, the Chaffee was rather inadequate for its service time within the JGSDF, only offering a short barrel 75 mm, it was already outdated facing tanks such as the T-34-85.
