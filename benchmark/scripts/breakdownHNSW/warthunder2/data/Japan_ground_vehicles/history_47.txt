History of M47_(Japan): 
Japan started redeveloping its military in the form of the JSDF. Previously issued with surplus WWII-era American vehicles like M4A3 Shermans, M24 Chaffees, M15A1 CGMCs and other equipment, the JGSDF would want to gain a step up in tank development as the communist threat in Korea loomed close to the Japanese homeland. The JGSDF would attempt to get their hands on a new American medium tank that would become a staple of the Cold War, the M47 'Patton II'. Unfortunately for the Japanese, the American assembly lines for the tank were already backlogged with various other foreign orders, primarily from West Germany.
