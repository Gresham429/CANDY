Usage of Ro-Go: 
The Type 95 Ro-Go, like most landships, is the perfect vehicle to lead an assault. It can take a beating due its relatively thick armour and with the crew placement it shouldn't be an easy task to simply knock it out with a single shell. The tricky part about the Ro-Go is the difference between shell velocities of the two cannons, the 70 mm has an abysmal muzzle velocity and quick drop off rate with 300 m/s on the Type 95 APHE and a mere 200 m/s on the Type 3 HEAT while the secondary cannon, a 37 mm Type 94, found on the Type 95 Ha-Go has 575 m/s. As last armament to mention the Ro-Go has a MG turret in the back of the tank, which in-game won't really see much use and can be seen as a safe spot for the last crew member, but in-case a light armoured truck tries to flank the Ro-Go and no-one is covering the back, as last resort the MG could prove handy.
