Usage of Ho-Ri_Production: 
The Ho-Ri can be used in multiple roles. Its most effective at medium range, where it's harder for the enemy to aim for the lower plate and shells have a harder time penetrating the mantlet, making it easy for you to destroy them. The Ho-Ri is also quite potent at long range, particularly in down-tiers, where your gun remains effective (though less so) and your armour becomes even better. Be careful using it as a brawler, however. Your transmission is easier to hit, the mantlet is easier to penetrate, and faster foes can surround you easier and get a shot at your weak side armour.
