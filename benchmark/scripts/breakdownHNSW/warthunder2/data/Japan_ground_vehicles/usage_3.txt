Usage of Ka-Mi: 
With its average armour, firepower and mobility, the Ka-Mi should be played wisely, with a bit of finesse: you will not survive frontal engagement, neither can you flank nor snipe. This leaves you the support role. Always play as a team when driving the Ka-Mi, bringing an additional potent close-range gun to the fight, threatening your foes while more potent allies reload.
