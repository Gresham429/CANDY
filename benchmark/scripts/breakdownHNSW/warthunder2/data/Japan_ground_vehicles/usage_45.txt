Usage of Ho-Ri_Prototype: 
The Ho-Ri can be used in multiple roles. Its most effective at medium range, where it's harder for the enemy to aim for the lower plate and shells have a harder time penetrating the mantlet, making it easy for you to destroy them. Another option, although risky is to sit on a road that players like to go down and use your armour to bounce and take shot and return fire on enemy tanks.
