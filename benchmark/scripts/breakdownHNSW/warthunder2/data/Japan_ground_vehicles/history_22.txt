History of Chi-He_(5th_Regiment): 
The Imperial Japanese Army's main tank, the Type 97 Chi-Ha, was becoming rather outdated by the turn of the decade in 1940. The 30 mm front plate armour was vulnerable to standard anti-tank weaponry and the riveted design posed a hazard to the tank crew by spalling. In 1941, work began on modernizing the design up to new industrial standards.[1]
