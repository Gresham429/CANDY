Usage of Type_60_SPRG_(C): 
The Type 60 SPRG is predominately suited to short-range ambushes of opposition tanks. It is quite diminutive in stature and relatively mobile allowing it to manoeuvre into position, typically behind a hill, where it can use the impressive 20Â° degree of gun depression, to quickly pop up and deliver dual 106 mm M40 to a target before pulling back to reload or relocate. In AB, you can use scouting to mark interesting targets and hide away while keeping re-scouting them, to virtually disappear from the map for a while.
