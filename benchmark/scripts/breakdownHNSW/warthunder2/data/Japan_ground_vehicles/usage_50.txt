Usage of Type_99: 
With a very high shell velocity of 940 m/s but low armor and a high profile, the Type 99 155 mm should be played as either a sniping vehicle or an anti-air vehicle. With the L15A2 high explosive shells, which have an explosive mass of 14.8 kg of TNT, it can destroy every vehicle at its rank and higher with a well-placed shot between the hull and the turret (Even the Maus or the Object 279 heavy tank). The hull of the Type 99 155 mm also has a large empty spot without any important modules, meaning that some enemy shells will just go through the hull without activating the explosive fuse, creating little to no damage. Your most problematic enemies you have to keep an eye of are other vehicles with large caliber cannons or vehicles with autocannons. Avoid artillery at any cost, since the chance of getting hit by the artillery is much higher than other tanks due to its very large profile of the Type 99 155 mm.
