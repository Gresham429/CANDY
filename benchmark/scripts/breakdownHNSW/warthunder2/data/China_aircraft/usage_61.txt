Usage of F-104G_(China): 
The F-104G does one thing extremely well: speed. This is the vehicle's greatest advantage, and can be used to great effect if the pilot is careful about choosing which engagements to pursue. It is recommended to keep up a high air-speed at all times, which will allow the F-104G to swoop in and out of the combat zone while evading enemies. Stick to boom-and-zoom attacks and avoid charging directly into combat. Keep a safe distance from enemy fighters, as it is easy for enemies to make the F-104G overshoot or otherwise reverse it. If an enemy gets on the F-104G's tail, there is not much one can do besides accelerating away or in emergencies using the roll rate to dodge fire and enter rolling scissors. If a safe distance is maintained, it is even possible to outrun enemy air-to-air missiles.
