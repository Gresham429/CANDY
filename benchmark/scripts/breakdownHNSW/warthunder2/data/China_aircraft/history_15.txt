History of P-66: 
In the late 1930s, the Vultee Aircraft Corporation, previously known for the V-1 airliner and the derivative V-11/V-12 attackers, began work on a Model 48 fighter aircraft intended for export. The Model 48 was based on the Hughes H-1B race aircraft designed earlier by Vultee's chief designer. Not long after work began, the US Army began looking for advanced trainer aircraft, and Vultee planned on making a family of aircraft based on the Model 48, sharing components of the wings, tail, and rear fuselage. Three trainers were ultimately produced this way, including the well known BT-13 Valiant.
