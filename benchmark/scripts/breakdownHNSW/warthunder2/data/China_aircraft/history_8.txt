History of I-153_M-62_(China): 
Since August 1937, the Soviet Union unofficially supported the Chinese Kuomintang Government against their traditional enemies, the Japanese in 1939 both selling military equipment and Soviet volunteer pilots (much like America had with its AVG). Initial support was with I-15 biplanes, but as the Japanese introduced the superior Nakajima Ki-27 the Soviets moved to counter the new threat.
