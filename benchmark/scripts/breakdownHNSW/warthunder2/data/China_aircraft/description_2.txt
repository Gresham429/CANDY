Description of Ki-27_otsu_(China): 
The ␗Ki-27 otsu, officially known as 中島 九七式戦闘機乙型 or by its Allies codename Nate, was one of the major type of fighters served in IJAAF during the early stages of 2nd Sino-Japanese War and been used by both factions of Chinese armed forces. As the replacement of previous Ki-10 biplane after IJAAF saw the potential of IJNAF's A6M, although still being manoeuvrable at the early stages, the major loss in Khalkhin Gol made IJAAF retired all Ki-27, leaving them as reserve aircraft of the puppet state of Manchuria; while the lack of spare parts and more advanced Japanese-captured/US Aid aircrafts didn't leave Ki-27 a chance as fighters for the Nationalist forces, the Communist side made good use of them as trainer aircrafts for engineers and pilots.
