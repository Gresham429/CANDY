Description of A-29: 
The A-29 first started out as the "Model 14 Super Electra", a successful commercial airliner. A few years later, Lockheed experimented with a recon/light bomber version of the Super Electra. As luck would have it, Britain was also looking for a combat aircraft for their own air force. Over 200 Hudsons' were delivered to the Royal Air Force where they would undergo further redesigns and improvements. The A-29 was one of Lockheed's redesigns which featured two Wright R-1820-27 but was largely the same aircraft as the A-28. China received 26 A-29 Hudsons, but not much is known about the A-29 in Chinese service as many were lost in accidents. Only a handful actually were put to use in combat.
