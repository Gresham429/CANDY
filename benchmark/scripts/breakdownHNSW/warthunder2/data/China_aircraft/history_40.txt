History of Tu-2S-44_(China): 
The Tupolev Tu-2 has already proved its capability against German forces and contributed a lot for the Eastern Front; while the WWII has ended, Tu-2 waited for another chance to shine, this time on the hands of PLAAF who were in need for a frontline bomber to handle Nationalist forces on coastal islands.
