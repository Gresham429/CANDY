History of Ki-43-III_ko_(China): 
According to the records from NRA, the Chinese Expeditionary Force captured a Ki-43-Ic (P-5017; tail number given after its capture) in Burma on 1942/4/29; this aircraft was later confirmed to be one of the fighter piloted by Yasuda Yoshito (安田義人) who later was known as the pilot who witnessed the final flight of Katō Kateo (加藤建夫), the commander of 64th Air Squadron (later nicknamed Kato Hayabusa Squadron 加藤隼戦闘隊) later on 22nd May. Three years later, by the time of the end of war, ROCAF acquired the remaining Ki-43s in Mainland China which were mostly stationed at Nanjing; likely due to their obsolete performance, lack of spare parts and upcoming US-built fighters, these aircrafts which were transferred to the 6th Wing of ROCAF were soon replaced by new fighters.
