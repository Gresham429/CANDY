Usage of J-6A: 
The J-6A has great vertical energy retention and acceleration, so you should use this to your advantage. Taking the enemies vertical is the best move as they will quickly lose energy while you can maintain it. Once at high speed, the J-6A will out-accelerate almost all other aircraft, so once you're on the tail of an enemy they will not have many options. The airbrake is also a very effective tool, allowing you to stay behind someone if they try to force you to overshoot and the plane also rolls well enough that you can engage in rolling scissors if need be.
