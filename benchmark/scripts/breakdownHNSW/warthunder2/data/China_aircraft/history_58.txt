History of Shenyang_F-5: 
The Soviet MiG-17 was used quite extensively by the PLAAF in the early Cold War era. A production license for the more advanced MiG-17F model, which featured an afterburner, was obtained in the mid-1950s, and the result was the domestic Shenyang J-5, which made its first flight in 1956. In 1961, plans were obtained for the license production of the radar-equipped MiG-17PF model, but the ongoing Sino-Soviet split led to issues with the Chinese industry that delayed the first flight of the "J-5A" to 1964. At this point, the aircraft was rather obsolete, with the supersonic age being well underway, and production only continued for a few more years. Fewer J-5s were produced than the later J-6.
