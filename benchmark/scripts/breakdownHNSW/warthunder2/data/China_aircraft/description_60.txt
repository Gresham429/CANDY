Description of F-100F_(China): 
The ␗F-100F Super Sabre, colloquially known as 超級軍刀機 (Super Sabre jet), was the twin-seater variant of F-100 and in fact the very first supersonic jet in ROCAF service which served until 1984; these jets were mostly identical to USAF variants minus INS for SEAD capabilities (F-100F is also the first Wild Wiesel jet). As part of the Military Aid Program (MAP) to ROCAF without any supersonic jet by August 1958 during the 1st Taiwan Strait Crisis, USAF immediately transferred six F-100F to ROCAF with four upcoming jets by September after the heat; meanwhile the single-seater F-100A with upgrades from the D series also arrived to ROCAF between 1958 to 1970. Due to the soon arrival of F-104 fleet by 1960s and the passage of major aerial combats between ROCAF/PLAAF, these F-100F were usually served as the trainer jet for pilots, CAP and ground attacker thanks to its sufficient performance for main island operations. However, due to a transporter crash in 1979 that costed almost all F-100 engineers in ROCAF and consecutive crashes involved the fleet of F-100s, they were soon phrased out by the last squadron that operated it by 1984, likely been replaced by later series F-104G or CKD assembled F-5E by AIDC.
