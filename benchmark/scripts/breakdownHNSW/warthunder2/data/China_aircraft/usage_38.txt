Usage of IL-10_(1946)_(China): 
NS-23 cannons are incapable of destroying medium or light tanks, even with AP ammunition. This severely hinders the aircraft's ground attack capabilities, so it is best utilized as a multipurpose aircraft similar to the B7A2 Ryusei. However, it is worth noting that this aircraft wields the ability to carry a varied payload of both bombs and rockets. With proper aim, it is possible to destroy heavy tanks, albeit it is very difficult as there is no bombing reticule. The "air targets" belt for the 23 mm cannons can demolish soft ground targets such as armoured cars and AAA units, but also retains the ability to destroy fighters and bombers alike with only a handful of rounds. Therefore, it can be beneficial to first attack the enemy's light defences and then if a teammate has been forced to a lower altitude by a pursuer, attempting to alleviate the stress of that pilot can be beneficial. Like the La-9, the IL-10 (1946) has the ability to fire two of its 23 mm cannons instead of four, as the ammunition pools are separate. A good strategy is to use one set of 23 mm belts for attacking ground targets, and the other for destroying enemy aircraft.
