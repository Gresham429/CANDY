Usage of P-40E-1_(China): 
At the start of the match, climb to the side somewhat and gain some altitude. If using MEC, turn up the propeller pitch to 80-90% and open the radiators fully. When using WEP, the engine will overheat even with fully open radiators if the prop pitch is increased, but it can run hot for a while without taking damage. If the situation is safe and the engine needs to be cooled, ensure that the radiators are open and dial down the prop pitch and throttle. The P-40E-1's poor climb rate can be frustrating, but considering its poor high altitude performance, climbing to around 3,000 m or slightly higher should be enough.
