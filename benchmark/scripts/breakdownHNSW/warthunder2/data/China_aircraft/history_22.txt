History of SB_2M-103U_(China): 
The SB2M entered service in 1934 and was used as a bomber in multiple conflicts. Although historically Sino-Russian relations (ROC and USSR at the time) were not good, right after the invasion of Japanese, on 21st August 1937, the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact (中蘇互不侵犯條約) was signed for supplies of weaponry from the Soviet Union; the Tupolev SB bombers were among the equipment received. The first batches of them were received in Lanzhou (蘭州, now the capital of Gansu Province) by the 1st Squadron, National Revolutionary Air Force (later ROCAF); these bombers were used in the first bombing operations against the Japanese in early 1938 along with Soviet Voluntary Air Force on Taipei's Songshan Airfield. There were also later deliveries to the NRAF in 1939 and 1940 which joined some of the major battles against Japanese forces. Spare parts for the SB also became the basis for the "XB-3" (轟研三式轟炸機) domestic design, but structural issues hindered further development.
