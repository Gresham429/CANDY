History of P-40E-1_(China): 
The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk was a US monoplane fighter designed in the late 1930s. A derivative of the P-36 Hawk series of fighters, the P-40 featured an inline engine and a fairly streamlined construction. While it suffered from poor high altitude performance, it proved to be a rugged platform with good high speed manoeuvrability. Maintenance and manufacturing were easy as well. Despite having a reputation as a substandard fighter, historical records suggest that the P-40 was quite effective overall, and it gave many Allied nations a fighting chance until newer and more advanced designs were available.
