Description of F-100A_(China): 
The ␗F-100A Super Sabre (known as the 超級軍刀機 in ROCAF) was an early variant of the famous "Super Sabre". In Taiwanese service, it received a number of upgrades to bring it up to par with later models from the USAF, replacing the vertical stabilizer and avionics to F-100D standard. Compared to the fighter-bomber F-100D, it has a smaller wing with a straight trailing edge, fewer hardpoints, and no flaps. It also has an early J57P7 engine that produces less thrust than the D model's J57P21. The speed and acceleration remained comparable since the F-100A weighs less. Due to the end of major aerial combats of the Taiwan Strait Crisis, the jets were usually used during main island CAP flights or training missions; although still being a valuable supersonic fighter in ROCAF fleet, after a severe loss of maintenance crews in a plane crash in 1979 (of which most of the crew were those who had received training for F-100 maintenances), lack of spare parts, and 3 consecutive crashes involving F-100s, these jets were quickly withdrawn in 1984 and replaced by the F-104G and F-5E.
