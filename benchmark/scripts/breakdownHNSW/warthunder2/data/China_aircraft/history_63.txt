History of F-5E_(China): 
Earlier in 1968, the Nationalist Government had proposed an agreement to Northrop to produce their latest F-5E/F Tiger II domestically in Taiwan. While the batches of earlier F-5A Freedom Fighters joined ROCAF in 1965 as the replacement for the already obsolete fleet of F-86s, those 48 F-5A series were then handed over to the RVAF in 1972 while some batches of USAF's F-4 Phantoms II were transferred from US Pacific Air Force and stationed in Taiwan; the aforementioned agreement with Northrop was signed in February 1973 where AIDC received the license for building 100 F-5E/F series under "Project Tiger Peace 虎安計劃".
