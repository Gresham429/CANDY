Description of J-8F: 
The J-8F (Chinese: 歼-8F型歼击机; unified NATO codename: Finback 长须鲸) was the final combat variant of the J-8 series interceptors, built by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC, 沈飞) from remaining J-8II airframes or by upgrading previous J-8Ds in the mid-2000s. The project traces back to the J-8C (or J-8III) project for domestic avionic upgrades for J-8II: although the unreliable WP-14 engine ruined the whole project, the radar systems were tested rather successfully and marked the completion of a domestic pulse-Doppler radar. By the end of the 20th century, the plans for Project 12 (PL-12) were also on schedule for domestic ARH AAM. Thus the placeholder aircraft, J-8H, with a new radar joined the PLAAF with PL-11 SARH, while the J-8F with a modified radar based on the former radar and new NATO-equivalent FCS main bus was finalised by 2005 and became a cornerstone of the PLAAF until new interceptors replaced them from June 2022.
