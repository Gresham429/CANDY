Usage of A-5C: 
Although historically an attack aircraft, the A-5C is not a first-rate ground attacker in Air RB since its bombload is still not impressive compared to other jets at its battle rating. It cannot destroy a base with its four 250 kg/500 lb bombs, but this is still an option for supplementary research points: stay at low altitude, rush to a base, drop the bombs, then head towards the center of the map to join the furball. Going after AI ground vehicles with the bombs and rockets can also be successful provided that other jets do not arrive quickly to crash the party. The Type 130 HE rockets can also be unloaded into a base for additional points.
