The ␗Ki-43-III ko Hayabusa(Falcon), with Allied codename of Oscar, represented the captured Ki-43 by National Revolutionary Air Force. After the total outbreak of 2nd Sino-Japanese War, IJAAF deployed their Ki-43 in Mainland China. Used by the 64th Air Squadron, the Ki-43s were able to score some victories on Sino-US forces during their deployment. Later in April 1942, the Chinese Expeditionary Force (中國遠征軍) captured a Ki-43-Ic which has been flown by Yasuda Yoshito (安田義人). After the end of war, ROCAF obtained the remaining Ki-43s in China, mostly at Nanjing as the supplement fighters before new US-built fighters joined them. They were decommissioned in 1946 while the Communist forces captured eight Ki-43s at Northeastern China and been used as trainer aircraft like many other captured Japanese fighters.[1]
