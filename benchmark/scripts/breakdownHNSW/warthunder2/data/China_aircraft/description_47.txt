Description of J-4: 
The J-4 (known in Chinese client as MiG-17 米格-17) represented the batches of MiG-17 brought from Soviet Union before they were locally produced as J-5 (歼-5). As part of the 156 Key Projects, Soviet Union confirmed to license MiG-17 to Factory 112 (SAC) in 1953; the complete technical drawings, 2 MiG-17, 15 CKD kits and parts for around 10 jets were then delivered to Mainland China in 1955. The first of these jets took off to the skies in 1956/7/19 as the first jet Mainland China has assembled and soon joined PLAAF with some victories over ROCAF during the heat of Taiwan Strait Crisis. While it soon became the very first prey of AIM-9B on 1958/9/24 with Wang Zizhong (王自重) becoming the very first victim of AAM in combat history, MiG-17 and J-5 still served PLAAF humbly for more than 4 decades before later jets like J-6/7/8 eventually replaced them alongside with the MiG-15bis still in PLAAF service. Some of these jets were also aided to North Korea, Viet Cong and Albania etc., with KPAAF being the only known user up to this date.
