Description of V-12D: 
The V-12D was the other variant of the Vultee V-1 airliner which was then converted into attackers used by NRAAF. After the deal of V-11 for the Nationalist government and the total outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the government purchased the newer V-12 series with an upgraded engine and slightly better armaments to further strengthen the air force against the Japanese forces; due to the blockade of Chinese waters and sparse on information, there were only 3 to 4 of them ever made it to Mainland China as SKD kits for Chinese aircraft factory after they retreated to Yunnan. Some of these parts were soon shipped to the British Raj (India) but no further records of any of these aircraft ever assembled or served in battles.
