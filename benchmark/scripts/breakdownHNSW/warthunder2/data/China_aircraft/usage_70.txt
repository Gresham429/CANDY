Usage of J-11: 
Although PLAAF deemed Su-27SK, aka J-11 as the main composition of PLAAF in 1990s and early 2000s, they did have plans to introduce the more advanced domestic avionics to replace the OEM equipment. As for J-11, although it has flawed avionics with inferior RWR and unreliable radar, the sheer payload and maneuverability can make it a great alternative to ROCAF's F-16A in air battles while retaining sufficient but less advanced means for ground attack operations.
