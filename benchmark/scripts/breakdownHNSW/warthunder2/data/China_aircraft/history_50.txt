History of H-5: 
The Harbin H-5 was the Chinese-produced version of the IL-28 'Beagle', a Soviet-designed light bomber used by a variety of countries in the Soviet Bloc.[1] Initially entering service in 1967,[2] the aircraft had several changes compared to the original IL-28 including redesigns of the wing and tail structure. Multiple variants of the H-5 were developed, including nuclear weapon carriers, electronic warfare aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft.[2] The last bomber-variant H-5s were retired in the early 1990s, though it is speculated that some airframes are still in use today in secondary duties.[1]
