History of DB-3A_(China): 
Due to the rather sparse information on DB-3 bombers, these aircrafts were very likely the result of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact (中蘇互不侵犯條約); 24 or 30 of these aircrafts were then aided to China and has been stationed in Chengdu Taipingshi (太平寺; now a PLAGF Aviation Corps and PLAAF airbase), Sichuan with the 8th Wing.
