History of J-7D: 
By the time the Type 62 and subsequent J-7I/II series went into commission with the PLAAF in the late 1960s, the PLAAF was already seeking a new fighter for all-weather interception and to replace earlier jets in service. Although the J-8 program was also started around the same time, it was only until 1979 when J-7II was finalized and J-8I was passed for certification. This also called for a back-up for the J-8I series. During the late 1970s economy reform and increasing international arms trade with foreign countries, Chinese engineers visited countries with MiG-21MFs in service and took the design for future use; CATIC also exchanged some Soviet equipment from Egypt including MiG-23SM and MiG-21MF as the reverse-engineer subject for new interceptors.
