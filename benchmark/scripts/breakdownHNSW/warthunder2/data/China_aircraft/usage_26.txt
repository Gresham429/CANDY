Usage of P-47D-23-RA_(China): 
In Simulator & Enduring Confrontation, bulkier planes that suffer in AB & RB shine and that of course includes the P-47D-23. This plane is a great learning platform for new EC players since in Sim, the P-47 has great control handling, fast speed, and a wide range of additional armaments of bombs, plus the original 8 x .50 cals, meaning it is an excellent multi-role aircraft. However, comparing to the later Jugs with all-clear bubble canopy, the razorback P-47 has worse visibility. The front have quite some frames around the gunsight, but they are thin which is a good news. The sides are overall unaffected. The rear view, however, is greatly obstructed by the razorback, preventing the pilot from seeing what's on the tail which can be fatal.
