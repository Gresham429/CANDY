Usage of V-12D: 
V-12D is a significant upgrade over the previous V-11, sharing a very similar flight performance. The new engine, with nearly twice the engine output as the V-11, gives the V-12D better general flight characteristics (climb, acceleration, cruising speed, etc). It is labelled as an attacker (strike aircraft) as well so it will have an air respawn. For most of the time, avoid dogfights and keep away from SPAAGs to maximize the odds of survival. For self-defense, the dead-angle under the belly is now covered by another .30 M1919 machine gun. But in dire, its average turn rate is still sufficient to do last-ditch dogfights against heavy interceptors. One small yet significant change is the replacement of the quad .30 cal MGs with a pair of nose-mounted .50 cal MGs, which have the option to load the highly potent M8 API round, making air-to-air combat a more viable last-ditch option as they will set anything important on fire with enough well-placed shots
