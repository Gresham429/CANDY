History of Q-5A: 
The Nanchang Q-5A 'Fantan' was the first variant of the Chinese ground attack aircraft, which has seen over 50 years of continuous service.[1] Developed in the early 1950s as a replacement for ageing Soviet-made IL-10 attack aircraft, the plane was developed from the MiG-19 airframe. Though it entered service relatively late due to the effects of the Cultural Revolution, it still saw extensive service as the primary attack aircraft of the Chinese Air Force. As well, it was exported to several countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Though it has now been retired from active Chinese service, the aircraft remains in service with the Myanmar Air Force.[1][2]
