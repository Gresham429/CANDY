Description of Shenyang_F-5: 
The Shenyang F-5 represents J-5s sent as military aid to the Korean People's Army Air Force from Mainland China. After Mainland China and the Soviet Union signed aiding treaties for the construction of Chinese's aviation industry in 1951, Factory 112 (State Songling Machinery Factory; now Shenyang Aircraft Corporation) was selected to be the factory to introduce the MiG-17F to Mainland China in view of the already obsolete performance of MiG-15bis. By November 1953, the license was issued to the factory. Before the deadline of National Day 1956, the first Chinese-assembled jet, J-5 (aircraft no. ä¸­0101) made its maiden flight on July 19 and soon passed state certification in September 9, with 4 of them joining the PLAAF 10 days later. As one of the frontline jet fighters, the J-5 scored numerous victories against ROCAF and USAF while losing some of them during aerial combat, including the first victim of the AIM-9B. Some of these jets were also aided to Chinese allies of the time who also scored some victories against their enemies, especially by the North Vietnamese forces.
