Usage of P1Y1_mod._11_(China): 
In Arcade battles, the light payload is somewhat countered by the ability to reload. It is recommended to use the plane to hit high-value targets such as pillboxes since it is limited to two bombs (though it is one of the few Japanese medium bombers able to carry 2 x 500 kg). Other planes with larger numbers of 60 kg bombs are better suited for taking out tanks and soft targets. It is at a huge disadvantage when compared to planes such as the B7A2, which has forward cannons able to strafe soft ground targets while bombs reload. As such, most pilots would use the B7A2 over the P1Y1, though this plane may still be useful in one's lineup for use after the B7A2 has been lost.
