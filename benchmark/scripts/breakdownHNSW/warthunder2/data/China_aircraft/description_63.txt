Description of F-5E_(China): 
The ␗AIDC F-5E(commonly referred as the  F-5E老虎II式戰機) represented the few remaining F-5E in ROCAF service since 1980s as part of their plan to enhance the combat capabilities against the growing PLAAF. Before the plans to introduce the F-4 series failed as the result of a better Sino (Mainland China)- US relationship, the Nationalist government signed contracts with Northrop to assemble the F-5E/F on Taiwan Island in 1973 to replace the some of the previous F-86F/F-100 fleet under their Project Tiger Peace (虎安計劃). After 6 batches of these aircraft were assembled and the plans to upgrade them perished by early 2000s, they have been one of the cornerstone of ROCAF until 2020s when 2 fatal incidents accelerated their decommission from the remaining fighter wing of ROCAF where their performance is hopeless against the now-modernized PLAAF, as well as the inferior ejection systems that costed 4 lives in these 2 incidents; the remaining (R)F-5E are waiting for the new T-BE-5A Brave Eagle AJT to replace them by mid-2020s.
