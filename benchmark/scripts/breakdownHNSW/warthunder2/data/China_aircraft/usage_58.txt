Usage of Shenyang_F-5: 
The Shenyang F-5 can be summarized as an energy-specialized variant of the Soviet MiG-17. The Shenyang F-5 is heavier, thus its instantaneous turn rate is moderately worse than the MiG-15s and the MiG-17s. However, when facing these aircraft, you can take advantage of your afterburner thanks to which this plane has better sustained turn rate at medium and high speed than both the MiG-17 and MiG-15. You should not turnfight these opponents or other planes like the Sabre series in most circumstances, instead, you should keep the fight strictly vertical. You have a far better climb rate, far more thrust than any MiG-15, -17 or CL-13B, therefore you can dictate the fight with relative ease. While you try to attain your altitude advantage, be aware of the Angle-Of-Attack (AoA) the MiG-15 and 17 can still pull, you most likely will have to dodge 1 or 2 firing solutions, then you will be out of harm's way, given you don't make a critical mistake. Turn this altitude advantage into an energy advantage to decide how and when to engage an enemy.
