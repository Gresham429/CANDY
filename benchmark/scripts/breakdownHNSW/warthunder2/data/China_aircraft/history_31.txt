History of Ki-61-I_otsu_(China): 
Some Ki-61s were deployed in China as interceptors during US bombing raids over Japanese home islands, including against B-29 Superfortresses. They were operated by 59th Sentai, who also operated Ki-27s, Ki-43s, and Ki-100s in China and Manchuria. After the war, both ROCAF and PLAAF operated captured Ki-61s, though documentation is scarce and only a few photos are extant.
