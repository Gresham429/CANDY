History of H-81A-2: 
The H-81A-2 is one of the export versions given to the ROC through the American Volunteer Groups sent to China. The volunteer force was sent by US president Franklin Roosevelt to deter Japanese aggression during the Second Sino-Japanese War. At the time these aircraft were a relief for the Chinese aid as the aircraft they were using at the time, primarily I-16s and I-15s, did not compete well against the Japanese air force. The only unit of these volunteer groups to actually see combat against the Japanese forces was the 1st AVG, otherwise known as the "Flying Tigers". Some records suggest that when building the aircrafts made for China, Curtiss employed leftover materials and components, making the aircraft more similar to the P-40B instead of the C variant, which was the one to be exported. For example, some of this aircrafts lacked internal membranes for self sealing fuel tanks, and instead relied in external self sealing coating. They also lacked regular features of the P-40C, like the external drop tanks, the additional armour for the pilot and radio equipment. It also did not help that the ROC decided to buy this aircraft without many essential components, like wing guns and reflector gunsights.
