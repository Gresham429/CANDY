Usage of F-100A_(China): 
Air Battles
The F-100A is an early supersonic jet. Its speed, acceleration, and high speed handling are not the greatest for its battle rating, where it often faces much more advanced aircraft, but it does have lethal weapons and enough good qualities to get by. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of its opponents.
