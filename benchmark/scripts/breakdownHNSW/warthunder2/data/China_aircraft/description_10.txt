Description of V-11: 
The V-11 was one of the earliest attacker aircraft of NRAAF (Nationalist Air Force) before the 2nd Sino-Japanese War; the Vultee Aircraft Inc. designed an "airliner", V-1 for US domestic markets, however, the new regulations on airliners put a full stop to any further production of this airframe at only 25 aircraft. Meanwhile, the USAAF bought a few aircraft and converted them under the name YA-19, which proved to be inferior to its twin-engine competitors and only used in Panama. For countries that were in dire need of new attack aircraft, namely China; the Nationalist government bought 30 aircraft and planned to assemble most of them in China Proper at Zhejiang or Guangdong, although they were flown by mercenary pilots and having minor results during the early days of war to bombard Japanese-occupied infrastructures, due to the worsening of war and crashes after the retreat, they were soon decommissioned by 1940.
