Description of Q-5L: 
The Q-5L (Chinese: 强-5L型强击机; unified NATO Codename: Fantan) was one of the final versions of the Q-5 family developed in the early 2000s, focusing on improving the electronics for ground-attack capabilities. China had been closely observing the USAF's guided munitions since the Vietnam War, during which their AGM-62 Walleyes performed exceptionally well in attacking critical infrastructure to stall attacks from the Viet Cong. Due to political turmoil, the PLAAF failed to acquire foreign targeting pods, so testing of domestic LGBs and guidance pods began in the 1990s with various prototypes. Although the plan for a 2-plane formation, where one plane would carry bombs and the other a target pod, was abandoned, the new avionics of the Q-5II (Q-5C; suffixed with L when upgraded) and Q-5D (suffixed with N) ensured the capability of the single jet to strike enemies with LGBs. These upgrades became the standard for the Q-5s before their ultimate decommission in the early 2010s.
