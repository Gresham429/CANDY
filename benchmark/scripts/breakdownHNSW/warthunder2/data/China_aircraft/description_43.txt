Description of F-86F-40_(China): 
The ␗F-86F-40 Sabre(known as 軍刀機 in Taiwan and ROCAF) represented the later "blocks" of F-86F delivered to ROCAF since mid-1950s under the MAP military aids to upgrade their obsolete fleet into jet era. Although these jets had scored a few victories against PLAAF jets, the most notable victory was on 1958/9/24 when a ROCAF pilot used the freshly-arrived AIM-9B during the battle, shooting down a MiG-17/J-5 and claimed the very first AAM kill in combat history. These jets served ROCAF for another 2 decade until F-100A, F-104 and F-5 eventually replaced all subsonic fighters in ROCAF in 1977, marking the end of subsonic era of ROCAF.
