History of Tu-4_(China): 
It's known that at least twelve Tu-4s were aided to People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) by USSR since 1953, making China the only Tu-4 operator outside of the USSR. Ten Tu-4s delivered by the end of 1953 were operated by the Fourth Independent Regiment of PLAAF and later, in 1960, two additional aircraft were aided and served as navigational training aircraft; Tu-4 were saw during the riot-suppression operations over the Tibetan Plateau as a gunship and the Sino-Indo Border War, and sometimes bombing the frozen Yellow River to reopen shipping routes.
