History of Gladiator_Mk_I_(China): 
On the 7th July 1937, fighting broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War. When the war began the Chinese air force was using many obsolete aircraft and so, in October 1937, the Chinese government decided to order 36 Gladiator Mk Is from Britain; at the time these were the most modern fighter aircraft in use by the Royal Air Force.[1] The disassembled Gladiators arrived in Hong Kong in late 1937, before then being shipped to Guangzhou for assembly. The Gladiator entered service with the Chinese air force in February 1938; it first saw combat on 24th February, when pilot John 'Buffalo' Wong Sun-Shui shot down two A5M fighters (Japan's best fighter aircraft at the time).[1] The Gladiator was well-liked by Chinese pilots, however with the emergence of more modern Japanese fighters, and a lack of spare parts to support the aircraft, the Gladiators were soon relegated to use as training aircraft only.
