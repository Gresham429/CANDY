History of P1Y1_mod._11_(China): 
In order to stop the US naval Task Force's offensive towards Taiwan and Okinawa, the Imperial Japanese Army and Naval aviation corps launched a campaign named "Operation Sho", later developed into the Formosa Air Battle off the eastern coast of Taiwan in October 1944. Japanese air power suffered great losses in terms of experienced airmen and aircraft during the battle. Japanese military also lost control of the skies over Taiwan. As a result, US air forces began to launch frequent strikes over Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Okinawa. In an attempt to reduce the damage caused by these continuous air raids, and to maintain the combat capability of Taiwan-based air units, the Japanese Army and Naval aviation corps decides to evacuate and scatter their units all over Taiwan. It was to save strength for the "Final Battle of Greater East Asia" and turn Taiwan island into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier". The Japanese Naval Aviation corps reorganized the units stationed in Taiwan at the beginning of 1945. The Second Tainan Naval Air Group was disbanded and reorganized into the 765th Naval Air Group on February 5, 1945. The reorganized Air Group was mainly equipped with P1Y1 "Ginga" bombers and D4Y1 "Suisei" bombers. Since the supposedly cutting-edge "Ginga" bomber failed to score any major battle results before the defeat of Imperial Japan, Japanese airmen often have sarcasm against the Ginga, that it was an useless masterpiece: "the country was war-torn but Ginga was not" (「国滅びて銀河あり」).
