History of La-9_(China): 
Although the Lavochkin La-9 (NATO codename: Fritz) didn't make it into World War 2, and came into commission during the downfall of propeller fighters in 1946, it was sold to various Soviet allies before the latest jet fighters could make their appearance, including the newly born People's Republic of China in 1949.
