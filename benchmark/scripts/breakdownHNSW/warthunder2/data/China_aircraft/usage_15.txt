Usage of P-66: 
At the start of a match, climb and gain some altitude, at least a few thousand metres. Sideclimbing is recommended to avoid getting jumped by high-flying opponents early on. Do not try to climb to great heights since this would take a while and the engine will not perform very well there. Keep an eye out on the battlefield and look for enemies. If things are quiet, the P-66 can serve admirably for attacking bombers and attackers due to its good protection and firepower. If enemy fighters are nearby, stick with teammates and look for an opening to engage. For newer pilots, it is easier to go after enemies that have a significant energy disadvantage or are distracted. Be careful when picking fights and avoid extended horizontal or vertical manoeuvres. If the engagement becomes unfavorable, consider acting as bait and leading opponents towards teammates.
