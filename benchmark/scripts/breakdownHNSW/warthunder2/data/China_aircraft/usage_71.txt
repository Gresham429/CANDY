Usage of JH-7A: 
The JH-7A vastly upgrades the arsenal of the PLAAF/PLANAF with its great selection of bombs and self-defense IR AAMs, as well as its great manoeuvrability thanks to its aerodynamic design and powerful turbofan engines. While pilots will need to be careful of the aircraft's sheer size and poor low-altitude manoeuvrability, most of the time both ground and aerial targets will have quite a bad day facing a well-piloted JH-7A.
