History of D.510C: 
In the late 1930s during the expansion of the Nationalist Air Force and in view of the invasion from Japan, the Nationalist Government sought for supplementary fighters before US-built aircraft could be imported as the orders were delayed. During a visit to Europe in May 1937 (for the accession of George VI), France approved the sales of 34 D.510C along with around a dozen other French aircraft on credit; but by the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, only 24 those D.510Cs had been delivered to the Nationalist forces and the remaining ones were either cancelled by the French Government or by the Governor of French Indochina. They were known as the "地機" ("Dì jī": Dewoitine) and made into service by late 1938 with pilots from Britain and France.
