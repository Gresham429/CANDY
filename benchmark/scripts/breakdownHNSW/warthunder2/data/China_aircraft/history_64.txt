History of J-7E: 
The CAC J-7 Fishbed (alternatively called a Fishcan to differentiate from the Soviet built ones) has entered PLAAF service since late 1960s, but due to the political turmoil and lack of documents due to Sino-Soviet split, it was not until the mid-1970s until the J-7II had a steady pace of manufacture. The 4th major revision of this airframe, J-7IV, aka J-7E, can be traced back to the 1980s.
