Description of Tu-4_(China): 
The ␗Tu-4 (commonly known as 图-4轰炸机 in Chinese; or by its NATO Codename Bull 公牛) was one of the earliest strategic bomber of the PLAAF acquired from the Soviet Union as a birthday gift for Chairman Mao Zedong when 10 of them flew to China on his birthday in 1953 as the demand for bombers to take the remaining lands from Nationalist forces arose. Although they have not been used on outbound missions, they have been one of the cornerstones of the PLA during the assaults on the Tibetan Plateau thanks to its good high-altitude performance and excellent firepower against rebels with US-made M2HB which caused havoc to the previous Tu-2 fleet. One of the Tu-4s was then converted as an anti-aircraft gunship to hunt down ROCAF recon planes in the 1960s and one was experimentally converted to the very first AECWS in Asia, KJ-1 with upgraded engine and new radar for early-warning. These bombers were retired in 1988 due to being obsolete and the production pace of H-6 series went smoothly after the manufacture flaws and difficulties have been solved.
