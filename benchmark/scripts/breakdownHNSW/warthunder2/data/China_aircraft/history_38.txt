History of IL-10_(1946)_(China): 
After its introduction in 1944, the IL-10 proved itself as a ground attacker even during the arrival of the jet era, due to the inferior low-altitude performance of early jets. Meanwhile, in Mainland China, the ongoing civil war between CCP and KMT for control of the nation was almost over (main KMT forces retreated to Taiwan Island and the remaining were struggling on different coastal islands like Kinmen and Matsu). During that time, the PRC only had propeller aircraft and before the outbreak of the Korean War, the PLAAF needed new aircraft to flush out remnants of KMT forces from the Mainland's coastal islands.
