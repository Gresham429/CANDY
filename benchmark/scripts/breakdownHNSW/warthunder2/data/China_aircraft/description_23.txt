Description of P1Y1_mod._11_(China): 
The ␗P1Y1 mod. 11 "Ginga" ,aka Frances in Allied codename or by its Japanese name Ginga (銀河, lit. Galaxy), was the captured twin-engine bomber from IJNAF used very briefly by the ROCAF by the mid-1940s. As part of the defence deployment of Japanese islands and the colony of Taiwan in 1944, IJNAF deployed numbers of P1Y1 in Tainan as the main composition of bombers defending their soon-to-crumble empire; however, the bomber didn't achieve any significant victories against the US forces and was soon abandoned on the Taiwan Island alongside with other Japanese aircraft. Before the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War, ROCAF had to source their fleet from abandoned Japanese aircraft from both Mainland China and Taiwan Island, these 12 remaining P1Y1 became one of the bombers of ROCAF before more reliable US-built bombers replaced them as soon as 1946; according to the records in Taiwan, these aircraft were soon dismantled alongside with hundreds of Japanese aircraft to minimize the risk of armed riots or revolutions against the Nationalist government on Taiwan Island.
