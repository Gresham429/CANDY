History of B-25J-30_(China): 
As one of the production blocks of the North American B-25J (-1, -5, -10, -15, -20, -25, -30, -35), the B-25J-30 was a natural upgrade of the B-25J-25. Incorporating many modifications over time, the aircraft replaced the stainless steel s-shaped exhaust with enamelled 1020 steel stacks on cylinders 1, 7, and 9 and beginning with AF S/N 44-31111, provisions were made to adapt the mounting of a chemical tank within the bomb bay and on S/N 44-31311, an electric C-6 Type bomb hoist was added to the bomb bay. Later on, S/N 44-31338 began the addition of T-64 Zero-Length Rocket Launchers carried under the wing, giving the aircraft a capability of carrying up to eight five-inch High-Velocity Aircraft Rockets (HVAR), and starting with S/N 44-31491, M-8A gun mounts and a K-10 Computing Gun Sight was added to the tail position, strengthening the position as a whole.
