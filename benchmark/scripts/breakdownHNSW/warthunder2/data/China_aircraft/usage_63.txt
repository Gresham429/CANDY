Usage of F-5E_(China): 
Like its tech tree predecessor and its American counterpart, F-5E was designed to be a lightweight and inexpensive option for countries with tight budgets. This version of ROCAF's F-5E is identical to US ones with new avionics and engines to retain its combat capability against possible enemies. While this might sound good at first glance, players have to consider for a major problem- the waves of SARH/ARH capable jets at 11.0; you will either face waves of Sparrows or even worse, waves of Phoenixes from F-14A; for lightweight jets exactly like F-5E,  facing such missiles alongside their carriers will be the ultimate nightmare to deal with. Players have to survive the first wave of head-on attacks at the first place in order to take revenge on enemy targets. Although only a pair of AIM-9P and M39A2 cannons are available for air-to-air missions, if used at the right moment ie. a careless or slow enemy, 2 missiles are more than enough to score some hits. If it has to join a dogfight, the high ammo count at its tier can give trigger-happy players more opportunity to shoot down enemy aircraft, even multiple targets if aimed properly. But do note that a pair J85-GE-21A still aren't something with high thrust, any severe energy loss gives players very little chance to even regain the speed, making it easier to be shot at.
