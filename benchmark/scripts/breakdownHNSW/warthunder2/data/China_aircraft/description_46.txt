Description of J-2: 
The J-2 represents the MiG-15bis in PLAAF service during the Korean War; MiG-15s were supplied to the PLAAF (as the PVAF) during the war to defend Mainland China from USAF bombings as well as intercepting air threats over the skies of now-North Korea. Although having some losses, some PLAAF pilots also marked their names in the history books by either shooting down enemy aces or becoming an ace themselves. These jets served in the PLAAF for another decade before the licensed domestic-built J-5 replaced them in the 1960s.
