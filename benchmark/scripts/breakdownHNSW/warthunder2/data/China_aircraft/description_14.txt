Description of D.510C: 
The D.510C , aka "地機" ("Dì jī": Dewoitine) to Chinese pilots, was the 24 D.510 series delivered to the Nationalist Revolutionary Air Force by 1938. During the visit of European countries after the accession of George VI in May 1937, Nationalist government seek for new fighters to supply the NRAF before the total outbreak of 2nd Sino-Japanese War, which France later approved the sales of 34 fighters to NRAF but only 24 of them could ever made it to China before the blockade of sea and land borders by Japanese forces. Piloted by European and Chinese pilots, D.510C only contributed very little to the resistance efforts for the NRAF before these aircrafts eventually replaced by Soviet and American fighters by 1941.
