Description of J-7D: 
The J-7D (Chinese: 歼-7D型歼击机, AKA J-7IIIA 歼-7IIIA; unified NATO codename: Fishcan) was an upgrade of the previous J-7C (J-7III), which was based on Egyptian MiG-21MFs with domestic avionics and HUD. The PLAAF obtained MiG-21MF aircraft from Egypt, and due to the slow progress of the J-8 development program and the need for interceptors to counter potential Soviet threats, there were plans to replace the J-8II series with a reverse-engineered variant. Although the development of the J-7D was successful and showed improved performance in some aspects, the J-8II program and the introduction of the Su-27SK Flanker-B (and its licensed CKD/SKD variant, J-11A) to the PLAAF limited the demand for the J-7D, resulting in only a few orders being placed to utilize the prebuilt airframes.
