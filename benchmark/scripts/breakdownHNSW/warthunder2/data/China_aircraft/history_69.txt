History of J-8F: 
By 1986, there were plans to upgrade the already obsolete J-8II with completely new domestic avionics, in parallel to the Sino-American Peace Pearl (和平珍珠) program in 1984 to upgrade the jet with US/NATO avionics during the better days of Sino-American relationship. Soon after 1989's national-wide riots and the subsequent crackdown in the capital city of Beijing, although Grumman could still continue the project with SAC, due to the rise of budgets and difficulties to purchase NATO avionics after sanctions, the Peace Pearl was eventually cancelled. While the new variant, known as J-8C or J-8III was added to the schedule as Chairman Jiang Zemin (江泽民; 1927/8/17-2022/11/30) approved for the development of the 争气机 (lit. The Good-Show Jet; note: the term 争气 means to earn credits in terms of honour) at 1990/10/31 as the domestic alternatives to the Project 10 (J-10) and Su-27SK Flanker-B. There are two major features of the J-8C: Shenyang Liming WP-14 Kunlun turbojet engine and NRIET Type 1471 PD radar; although early test flights with the modified J-8II prototype airframes were like sailing on fair sea, the crash of two prototypes (one due to ATC miscommunication; one due to onboard fire) were already more than enough to give a death sentence to the project. After the successful test flights of the J-10, and an increase in the fleet of Flankers both from KnAAZ and SAC's J-11A, the project was eventually ditched by 2001. While the Kunlun bit the dust, the Type 1471 radar proved to be rather successful and set the cornerstone for future domestic radars. This was where the story J-8F begun.
