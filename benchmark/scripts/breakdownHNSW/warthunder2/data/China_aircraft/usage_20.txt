Usage of A-29: 
Being a light bomber, the A-29's most preferred tactics is to dive into enemy base and quickly release its payload. Due to the plane's weak structural integrity, however, care must be taken to prevent overspeeding and ripping your wings in the process. While the frontal .30 cal machine guns is not so useful in a dogfight, you can still use it to strafe AI-controlled planes and soft ground targets for extra credits.
