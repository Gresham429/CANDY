Usage of J-8F: 
Like its predecessors, the J-8F is designed to be a high-altitude interceptor that utilize ranges of missiles, especially radar-guided missiles; but due to avionic changes on J-8F, the only missile of such type is the PL-12 which is yet to introduce in future patches. This also eliminates the option to use earlier PL-11 or Aspide-1A SARH AAM from earlier variants of J-8II (J-8B, D and H). For the time being, the only two options are both IR missiles, PL-5B and PL-8. Still, the overall manoeuvrability is still surprisingly good for such a huge jet and retained the similar flight envelope of the late MiG-21 series (MF or bis). To make the best out of the J-8F, unless in dire situation or 1-vs-1, use the J-8F as an interceptor instead of a fighter where its sheer size will be a huge plus for enemy guns to land upon the airframe, ruining the aerodynamics of the jet or being shot down right away.
