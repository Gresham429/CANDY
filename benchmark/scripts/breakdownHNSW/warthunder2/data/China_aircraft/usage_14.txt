Usage of D.510C: 
Like its French cousins, players can utilize the high firepower and good manoeuvrability of the D.510C to take down enemies at lower altitudes; your 20 mm cannon with 60 rounds will certainly make very short work of interwar fighters with very little protection, sometimes even bombers will fall victim of the autocannon given trigger-control is utilized. However, players do also have to be aware of the insufficient speed against later aircraft which could fly up to 500 km/h, as well as its overall unprotected airframe that any shots landed near the cockpit will have the chance to take down the pilot with ease. Unless going for last-ditch options, never head-on against anything that has more guns than D.510C or having run out of cannon shells. The 7.5 mm machine guns might sometimes shine during dogfights, but not when heading-on enemies.
