Description of H-81A-2: 
The H-81A-2 was an export version of the P-40 Warhawk, very similar to the P-40C, these aircraft were exported to China and flown by the Flying Tigers (American Volunteer Group). These models were not very liked by their pilots, they lacked drop tanks for extra range, bomb racks on the wings, their engines were very vulnerable in combat to leaks and overheating and the base version had no radios, so improvised radio transceiver were installed. The plane also had a very poor performance at high altitudes and a slow climb rate. The aircraft was not liked by ground crews either, lack of spare parts and components were common and many damaged aircrafts stayed on the ground for years without flying. However, even though it was less agile than the Japanese fighters, its heavy construction and strong airframe were very well liked among pilots, the pilot had a decent amount of protection from bullet impacts and the airframe could withstand emergency landings.
