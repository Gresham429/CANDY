Usage of Martin_139WC: 
As a bomber, the Martin 139WC does the job well. It can easily reach bombing points before interception and can damage a base with two 250 kg bombs, and can then turn away and return to base to rearm. If enemy fighters are at altitude, consider using clouds for cover, or entering a shallow dive towards friendly fighters, or the airfield.
