History of J-7II: 
The Sino-Soviet split, which began in the late 1950s, led to a period of chilled relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The most modern fighter aircraft in the inventory of the People's Liberation Army Air Force was the MiG-19, purchased from the USSR. While an effective fighter at the time of its introduction, rapid advancements in fighter jet development lead to new aircraft like the MiG-21 capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. Around 1960, plans were underway for MiG-21s to be license produced in China, but negotiations broke down and Soviet advisors were pulled from the country, leaving the fate of the project in question. A few years later, Khruschev unexpectedly approached Mao with an offer to sell the MiG-21 and its technology. This deal went through and several MiG-21s, parts, and associated documentation were delivered to China. However, it was discovered that the documents were incomplete. In order to manufacture them properly, the MiG-21s were thoroughly reverse-engineered, and a number of improvements were made in the process. The finished product of this effort was firstly named a Type 62 Interceptor (62式歼击机) then later a J-7 (歼-7), mostly identical to the original MiG-21 F-13 (NATO: Fishbed; the Chinese variants are sometimes called a Fishcan to differentiate from Soviet-built ones).
