Description of CW-21: 
The CW-21 was a fighter interceptor based on the CW-19. Intended to be a high altitude fighter with good climb rate and good armament, it caught the interest of the Chinese government. China received 3 fully built CW-21s and 27 kits to be armed. Another three were sent to China and given to the Flying Tigers group. Other variants of the CW-21 were developed, like the CW-21B, which was used by the Dutch in an effort to modernize their air force. However, after the defeat to Germany, these aircraft were given to the Dutch East Indies. The CW-21 ended up being an easy prey to the Japanese fighters, and their lightweight construction meant that cracks and structural failures were more common than in other planes.
