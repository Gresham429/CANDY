Description of J-8B: 
The J-8B (Chinese: 歼-8B型歼击机) and known by its nickname "Mr. Handsome in Air" (空中美男子) or NATO codename of "Finback", was one of the cornerstones of PLAAF before the 2000s that was developed from a revised design of the previous J-8I series with nose intake and inferior avionics. The jet was developed in early 1980s to compete with its intended foe: MiG-23 Floggers with overall superior performance to the first series J-8. However, the results of war in the Middle East proved J-8II should be aimed for even tougher enemies like F-16A, thus the prototype was planned for upgrades that could only be achieved by early 1990s with 1960s-equivalent avionics. These were the Block 2 of J-8II with a slightly upgraded radar for serial production and have served PLAAF for a decade until they were upgraded to later variants with new avionics, one of these jets also played a major part in the ongoing Sino-American conflicts and left its name in the pages of history.
