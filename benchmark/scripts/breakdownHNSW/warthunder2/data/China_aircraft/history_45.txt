History of MiG-9_(l)_(China): 
The Korean War saw the very first major battle between the East and the West as well as between jet fighters. Mainland China was involved in the 3-year conflict against the UN forces. One major problem for the newly-born PLAAF was that they had no jet aircraft. During the mid-1950, the Nationalist forces and the USAF would often perform air raids to major cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou and the new capital of Beijing. Between August 1950 to January 1951, the Soviet Air Force transferred 13 fighter divisions to defend these cities, with 9 of them equipped with MiG-9s. This was the very first time Mainland China got their hands on jets and later they decided to purchase some MiG-9s from the Soviets as well, both the PLAAF and the Soviet Air Force expected the MiG-9 to be sufficient enough to handle USAF jet fighters.
