Description of F-86F-30_(China): 
After the end of the Korean War, many American F-86 Sabres were placed into surplus reserves. After more advanced fighters came into service, US Sabres were then exported to various other countries. The Republic of China was one of the many countries that received a large number of Sabres. The RoC received over 300 F-86Fs and a significant number were upgraded to the F-40 standard. Sabres and MiG aircraft would soon duel again. In the late 1950s, the Chinese Communist mainland and the Nationalists fought and many dogfights ensued. RoC Sabres had relatively good success against the MiGs and would soon receive the new AIM-9 Sidewinder; a guided missile that could home in on heat sources.
