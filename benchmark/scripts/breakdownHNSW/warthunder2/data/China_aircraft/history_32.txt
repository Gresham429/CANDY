History of Mosquito_FB.Mk.26: 
The Mosquito began life in a more than shaky start. In 1936 the Ministry issued Specification P.13/36 that stated a twin-engine bomber that could carry a payload of 3,000 lb for 3,000 miles while having a maximum speed of 275 mph. It was also stated that it should also carry 8,000 lb at shorter ranges. Geoffrey de Havilland sent a letter to an Air ministry council member Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman stating that a high-speed bomber could be made out of wood and powered by RR Merlin engines as there would be a shortage of strategic metals in a war. However, Freeman replied that it would fall short of the specification by either bomb load or speed both of which were important.
