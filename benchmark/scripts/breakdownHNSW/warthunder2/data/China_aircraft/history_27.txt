History of P-47D-30_(China): 
Thunderbolt pilots flew into battle with the roar of a 2,000-horsepower radial engine and the flash of eight .50 calibre machine guns. This combination of a robust, reliable engine and heavy armament made the P-47 a feared ground-attack aircraft. U.S. Army Air Forces commanders considered it one of the three premier American fighters, along with the P-51 Mustang and P-38 Lightning. The United States built more P-47s than any other fighter airplane.
