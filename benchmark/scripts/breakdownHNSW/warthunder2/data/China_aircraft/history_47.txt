History of J-4: 
The usage of the designation J-4 is unclear, though most western observers claim it was applied to either the MiG-15 or MiG-17.  One theory suggested that J-4 was the Chinese designation of the MiG-15bis, though this was later debunked when it was found that the J-2 was in fact a 15bis model.  The most likely theory (and the one followed in-game) is that the designation was applied to imported Soviet-built MiG-17As, while license-built MiG-17Fs were designated Shenyang J-5 (F-5).
