Description of DB-3A_(China): 
The ␗DB-3A(known as 德勃-3轟炸機 in Chinese) represented the 24/30 DB-3 bombers aided to China in June 1939 alongside with other Soviet bombers like SB; the aircraft was perhaps more well-known to Chinese during major bombing runs on Japanese-occupied Wuhan Wangjiadun (王家墩) airfield which the bombers scored more than 100 aircrafts and hundreds of Japanese aircrews in September and October 1939. The aircrafts were likely been used by the Nationalist forces or Soviet volunteers until the aircrafts were eventually replaced by newer, larger bombers like B-24 from USAAF.
