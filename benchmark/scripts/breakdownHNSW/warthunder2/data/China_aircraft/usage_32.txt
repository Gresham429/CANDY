Usage of Mosquito_FB.Mk.26: 
The Mosquito is one the best multi-role planes in the game due to its many redeeming aspects even at its high BR. The Mk 26 is at home as both a ground attack aircraft and a heavy fighter with the ability to easily switch roles in battle. Firstly, the plane packs a devastating punch with the quad 20 mm and can snipe pretty well due to its nose-mounted guns. This makes it a brilliant anti-bomber aircraft, especially with rockets. It is also decent against other heavy fighters, but never expect an easy fight (although the same could be said for the enemy). It can outrun a Bf 109 G-6 at low altitude, although this doesn't mean you should always avoid using it as a fighter. With its rockets or 500 lb bombs, it can deal with 2 pillboxes while the cannons with ground ammunition can kill light pillboxes and medium tanks from behind, and the MGs can then tear up soft targets making it an awesome ground attack aircraft. The only real major downside is that the flight model and weapons profile match that of the series 1 Mk VI Mosquito. This means that the engines and the payload are both worse (less powerful Merlin 21 engines instead of the 25, and no external bomb storage) than what they would be if this was the series, two models, instead.
