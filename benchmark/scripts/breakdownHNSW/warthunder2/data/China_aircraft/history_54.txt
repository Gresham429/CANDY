History of J-6A: 
The People's Republic of China received considerable military and technological assistance from the Soviet Union for most of the 1950s. Significant quantities of jet fighters, including the MiG-9, MiG-15bis, MiG-17, and others were purchased to modernize the nation's otherwise haphazard and antiquated air force, which at the end of the Chinese Civil War consisted of assorted captured American and Japanese aircraft. Production licenses were secured for the MiG-17 and MiG-19, and these two aircraft models were produced as the domestic Shenyang J-5 and Shenyang J-6.
