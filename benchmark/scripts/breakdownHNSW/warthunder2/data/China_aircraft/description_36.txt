Description of La-11_(China): 
The La-11 was among the last propeller fighters ever built, as a result of requirements of the VSS (Soviet Air Force) for long-range escort fighters. They were introduced into the PLAAF as supplementary forces alongside the La-9 before the introduction of new jet fighters. Although the La-11 achieved the first propeller-versus-jet kill for the PLAAF (as the PVAF), they were also part of the infamy where they shot down a civil flight in mid-1950s. The remaining aircraft served for another 2 decades before lack of spare parts brought them to their ultimate end of service.
