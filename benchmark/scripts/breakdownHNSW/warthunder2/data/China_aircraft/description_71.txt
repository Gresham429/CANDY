Description of JH-7A: 
Due to the advent of the latest US and Russian strike aircraft projects of the time, such as the F-15E and the Su-34, China quickly realized their Q-5 fleet was technologically behind. Building a new supersonic heavy strike aircraft was no easy task, especially for China which had started the program lacking the required technological advancements to complete it. The development program began in the late 1980s as China aimed to bolster its naval aviation capabilities. This twin-engine, two-seat fighter-bomber was designed by the Nanchang Aircraft Corporation and later upgraded by the Xi'an Aircraft Corporation. The initial variant, the JH-7, first flew in 1988. It was equipped with a variety of systems, including the JL-10A radar and various electronic countermeasures, making it a versatile platform for ground attack and maritime strike missions. The JH-7 program faced many challenges, but by 1992, the first serial production variant of the JH-7, the JH-7A, officially entered service, where it played a significant role in modernizing China's naval air forces and showcasing their ambitions in the world of military aviation. While not as famous as other strike aircraft of its era, the JH-7 series is a noteworthy example of China's incredible strides in defense technology.
