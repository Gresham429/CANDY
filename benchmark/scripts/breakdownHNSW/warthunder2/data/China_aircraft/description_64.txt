Description of J-7E: 
The J-7E (Chinese: 歼-7E型歼击机; unified NATO codename: Fishcan) is a heavily-modified model of the MiG-21 series and one of the current support fighters of the PLAAF. The design of a double-delta J-7 was demanded not only by foreign customers, but also by the PLAAF themselves, where the jet would be the replacement of the bulk of J-6s in PLAAF service by late 1980s, as well as a way to earn foreign exchanges to fund the Project No.10 (J-10). Although being quite obsolete in today's standards, the jet is still rather cheap to operate and equipped with relatively advanced IR AAMs to deliver sudden strikes on foes, as well as a makeshift "lead-in" trainer for pilots before they operate newer jets.
