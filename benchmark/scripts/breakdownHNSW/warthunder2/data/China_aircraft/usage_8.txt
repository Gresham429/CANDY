Usage of I-153_M-62_(China): 
The I-153 can be used in turnfighting, bomber intercepting and ground-pounding. It is excellent in turning tightly and continuously, and it has lovely low-speed handling and a low stall speed (unlike the I-16), making it a great starter plane for simulator battles. However it does have its drawbacks: the rather big nose blocks the visibility a lot, offering very poor over-the-nose visibility which is a disadvantage in a turn fight, because when leading a shot the enemy will always get obstructed by the engine, making the player guess the shot. Also, its upper wings will get in the way when you look aside.
