History of Hs_123_A-1_(China): 
Although Hs 123 performed the earliest CAS tactics in war history during the Spanish Civil War, the aircraft itself was far too obsolete by the late Interwar period and its successor, Ju 87 joined Luftwaffe; for China during the 1930s, any aircraft would be very valuable assets for the newly-formed NRAF in view of the menacing Japanese forces in Northeastern China. As US-built aircraft have yet to be delivered, there were plans to purchase from another source, namely German in this case.
