Usage of F-5A_(China): 
F-5A was designed to be a lightweight fighter at the first place, so one thing players may find is the better manoeuvrability over most jets at the same tier, also another traits of this aircraft is its directional controllability (that is, the nose points to whether your mouse pointed at without much corrections); but you will also suffer from a major drawback of it- the subpar thrust of the pair of J85 on the it from lower to medium speeds, which provides lower-than-average acceleration to fighters of the same tier at such speeds, unless necessary or 1-on-1 battles, DO NOT have the airspeed lower than 800kph which the speed drops even significantly.
