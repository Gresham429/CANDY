Description of Ki-84_ko_(China): 
The ␗Ki-84 ko Hayate, known as 疾風 (Hayate; Hurricane) in the IJAAF, or its Allied report name "Frank", represents a captured Ki-84 ko acquired by the ROCAF in 1945. After the commission of the Hayate in the IJAAF in March 1944, Mainland China became the first battlefield where the Hayate was used by some fighter regiments of IJAAF; thanks to its high altitude performance, these aircraft were used to protect Japanese infrastructure in Mainland China from the bombing runs of the USAAF and Nationalist Air Force; meanwhile, they were also manufactured by the puppet state of Manchuria. After the surrender of Japan in August 1945, ROCAF received numbers of Hayates scattered around Mainland China to strengthen the reborn ROCAF before USAF aircraft could be delivered. Communist China also adopted Hayates in Northeastern China as ground attackers and trainer aircraft for pilots before the PLAAF was officially established in 1949.
