Description of Q-5_early: 
The Q-5 early (强-5型强击机; NATO codename: Fantan), also known as the Eagle 302 project, was the first series of Q-5 attackers produced from 1969. It was developed after the PLAAF captured some coastal islands from the Nationalist forces and observed the effectiveness of the IL-10 attackers in air-land operations. However, the propeller-driven IL-10 was outdated by the late 1950s, when the PLAAF had acquired supersonic jets like the MiG-19 and its license-built version, the J-6. The PLAAF approved a design for a jet attacker based on the MiG-19, but with a side intake, called the Dongfeng 106. The design process was delayed by the economic difficulties during the Great Leap Forward and took ten years to complete. The final Q-5 model was accepted by the PLAAF in 1969 and remained in production until 1979, with 515 units built. The Q-5A variant replaced it in 1983.
