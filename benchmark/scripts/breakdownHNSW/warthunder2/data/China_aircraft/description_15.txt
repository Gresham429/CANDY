Description of P-66: 
An American fighter designed in the late 1930s, the Vultee P-66 Vanguard was originally intended to be delivered to Sweden in 1941. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbour, the US decided to retain the aircraft for defense and training of its own personal. When better aircraft became available, the P-66 was sold to China in large numbers, serving in the 3rd and 5th Air Groups of the Chinese Nationalist Forces. At the end most of these fighters were replaced by the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk in 1943, but some of them survived and were used in the Chinese Civil War against Mao's forces. Compared to its Japanese counterparts such as the Ki-43 and Ki-44, the P-66 lacked the agility to survive in prolonged fights, and thus it was forced to do hit and run tactics, using its better top speed to outrun Japanese fighters when they moved to intercept.
