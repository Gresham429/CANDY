Description of A6M2_(China): 
The A6M2 Mod. 21 (Commonly known in Chinese as 零战21型) was captured on multiple occasions by both the Nationalist and Communist forces during and after WWII respectively. This model likely represents the 2 aircraft, numbered V-172 and V-174, that were captured after force-landing on the Leizhou Peninsula in 1941 - the very first Zekes captured by Allied forces - and served as examples to evaluate this fighter just before the outbreak of the Pacific War.
