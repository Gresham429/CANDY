History of JH-7A: 
As Mainland China has already developed domestic attacker, namely the Q-5 series from Nanchang, there were already needs for a land-based naval aircraft for ship attacking operations i.e. Q-5Yi (强-5乙), probably the very last torpedo bomber ever designed. Soon after the Sino-Vietnamese (with RVN) conflicts of 1974, PLAN found a major piece of puzzle lacking for their South China Sea composition: an attacker capable of launching AShM for standoff operations while able to fly supersonic; while PLAAF also called for a new supersonic attacker to replace the H-5 fleet against the menacing Soviet forces. Thus Chinese military commands listed their requirements for the new attacker by 1976 where the CMC called for a new jet for both aviation forces under the same airframe and capable to defend itself from enemy interceptors while maintaining sufficiently high payload; with Chen Yijian 陈一坚 in lead, XAC was approved for the new bomber on October 1977, while the requirements were also given to SAC and NAMC respectively (note from editor: CAC was working on the J-9 program led by Song Wencong 宋文骢, future chief engineer of J-10), leading to a "civil-war" and probably the very first competition of aircrafts between Chinese manufacturers.
