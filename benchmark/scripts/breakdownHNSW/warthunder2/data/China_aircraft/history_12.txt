History of Martin_139WC: 
Although the Martin B-10 was made obsolete in late 1930s when Boeing's B-17 won the bid for a new long-range bomber, the overall performance of the B-10 was still sufficient for countries in dire need for high-speed bombers, including the Republic of China which had next to no aviation industry at the time.
