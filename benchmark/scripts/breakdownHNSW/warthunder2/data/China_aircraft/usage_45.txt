Usage of MiG-9_(l)_(China): 
The MiG-9 (l) requires altitude to be most effective in either of its two main roles. While flying full throttle into the middle of the map may seem like the noblest thing to do, it may end your piloting career faster than you care for, not allowing you to reach your full potential during the match. Best bet for this fighter is to start side climbing on the map or working on gaining altitude away from where the main group of aircraft are flying as this provides you with a relatively safe area to climb and allows you to see any enemy aircraft which may be gunning for you and give you enough time to respond or dive away. It is important to begin your side climb flying straight until the fighter reaches speeds of about 500-550 km/h when the climb angle can be increased to about 15Â°.
