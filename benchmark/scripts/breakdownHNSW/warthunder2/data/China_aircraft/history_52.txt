History of F-100A_(China): 
In the early Cold War era, the Republic of China Air Force was equipped with US jet aircraft like the  F-86 Sabre and  F-84 Thunderjet, which were used in clashes with the People's Republic of China over the Taiwan Straits. Amid growing conflict in 1958, a number of assorted F-100 Super Sabres were delivered to Taiwan, including the F-100A, the two-seat F-100F, and the reconnaissance RF-100A. The former were upgraded with a number of features from the latest F-100D, such as a taller vertical tail fin and wiring for Sidewinder missiles. Another batch of F-100s was delivered in the 1970s and the type remained in service until the 1980s.
