Description of P-38L-1_(China): 
The ␗P-38L-1 Lightning, dubbed by Chinese soldiers or locals as the 雙身機 (Double-body aircraft), represented the P-38L used by 14th Air Force albeit painted in Nationalist delivery (which in fact flew the recon version, F-5E instead of the combat variants; most of the resources suggested that Lightnings were first painted in Nationalist delivery, then modified to unarmed  F-4 and F-5E recon planes). The P-38 series have already been the nightmare of Imperial Japanese forces since their introduction thanks its unique design, large combat-radius and devastating firepower; it was also the very aircraft that got Isoroku Yamamoto alongside with his officers in 1943. Some P-38s from USAAF were then transferred to bases in China to escort bombers for bombing runs to the Japanese-occupied Taiwan, as well as credited as the recon which helped the delivery of the only two A-bombs ever deployed in combat history. By the time near the Korean war, a Nationalist pilot hinted the existence of Soviet and Chinese MiG-15 by 1950 at the cost of his life; after the shot-down, ROCAF soon phrased-out the P-38 series with US-aid jet aircrafts by 1953.
