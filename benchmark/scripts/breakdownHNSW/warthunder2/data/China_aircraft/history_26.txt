History of P-47D-23-RA_(China): 
The record for the "Razorback" P-47D series (pre D-25-RA) in Chinese service is rather sparse due to a lack of differentiation of its sub-variants in most sources; the earliest users of these P-47D were by the 14th Air Force, USAAF with their deployment in the CBI Theatre in 1944. The USAF serial number site recorded the earliest variant would be D-15-RA which had a few losses over China skies. In the case of the D-23-RA series, there were only records for 7 of them which were later transferred to the ROCAF in April 1945.[1] These likely served in the ROCAF as the few special ones among all 102 P-47D received by ROCAF, but no further records exist of P-47D-23-RA during the Chinese Civil War about their usage and their fate.
