Usage of CW-21: 
The CW-21 should be mainly used as a fighter. Excelling in turns, acceleration, with hard-hitting guns, it is very easy to dogfight other planes at its battle rating. Your main composition will sometimes be biplanes and some biplanes can out turn you. However, the CW-21 against monoplanes is where it really shines. It can easily out turn other planes like the He 100 or even the He 112 which is crucial in a dogfight. The CW-21 does not have any close air support potential other than knocking out light targets like anti-aircraft artillery and armoured vehicles, so the main targets will be other planes.
