History of PB4Y-2_(China): 
Amid the ongoing Sino-Japanese War (抗日戰爭), USAAF had deployed dozens of B-24D in Chinese soil for strategic bombing operations against Japanese-occupied areas. Later in 1943, ROCAF got their hands on a few of those B-24Ds from 14th Air Force; although this would have to delay until 1944 where ROCAF finally has enough crew for the bombers, but this time B-24Ms.
