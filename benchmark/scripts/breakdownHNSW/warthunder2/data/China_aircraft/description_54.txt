Description of J-6A: 
The J-6A (Chinese: 歼-6甲型歼击机; Type 59 Interceptor 五九式歼击机 before new naming), sharing the NATO codename of "Farmer" with its Soviet counterpart since it was a licensed build of the MiG-19 series, was the main fighter jet of the PLAAF since the early 1960s. As the first country to build supersonic jets in Asia, the J-6 and its different variants were in service with the PLAAF for nearly 4 decades before they were finally replaced by new jets. Although already deemed obsolete by the time the F-104 and MiG-21 series joined their respective air forces, the J-6 scored some victories over the ROCAF and US(N)AF against their jets and drones, as well as overseas victories by other users. The jet also served as a platform of different prototypes, and was the predecessor of the Nanchang Q-5, with 60% of the parts interchangeable.
