Description of PB4Y-2_(China): 
The ROCAF received PB4Y-2s to replace the diminishing amount of B-24s in service. They saw active service well into the '50s over Mainland China, and multiple Liberators were shot down. One ROCAF Liberator was lost to a Burmese Hawker Sea Fury, and the aircraft was later phased out in the early '60s as they became obsolete.
