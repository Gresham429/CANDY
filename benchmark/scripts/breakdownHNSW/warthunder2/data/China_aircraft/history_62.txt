History of F-5A_(China): 
As a supersonic fighter born in late 1950s, Northrop F-5 series fighters were a popular choice for many countries, as well as being a famous star in USAF's Exercise Red Flag, where it performed well even against 3rd generation fighters such as F-14 Tomcat. Although the US Air Force only used a limited number of F-5C "Skoshi Tiger" in the Vietnam War, both F-5A "Freedom Fighter" and F-5E "Tiger" were involved in many wars and conflicts around the world, such as the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, in which one of the Iranian F-5E fighter jets shot down a MiG-25 flown by an Iraqi ace pilot with the M39 autocannons!
