Usage of Ki-84_ko_(China): 
The strong rate of climb of this fighter allows for a significant altitude advantage to be made in the beginning of battles. As this fighter is usually paired with the Soviets against the Japanese, make sure to utilise this advantage as your Soviet teammates and many of the Japanese fighters that you will encounter will be unable to climb as high as you. However, if German aircraft are present in the opposing team be cautious of climbing too high as they will be able to easily gain an altitude advantage over you.
