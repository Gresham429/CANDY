Description of Ki-45_hei/tei_(China): 
The ␗Ki-45 hei/tei Toryu , known to the Chinese forces by the name 重战 (Heavy fighter), was the captured Ki-45 series in Northeastern China by the Communist forces by the end of WWII. IJAAF deployed some quantities of Ki-45 to Northeastern China to defend their assets in the area, most notably their steel mill; as well as the last-ditch weapon against Soviet forces near the Chinese borders. 3 of these Ki-45 in different variants were eventually rebuilt into a single aircraft for evaluation and teaching, leaving them practically useless during the later Civil War.
