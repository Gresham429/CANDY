Description of Saab_J35XS: 
The J35XS was part of a deal between Finland and Sweden so that the last one could provide Finland with different variants of the J35 Draken. At the beginning only second hand J35Fs, Bs and Cs were provided with minor modifications but Finland requested an upgrade variant of the J35F, more comparable to the J35J standard. Thus the J35XS was conceived, it had better countermeasures, electronics, a better radar (but still very similar), more weapon pylons and access to the RB-27 and RB-28 missiles, as well as the RB-24J (AIM-9P). A total of 12 aircrafts were produced of this variant, and was the only one assembled in Finland, while the kits were produced in Sweden by SAAB. In real life, the J35XS was also able to fire the Soviet R-13M1 (export variant of the R-13M) that was extensively used by Finland in their Mig-21s.
