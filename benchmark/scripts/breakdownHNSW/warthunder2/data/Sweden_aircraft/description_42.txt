Description of Vampire_FB_52A_(Sweden): 
Finland operated a very small number of FB 52A Vampires during the early Cold War. A total of 6 units were acquired from the United Kingdom in 1953 and they were nicknamed "Vamppi". Later, nine T.55 twin seat trainers were acquired in 1955. The aircrafts served with the 1st and 2nd Air Wing before being retired in 1965 in favour of more capable fighters.
