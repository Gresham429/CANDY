Description of J26: 
Due to Sweden's proximity to the war, several P-51s made emergency landings at Swedish airfields. Out of the many that did land, a few were selected and put under Swedish service, but at this point, Sweden was still neutral. However, as the war neared its end, Sweden thought they would become involved in the war and bought 50 P-51Ds. These new Mustangs would be classified as the J26. Sweden later bought more Mustangs due to the slow development and roll-out of their own homebrew aircraft, the SAAB-21. Sweden had over 140 Mustangs until more advanced aircraft replaced them. Many J26's were sold off to other countries like Israel and Nicaragua.
