Usage of J29A: 
The J29A, also known as the "flying barrel", is armed with 4 x 20 mm Akan m/47C cannons that perform well, but still lack a bit of a punch for a fighter. The J29A has a good top speed but acceleration is not the quickest. Once it has built up speed it can catch most enemy jets that it will face, but something that will help it greatly in doing so is having an altitude advantage to dive on the target to get that extra acceleration to hunt down targets.
