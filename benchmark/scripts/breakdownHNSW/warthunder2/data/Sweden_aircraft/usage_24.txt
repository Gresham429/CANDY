Usage of T18B: 
Speed and altitude are your best friends when flying the T18B-1, as you must keep both up in order to ensure your survival. You may be fast, but you are not invincible, as there are many aircraft at the BR that will easily catch you such as the P-47D, P-61, Bf 109 F-4 and the I-185 twins. However, you can easily turn the tables on your would-be attackers by forcing them to stall then shred them with your impressive forward armament.
