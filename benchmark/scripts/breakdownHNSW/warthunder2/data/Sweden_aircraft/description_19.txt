Description of Fokker_D.XXI_(Sweden): 
The ▄Fokker D.XXI was designed by the Netherlands in 1935. It was meant to be a cheap and compact fighter, it served for both the Luchtvaartafdeling (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force, some aircraft captured by Germany were actually placed in service with the Luftwaffe. The Fokker D.XXI was first used in combat by the Finnish Air Force during the 1939–1940 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. The D.XXI was the successor to the D.XXI-3 in Finnish service, the only difference is the armament, with the D.XXI featuring 2 x Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which was necessary after becoming increasingly obsolete during the Winter War. During the Continuation War, the Fokker was surprisingly effective, with some Finnish pilots even becoming ace fighters on it with the top scoring ace being Jorma Sarvanto. Finland continued to operate their D.XXIs until 1949, and classified them as surplus to requirements in 1952.
