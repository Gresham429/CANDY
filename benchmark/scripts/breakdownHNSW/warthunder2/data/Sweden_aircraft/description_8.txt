Description of B3C: 
The B3C, originally built by the German aircraft firm Junkers as the Ju 86, was developed in the mid-1930s alongside rival Heinkel's He 111. Since the Luftwaffe were not officially allowed to build bomber aircraft at the time, the main purpose of the aircraft was to be a ten-person airliner which could, with minimal effort, be converted into a medium bomber. The Ju 86 was developed in the mid-1930s with diesel engines, but they proved unreliable in combat during the Spanish Civil War. The Luftwaffe replaced them with BMW 123 radial engines, and also exported the Ju 86K to Sweden and Hungary. Sweden used British Bristol Mercury engines instead, which were later license-built in Sweden and Poland.
