History of B18B: 
The B18B is a dive bomber variant of the Saab 18 bomber used by the Swedish air force during and after the Second World War. Initially designed to replace the older Ju 86 bombers in Swedish service, the Saab 18 series were capable of fulfilling fast reconnaissance, bomber and attack roles. The B18B was the second variant of the Saab 18 family after the B18A and served as a dive-bomber. The aircraft was later developed into the T18B, a dedicated attack aircraft, and served well into the 1950s before being retired.
