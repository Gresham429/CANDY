Usage of B3C: 
While many aircraft found in War Thunder are considered multi-role capable (fighter and interceptor, attacker and bomber, etc.), some aircraft sit within just one role, but have several subset capabilities within that role. The B3C is no exception as its sole role in the game is that of a medium bomber, however, it is capable of defining its mission objective, depending on the type of suspended ordnance outfitted.
