Description of J26_David: 
The J26 David was one of the 4 earliest examples of the P-51s the Swedish got their hands on. Initially, the P-51B-7, nicknamed "Hub", crash-landed in neutral Sweden after being engaged in German airspace and, like the other 3 P-51s that crash-landed in Sweden, were bought by the Swedish and evaluated for potential Swedish service.
