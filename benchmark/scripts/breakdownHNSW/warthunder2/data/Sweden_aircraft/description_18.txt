Description of M%C3%B6rk%C3%B6-Morane: 
The Mörkö-Morane was a Finnish modification of the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406. 30 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters were delivered by France in February 1940 and these fighters saw little to no combat during the Winter War. Germany later delivered more M.S.406 and M.S.410 fighters captured from the French. The Mörkö-Morane was the result of a series of modifications applied to all 41 M.S.406 in service, with captured Soviet Klimov VK-105P 12-cylinder engines and more available armament. The result was a much more improved M.S.406, however, deliveries were slow and the first example arrived in 1944. The aircraft still performed decently during the Continuation War, thanks in part to superior tactics used by the Finnish pilots.
