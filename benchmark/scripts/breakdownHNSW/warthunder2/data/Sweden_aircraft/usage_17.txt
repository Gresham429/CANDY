Usage of Hurricane_Mk_I/L_(Sweden): 
Due to your mediocre armament and poor flight characteristics, the Hurricane Mk I/L can be utilized as a support fighter. Due to the aircraft's decent speed at it's battle rating, you may use boom and zoom tactics or simple rate fights to gain an upper hand against your enemy. Do not engage in prolonged dog fights as you will quickly bleed your energy and your lack of aileron input is unable to keep up in a fight.
