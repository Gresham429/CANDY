Usage of J35A: 
Downtier: In a downtier, the J35A is one of the best planes in the match. With superior speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability, the J35A is almost unstoppable. Start off by climbing to around 20,000 ft (~6,000 m) and then levelling off to enter supersonic speeds, here you will have every advantage over your enemies, fire a missile or get close with your high top speed and take them down with your guns.
