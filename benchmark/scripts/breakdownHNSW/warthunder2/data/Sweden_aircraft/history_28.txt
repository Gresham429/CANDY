History of VL_Py%C3%B6rremyrsky: 
Pyörremyrsky, meaning hurricane, tornado or whirlwind in Finnish (pyörre > vortex/whirl, myrsky > storm), was the name of a Finnish fighter design at the end of WWII. Designed by Torsti Rafael Verkkola (1909-1977), the chief designer of Valtion lentokonetehdas (VL or "State Aircraft Factory") and the designer of the previous Myrsky fighter and the Pyry trainer, the Pyörremyrsky was conceived as a domestic equivalent to the Messerschmitt Bf 109G.
