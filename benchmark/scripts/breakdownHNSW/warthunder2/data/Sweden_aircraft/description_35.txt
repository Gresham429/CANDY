Description of J21RA: 
The J21RA was Sweden's first jet powered aircraft, built on the existing J21 series. The former planes had to be altered a bit due to issues that came with installing a jet engine and would encounter a few issues in the initial stages, but these would later be resolved. It would not be until 10 March 1947 when it would have its first flight. It was less than adequate in a fighter role, but would perform better in an attacker role. The Swedish air force would used these jets between 1949 to 1957, when they would later be replaced by the J29 and A28B.
