Description of MiG-21bis_(Sweden): 
In 1963, after rejecting a deal of MiG-19s in search for a new frontline fighter, Finland became the first country outside the Warsaw Pact to purchase the MiG-21, starting with MiG-21F-13s and building their long and prosperous relationship in purchasing Soviet aircraft. Their long service of the Fishbed would culminate in 1977, when Finland acquired 26 examples of the MiG-21bis airframe, specifically the Fishbed-N variant with the Polyot-OI guidance system instead of the Lazur system. These aircraft would remain in Finnish service until 1998, when they were replaced by the F/A-18C Hornet after the end of the Cold War.
