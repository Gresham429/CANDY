Description of J34: 
The Hunter Mk.50 (designated the J34) was acquired by Sweden in 1954, after being considered for an interceptor aircraft that would mainly attack bombers at high altitudes. The J34 could be considered as a stop gap while the J35 Draken was still in development. While the J29 Tunnan was the backbone of the Swedish Air Force, the Hunter was deployed around Stockholm to protect the capital from incoming bombers. It was given to the F8 and F18 air wings and, while it retained its standard armament, it was also armed with the RB24 air-to-air missile. The J34's biggest flaw proved to be its lack of radar, this meant successful interceptions could only happen in daytime and with clear skies (this probably motivated SAAB to give the J35 Draken all-weather capabilities). Sweden acquired 120 J34s; they started to be phased out in favour of the more modern J35 in the 1960s, being given to less prominent air wings like the F9 and F10 squadrons. The last J34 in service was retired in 1969.
