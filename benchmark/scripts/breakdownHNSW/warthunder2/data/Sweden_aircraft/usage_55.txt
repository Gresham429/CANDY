Usage of MiG-21bis_(Sweden): 
The MiG-21bis is fairly manoeuvrable at high speeds and since it accelerates quickly and climbs extremely well, it works well as an interceptor (take off, reach around 1,000 km/h, burst climb at a 20-25 degree angle up to 6,000 or 7,000 m and fire on anything that can be sighted) but this method has some risks.
