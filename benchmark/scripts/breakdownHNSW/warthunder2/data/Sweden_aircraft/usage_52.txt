Usage of JA37C: 
The Viggen is a simple and effective plane to use in realistic battles. You will notice on take-off it is a bit sluggish and won't accelerate very well, as it is heavy, but once you're above 700 km/h the thrust and aerodynamics help you accelerate better from here. The Viggen performs better compared to most fighters at lower altitudes (3,000 m and below) in terms of manoeuvrability and top speed. Taking advantage of your top speed, Pulse-Doppler radar and Skyflash missiles, you can be aggressive and hit the battle early and at low level to take out any attackers using your useful radar set with your SARH missiles.
