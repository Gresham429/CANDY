Usage of B18B: 
The B18B is a really good aircraft in all game modes. Its frontal armament is really powerful, using HEF shells. It does have a low ammo count of 300 for all guns, including the turrets. The B18B is a good bomber hunter, as you'll be facing He 111's which have such poor defensive armaments. You can easily destroy axis bombers with this plane. The G4M1 and He-111 don't hold a candle to this bomber. You can use this plane in all roles, even fighter. The list is below for realistic battles.
