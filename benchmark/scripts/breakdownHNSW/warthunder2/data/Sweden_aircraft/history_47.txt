History of A32A: 
The A32A Lansen was the initial ground-attack variant of the Saab 32 'Lansen' attacker / fighter aircraft. Designed to replace the obsolete propeller-powered Saab 18, the aircraft's design was influenced by late-war German aircraft designs such as the P. 1101, P.1110, P.1111 and P.1112. The aircraft featured a conventional low-mounted swept-wing with a sleek fuselage housing a two-man crew, while the later J 32 fighter variant had a single crewmember. The A32A was introduced in 1955 with a total of 287 aircraft built for the attack role, serving until the end of the 1970s.
