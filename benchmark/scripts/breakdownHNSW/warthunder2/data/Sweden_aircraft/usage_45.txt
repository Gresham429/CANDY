Usage of J29F: 
In Realistic Battles, the J29F is similar in playstyle to that of a MiG-15bis, while still sharing some similarities to the F-86F-25 Sabre. A J29F keeps energy very well when the afterburner is used, giving it a strong rate of climb and acceleration. This means the J29F can easily energy fight most enemies it encounters. However, the J29F should never be seen as a one-trick pony. When coming face-to-face against stronger and faster opponents, energy tactics can no longer be used. In that case, it can be better to use the superior turn- and roll-rate, to avoid incoming attacks from above. If missiles are researched, these enemies will most likely be forced to leave you alone since they have a hard time dodging the 10g pull of the Rb24.
