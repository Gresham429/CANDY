History of J11: 
The J11, also known as the Fiat C.R.42, is an Italian-made fighter that was bought and maintained by the Swedish Air force "Svenska Flygvapnet" in the late 1930's. As World War 2 broke out, the Swedish air force felt the necessity to increase its air defence and yet due to the ban on exporting weapons and war machines during the war the Air force was relying on older and less capable fighters. When Italy showed interest in selling the Fiat C.R.42 the Air force placed an order of 120 planes and named the aircraft "J11". While the plane was mainly used as a fighter, it could also serve as a scout/recon vehicle. During the war the J11 was already outdated and could not withstand the superior German fighters and it was made with poor quality forcing most of the aircraft to become scrap metal. Today, few stand unharmed or restored and are located in aircraft museums around Sweden.
