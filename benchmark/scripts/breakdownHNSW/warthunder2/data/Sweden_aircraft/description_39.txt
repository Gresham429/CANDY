Description of SK60B: 
The SK60 was developed for the Swedish Air Force after SAAB's attempt to develop a twin-engine jet aircraft for civilian and military use in 1959. After problems with decision making, it was decided to focus only on the military version of the aircraft. After a few years of development, the prototype first flew in 1963, with a total order of 150 units placed by the Swedish Air Force in 1964. The aircraft was known as SAAB 105, the aircraft was later modified for ground attack with 60 units receiving the new role, Austria later endorsed the SAAB 105, and ordered 40 units.
