Usage of A32A: 
In Air Realistic Battles, the A32A can make very effective use of its available bombs. The 3 x 600 kg mb m/50 bombs deliver 480 kg of explosive mass each, which is more than enough to destroy a base at its tier. Even though the A32A has mediocre acceleration, it can generally drop its bombs on at least one base, if sufficient at avoiding Su-7s and/or Harriers. From there onwards, it's recommended to either return to the airfield, or pick off targets using the tactic described below.
