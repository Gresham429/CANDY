Description of J29A: 
The J29A Tunnan is a single-engine jet fighter developed by SAAB in the late 1940s. One of the main design features of this aircraft is its swept-back wings, which were designed after SAAB acquired German documents from the war that proved that swept-back wings were necessary when trying to achieve higher speeds. The J29A also features a Swedish license-built version of the British de Havilland Ghost engine. The armament consists of four 20 mm akan m/47C, a license-built copy of the British Hispano Mk V, but with a lower rate of fire. The first prototype flew in 1948, and the aircraft then proceeded to enter service in the Swedish Air Force, Flygvapnet, in 1951. It remained in service until 1962 and never saw any combat use.
