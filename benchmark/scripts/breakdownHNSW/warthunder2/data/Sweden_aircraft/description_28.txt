Description of VL_Py%C3%B6rremyrsky: 
From 1942, the superiority of the Red Army Air Force over the Finnish was becoming increasingly obvious. While 160 modern Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2, G-6 and other versions were transferred to the Finnish Air Force by Germany between 1942 to 1944, the situation began to deteriorate among the Axis countries, and due to the increasing successes (especially from the second half of 1943) of the Allied countries, it became obvious that further deliveries of new Bf 109s as well as spare parts for them would become more and more problematic. In this situation, the command of the Finnish Air Force ordered LV to develop a fighter that was to be made of domestic materials (mainly wood and steel) with characteristics comparable to the Bf 109 G-6. Engineers T. R. Verkola, Arvo Ilinen, and Edward Vigelius proposed an aerodynamically clean low-wing aircraft equipped with a German Daimler-Benz DB 605AC, developing 1,475 hp (1,085 kW) and rotating a  three-bladed VDM propeller. In the project, the fairing of the propeller sleeve and the engine hood were borrowed from the German aircraft, which made the new Finnish aircraft, designated Py√∂rremyrsky (hurricane), very similar in front to the Bf 109 G.
