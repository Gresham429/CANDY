Usage of J21A-1: 
For pilots just beginning to learn this aircraft's flight characteristics, it is best used as a support aircraft, it is too slow to take into dives reliably and suffers from Yak-like rip speeds, without any of the benefits that the Yaks have in agility. For pilots with more experience, you can successfully push this aircraft to its limits and beyond and eliminate lesser experienced pilots in more agile aircraft or even other more experienced pilots through strong counter-manoeuvres.
