Usage of J22-B: 
Like many Soviet aircraft which were devoid of any turbochargers or superchargers, the J22-B is best flown between low altitudes and 4,000 m (13,000 ft). Any higher and this aircraft will struggle and be prey to higher altitude fighters which have the extra horsepower kick from these engine chargers. To effectively relate, flying above 4,000 m in this aircraft is akin to flying a stock aircraft in a normal situation, not as fast, not as manoeuvrable and not a powerful as it could be and an easier target for those aircraft which are.
