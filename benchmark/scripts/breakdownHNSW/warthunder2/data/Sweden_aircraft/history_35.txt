History of J21RA: 
The J21RA is a variant of the Saab 21R, a unique early jet fighter developed from the previous Saab 21. The aircraft was one of two semi-successful conversions of propeller fighters into jet fighters, the other being the Soviet Yak-15 (which was converted from the Yak 1/3/7/9 series). The aircraft served as one of the first jet-engined aircraft in Swedish service and was also the first jet-engined-aircraft produced by Saab. The Saab 21Rs were retired in the 1950s with the introduction of more advanced Swedish aircraft.
