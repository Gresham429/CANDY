History of J22-B: 
As World War started to break out in Europe in 1939, a nervous neutral Sweden watched as the Soviets attempted to advance on Finland and Germany amassing power and heading for France. Looking at its current air forces, the Swedish military realized their fighter aircraft, older Gloster Gladiator J 8 biplane fighters were largely outdated when compared to up and coming Bf 109s and early Soviet fighters like the I-301 (or later known as LaGG-3). With SAABâ€™s current production plant cranking out SAAB 17 reconnaissance/bombers with SAAB 18 bomber in development, no room, mechanics or design team personnel were available to spare for the development and creation of a modern fighter airplane for the Swedish Air Force.
