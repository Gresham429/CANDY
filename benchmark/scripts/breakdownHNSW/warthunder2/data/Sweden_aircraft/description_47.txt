Description of A32A: 
The A32A was designed and developed by the Swedish company SAAB. Development began in 1948 and it first flew in 1952. Deliveries to the Swedish air force, Flygvapnet, began in 1954. In the Flygvapnet, it was used as a ground-attack aircraft, being able to carry a large array of different bombs and unguided rockets as well as four 20 mm Akan m/49 cannons. It remained in service until 1978 but never saw use in combat. Powered by a license-built Rolls-Royce Avon engine, locally designated the RM5, it was able to break the sound barrier in a dive, thus becoming the first Swedish aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound.
