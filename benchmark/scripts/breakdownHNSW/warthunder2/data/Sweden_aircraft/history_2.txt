History of J6B: 
The J6B is a Swedish designed and manufactured biplane fighter from the early 1930s. It was the last biplane fighter to be designed in Sweden and the last version of its aircraft-model to be built. Its designer and manufacturer, AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning (The Swedish iron-works aeroplane department Ltd)(ASJA for short), acquired the base-model when they bought the company Svenska Aero AB (Swedish Aero Ltd)(SA for short) in 1932. Svenska Aero AB had designed and manufactured 3 previous iterations of the J6B during a 4-year period prior to their acquisition by ASJA in 1932.
