Usage of J35D: 
The J35D can be a bit "over the top" when it comes to in-game performance. The J35D doesn't underperform in any area, even when stock. Yet the J35D quickly suffers when facing several opponents at once. This is due to the incredible manoeuvrability the J35D possesses, which becomes its worst enemy in battles. The J35D comfortably dodges incoming enemies when at higher speeds, but quickly loses this advantage after the first few passes due to the reduction of speed. Avoiding can still be done easily, but high-load missiles require a speed above 800 km/h to be reliably dodged. To avoid the likelihood of a low-speed experience, the J35D should manoeuvre with caution, with the same style as a pilot preventing wings from ripping. The recommended way to use this trick is to control the elevators with the use of the "pitch axis" button. By tapping this button rapidly, a J35D pilot can prevent high-G manoeuvres while still keeping their backs cleared by looking behind them in a defensive-like approach. The amount of pulling can be varied depending on what is approaching the Draken. It's important to remember that aileron rolling can still be done without much consequence, and will come in handy when avoiding enemies in a defensive situation.
