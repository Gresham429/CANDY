Description of B17A: 
In the late 1930s, the Swedish Air Force was looking to replace their ageing Fokker S 6 biplane reconnaissance aircraft with a newer aircraft. Work began by ASJA and was designated as the L 10, however in 1939 after merging with Saab, the designation was changed to Saab 17. Though only serving for a few short years with the Swedish Air Force due to the advent of turbojet aircraft, the B17 continued to serve with other countries for another 20 years. The B17A was the first production variant of the Saab 17, it was also the one with most units built, at 132, it was powered by an Svenska Flygmotor AB-built STWC-3 (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-S1C3G Twin Wasp) radial engine. The powerplant had to be changed in the B17B, however the new engine was more reliable.
