Usage of J20: 
The J20 is excellent at turnfighting. It can out-turn most contemporary aircraft. It is not recommended to fight enemies head-on due to its weak armament of 2 x 12.7 mm Akan m/40 machine guns. Boom and zoom is not a great playstyle for this aircraft as its control surfaces lock past 500 km/h. The aircraft is not equipped with any suspended armaments, which makes it unfit to attack ground targets.
