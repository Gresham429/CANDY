Usage of SAAB-105G: 
The SAAB-105G is a very flexible multi-role aircraft, best used in the interceptor role at the beginning of an air match, then changing armament mid-match depending on the situation. Thanks to its airspawn and 2 x RB24 (Swedish AIM-9B) missiles, you can hunt down enemy bombers and heavy attackers before returning to base. Beware as these missiles have very poor tracking on targets doing anything more than flying in a straight line, so are best used on enemies who are too slow to manoeuvre or are otherwise unaware of your presence. Once you have spent the 2 missiles or there are no viable targets to use them on, you will need to return to base to rearm.
