History of VL_Myrsky_II: 
In the leadup to the Winter War, the Finnish military was hastily building up its fighting strength, including that of its air force. Despite it being clear that the demand for new aircraft couldnâ€™t be met by the limited Finnish aviation industry, the military nonetheless issued a set of requirements to the State Aircraft Factory in order to come up with a new design in early 1939.
