Description of J20: 
The J20 is a Swedish export variant of the Italian Re.2000 serie 1. The purchase of Re.2000 serie 1 aircraft was due to the US stopping the sales of any sort of military aircraft to foreign operators. Thus, Sweden acquired 60 units of the aircraft, with Hungary being the second biggest foreign operator. The J20's engine proved to be very unreliable, but it was still liked by its crew, thanks to its good flying characteristics and stable performance in Sweden's harsh conditions. During World War II, the fighter was used by fighter wing F 10 at Malmö and had the task of intercepting any aircraft that violated the neutral Swedish airspace. A single unit was shot down in 1945 intercepting a German Dornier Do 24 near Sölvesborg.
