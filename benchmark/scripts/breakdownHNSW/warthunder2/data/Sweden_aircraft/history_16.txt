History of B-239_(Sweden): 
At the beginning of 1939, Finland was looking to purchase modern fighter aircraft. They contacted the USA with the only demand being that the plane was already in service and had the ability to use 87-octane fuel. 44 F2A-1 Buffalo fighters intended originally for the US Navy were sold to Finland after the USN agreed to wait for the F2A-2 variant instead. Model B-239E was built with a more powerful Wright R-1820-G5 engine producing 950 hp as opposed to the 940 hp Wright R-1820-34 engine used in USN planes and featured mountings allowing installation of four machine guns instead of two on the American counterpart. The planes were also de-navalised, which meant they weighed less while having better performance.
