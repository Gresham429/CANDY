Description of J35A: 
The J35A was the first version of the J35, with a total of 90 units built between the two versions. The J35A1 (kort) had a short afterburner and a short tail. Meanwhile, the J35A2 (long) had a new afterburner with increased thrust, which meant that the tail section needed to be extended. While unexpectedly, this reduced drag, it forced the installation of a retractable tail wheel. The first batch produced in 1960 lacked gunsights and radar, which was a big mistake by the manufacturer, however, in 1961 the remaining units were delivered with the radar and gunsight installed. The J35 was the attempt by Sweden to create a domestic fighter that could replace both the J29 Tunnan and the J32B Lansen. Thus the J35 has many records, including being the first fully supersonic aircraft deployed in Western Europe.
