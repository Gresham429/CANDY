Usage of J21RA: 
Despite being jet-powered, the J21RA still performs best when played like a propeller driven aircraft. The airplane struggles to reach high speeds, and drops it fairly quickly when manoeuvring. So the best use of the new engine is to gain altitude. Although weak in performance compared to earlier jets, the J21RA is decent at climbing to altitude, and can very efficiently deal with targets thanks to the high agility offered at lower speeds. Although the flaps are designed for much lower speeds (similar to the J21A-2), the plane still performs similar to the propeller variant when turning, making them less desired than on other jets.
