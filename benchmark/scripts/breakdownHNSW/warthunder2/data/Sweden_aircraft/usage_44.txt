Usage of J29D: 
Although the J29D is a fast jet capable of reaching high speed, at the start it can be pretty slow. The J29D has the chance to fight supersonic jets at its battle rating which it can't hunt down by itself. As such, the J29D is best used in teamwork with other jets to either catch up to the enemy plane or make them do manoeuvres to bleed some speed so the J29D can catch up. If faced with subsonic jets, it can keep up with them and stay on its tail thanks to its manoeuvrability. For the daredevils, the J29D has an excellent armament of choice to do head-ons with. These load outs would be best put to use if no teammate around to help you fight the enemy. Because the J29D has slow acceleration at the start of the game, it can have a hard time intercepting enemies at first. As the battle progresses and you will have worked up speed, this task will be made much easier.
