Description of Fokker_D.XXI-3_(Sweden): 
The ▄Fokker D.XXI Series 3 was designed by the Netherlands in 1935. It was meant to be a cheap and compact fighter, it served for both the Luchtvaartafdeling (Dutch Army Aviation Group) and the Finnish Air Force, some aircraft captured by Germany were actually placed in service with the Luftwaffe. The Fokker D.XXI was first used in combat by the Finnish Air Force during the 1939–1940 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. The D.XXI-3 was a license built D.XXI-2 for Finland. The aircraft used the normal armament but was eventually fitted with 20 mm cannons. Against the Soviet Union, the aircraft was initially successful, but eventually it became underpowered and sustained heavy losses. During the Continuation War, the Fokker was surprisingly effective, with some Finnish pilots even becoming ace fighters on it with the top scoring ace being Jorma Sarvanto. Finland continued to operate their D.XXIs until 1949, and classified them as surplus to requirements in 1952.
