Usage of S17BS: 
The B17BS has two forward facing machine guns, allowing you to dispatch lone enemies or lightly armoured ground targets. With the option to load 9 50 kg bombs, the B17BS becomes a potent ground attacker for its battle rating. The pilot should not rely on this plane's manoeuvrability or speed. It is a slow and methodical plane that requires to gear down from faster and more potently armed planes. In arcade battles, the bombs allow for liberal aiming at specific targets, ideally columns of lightly-armoured vehicles. Having a bomb sight means you can stay relatively high without endangering yourself. Should an enemy attempt an attack on you, dive away as quickly as possible. You do not have the turn speed nor the firepower for head-on attacks. The rear gunner, especially if armed with armour-piercing bullets, might prove enough of a deterrent for fabric biplanes. If the enemy plane persists in its desire to shoot down the B17BS, evade the shots by wiggling around. The plane has a sturdy enough construction to resist rifle-calibre rounds and has the strength to withstand a few poorly placed 20 mm cannon shots. Overall, the plane is a serviceable light attacker.
