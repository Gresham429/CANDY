Description of J8A: 
The J8A was the service name adopted by Sweden for their Gloster Gladiator Mk II acquired from Great Britain. The first Gloster Gladiator was delivered to the Swedish Air Force on April 15th 1937 and locally designated as the 'Jaktplan 8' (J8). While the first few Swedish Gladiators were fitted with the Fairey three-bladed propeller, the decision was taken to switch back to the earlier fixed-pitch two-bladed wooden propeller. The new J8s would serve in a new Fighter Wing that was intended to provide an aerial defence to the Stockholm region and would consist of three squadrons operating the J8. The new Fighter Wing was created alongside 4 Bomber Wing due to the rising of tensions in Europe. The J8s saw combat in Finland as part of military aid, while the rest were transferred to training units until their eventual retirement in 1947.
