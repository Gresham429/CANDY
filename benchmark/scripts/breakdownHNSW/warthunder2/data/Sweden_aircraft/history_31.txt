History of A21A-3: 
The SAAB 21 was a twin-boom propeller fighter used by the Swedish air force. A unique design, it had a pusher-configuration engine and a twin-boom tail, giving it a very unique appearance. The A21A-3 was a variant of the SAAB 21, designed for ground attack. As a result, it was equipped with a bomb sight, and was able to carry suspended ordnance and a RATO (Rocket-assisted takeoff) pod. 66 A21A-3 aircraft were built between 1947 and 1949, and served as the primary ground attacker until the introduction of more capable jet aircraft.[1]
