Usage of VL_Py%C3%B6rremyrsky: 
This 1945 aircraft is not a great fighter to low-level pursuits where really great top speed is crucial. But instead, use this plane for medium-altitude engagements. Where an altitude advantage allows the Py√∂rremyrsky to increase the speed and surprise its enemies with a proper turn rate. This aircraft excels in both boom 'n' zoom but is also an excellent dogfighter, sporting fantastic low speed handling characteristics (especially with combat and takeoff flaps), a steady gun platform and, as previously mentioned, a fairly tight turning circle.
