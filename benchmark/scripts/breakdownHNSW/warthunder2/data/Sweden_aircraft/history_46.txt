History of J32B: 
In the year 1948, SAAB started to develop a new type of multi purpose aircraft with capabilities such as a strike-fighter, interceptor or reconnaissance aircraft. The project was called P1150 and had the intent to replace the B18, J21A, A21R and the J30 aircraft. After some testing, a swept wing design typical for the time period was decided upon. After some testing with a Swedish jet engine design called the Dovern, it was decided that the engine lacked the desired power so a swap to the British Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.21 engine was decided upon due to its ability to produce more power without its afterburner on than the Dovern could even with the afterburner engaged. The airplane was designated the Saab 32 Lansen and flew for the first time in November 1952 with Bengt Olow as pilot.
