Description of Ju_88_A-4_(Sweden): 
The ▄Ju 88 A-4 was a multirole combat aircraft with a twin engine configuration, this specific variant was placed under Finnish service in 1943.  The A-4 variant was a very much needed improvement, longer wingspan, redesigned wingtips, stronger defensive armament, a more powerful engine, external bomb racks and reinforced undercarriage. Finland bought 24 Ju 88s during April 1943 and they were assigned to the No.44 squadron that was already experienced in twin engine bombers. The aircraft wasn't liked by the crews however, due to its complexity, crews stayed on the ground during most of 1943 in training, doing just a handful of raids and bombing missions into enemy territory.
