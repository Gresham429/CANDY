History of Saab_J35XS: 
Finland obtained the Swedish SAAB J35 Draken in 1970, as part of a collaboration between the two countries so that Sweden could provide the Finnish Air Force with J35 aircrafts of different variants. At the beginning Finland only received second hand models like the J35F, J35B and SK35C. However the J35XS variant was made by Finnish request and built as a kit assembled by Valmet in Finland. Valmet was also allowed to produce the spare parts for this aircrafts. The XS stands for Export Suomi (Export Finland).
