Usage of A29B: 
The A29B is armed with 4 x 20 mm Akan m/47C cannons, but still lack a bit of a punch for a fighter. The A29B has a good top speed but its acceleration is not the quickest. Once it has built up speed it can catch most enemy jets that it will face, but having an altitude advantage to dive on the target will help get that extra acceleration to hunt down targets.
