History of J26: 
The J26 is the Swedish version of the famous American P-51 Mustang. The Swedish air force had amassed several P-51s that were forced to ditch in the neutral country and procured 161 P-51D aircraft once the arms embargo was lifted. These aircraft served in several roles, including the mapping of new Soviet weapons installations. The last J26 Mustangs were retired in 1953, and almost all remaining airframes were sold to foreign countries including Israel, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.[1][2]
