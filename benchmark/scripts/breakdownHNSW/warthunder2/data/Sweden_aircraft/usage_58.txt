Usage of JAS39A: 
Gripens needs to be played in one way which is very different from all the other top-tier jets. The JAS39A has an underwhelming radar-guided missile out of all its opponents, meaning it will not play ever in BVR engagements, since it will always end up loosing. Instead, the Gripen shines in the furballs, where the chaos prevents anyone from being totally aware of its surroundings. There, it can use its two best assets: the RB 74(M) (a Swedish Version of the AIM-9M ) and the nearly-unlimited flares loadout the plane can carry. When approaching the danger zone, activate the automatic countermeasure release, set to cycle 1 sec with 0.5 sec between each release and 2 releases per cycle. You have about 4:30 minutes of pure adrenaline before you run out of flares (using flares and chaff should half the time, but sticking to the deck makes radar-guided missiles easily dodgeable). Now the player can pay less (not none) attention to their surroundings and focus on launching the RB 74(M) missiles. Do not focus too much on one target, lock on with radar so the missile won't go for the flares during the lock-on phase and prefer targets that are showing you their side: this way even if they flare the missile will be less likely to notice the flares at all.
The Gripen is also a good dogfighter, use the air brake until you get into the 700-850 km/h, that way you will pull like a monster.
