Usage of B18A: 
The B18A is a really good aircraft in all game modes. Its frontal armament is really powerful, using HEF shells. It does have a low ammo count of 300 for all guns, including the turrets. The B18A is a good bomber hunter, as you'll be facing He 111s which have such poor defensive armaments. You can easily destroy axis bombers with this plane. The G4M1 and He 111 don't hold a candle to this bomber. You can use this plane in all roles, even fighter.
