History of A28B: 
The Swedish air force carefully studied what was happening at the Fronts in WWII, and by 1944 it was already obvious that the propeller era was coming to a close. By early 1945, the Swedes had already begun a project to power the Saab J21 with a ramjet. However, it seemed this project would take far too long. By autumn of 1945, the J29 project was also beginning to take shape. But even this project wouldn't take to the skies until 1949, so a foreign design had to do until then.
