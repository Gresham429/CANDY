Description of B18A: 
Sweden had been using the Ju 86K (designated as the B3C) bomber as their main bomber. In 1938, a requirement was put forth to Swedish aircraft manufacturers for a fast reconnaissance aircraft with a crew of three. SAAB was awarded the contract for the project and began to build the SAAB 18. The B18 was modified from being just a reconnaissance aircraft to also being a medium bomber. It was deemed underpowered with the two R-1830 Twin Wasp radial engines, but these would later be replaced by license-built DB 605 liquid-cooled engines. Later, the B18B variant was modified to operate as a dive bomber/ground attack variant which could be outfitted with three 120 kg bombs or 12 m/51 rockets. The mid-project changes caused a significant delay in the production of the aircraft which didn't roll out for duty until mid-1944.
