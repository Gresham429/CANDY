History of B3C: 
The SAAB B3C began its life in the mid-1930s in Germany as the Junkers Ju 86. The purpose of this aircraft was to operate first as a high-speed passenger airliner but also function as a medium bomber with minimal conversion. Conversion from airliner required the removal of ten passenger seats and replaced with four bomb cells which carried each bomb in an upright position. Fuel tanks for the bomber version were located in the fuselage while the airliner moved them to the wings. Originally this bomber was outfitted with Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, their drawback was their weight, however, they were more fuel-efficient than standard petrol engines. Unfortunately during the Spanish Civil War, it was determined that the Ju 86 under-performed compared to the He 111, mainly because the diesel engines could not handle the rough treatment endured during combat situations. With this knowledge, the Ju 86 was converted to the BMW 132 radial engines which drastically improved the reliability of this bomber.
