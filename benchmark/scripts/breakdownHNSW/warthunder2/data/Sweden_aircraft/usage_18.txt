Usage of M%C3%B6rk%C3%B6-Morane: 
The Mörkö-Morane is an excellent fighter in Air Realistic battles, where its flight characteristics and weaponry make it very capable against both biplanes and monoplane fighters. Firstly, the Mörkö-Morane possesses a very good rate of climb. It is able to outclimb every biplane and practically every monoplane plane that it might face; the only exceptions are bombers that receive an air-spawn (such as the Ju 87) and early Bf 109s. Against every other plane, the Mörkö-Morane can have a great altitude advantage and choose exactly when it wants to engage. On that topic, deciding when to attack is a vital skill when flying this plane. Often, attacking bombers isn't worth it, since they can easily do more damage to you than you can do to them. As for fighters, it will very often be the case that if you leave the area for a minute or so, enemy fighters at or above your altitude will dive on your allies lower down. Then, you will have the altitude advantage and a more favourable position.
