Description of J11: 
Sweden bought a large number of CR.42 Falco biplanes between 1939 and 1941 as an emergency measure during the outbreak of WWII. A total of 72 fighters were delivered to Sweden with additional equipment such as radio sets, and these fighters were designated J11. During its lifetime, the CR.42 Falco gained a troubled reputation since it suffered many accidents, often due to the poor quality of materials used by Fiat. As with most biplanes, pilots appreciated its excellent dogfighting abilities, but complained about the poor top speed, insufficient armament, and open cockpits that were not suited for the cold weather of Sweden. The aircraft was decommissioned in 1945 for good, and some were sold to civilian contractors while others were used as target practice.
