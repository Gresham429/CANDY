Usage of JA37D: 
The JA37D is a highly manoeuvrable aircraft and outperforms most jets in its class, especially at lower altitudes (< 3,000 m). At higher altitudes, the Viggen remains manoeuvrable but, due to its delta-canard configuration, it is prone to losing speed and energy rather fast. This however does not pose much of an issue thanks to the aircraft's effective engine and high rate of acceleration at speeds above 700 km/h and aerodynamics.
