Usage of Ar_196_A-5_(Sweden): 
The Arado functions well as a support fighter, having good firepower out the back and front. A competent 196 pilot can turn the tide of a dogfight, as its turning ability and powerful weaponry make short work of early war fighters, this is one of the rare planes to mount 20 mm at this BR. The MG 81Z in the observer's position (twin MG 81s) is also a very real threat to enemy aircraft, sporting a very high fire rate with armour piercing and incendiary ammunition. The 196, however, does not have a huge amount of staying power in a fight, as its 20 mm cannons have a fairly average ammunition pool - and once it's depleted the pilot is left with only a single 7.92 mm MG 17. Its flaps, however, are very effective - meaning they drastically reduce the turning radius and have very high rip speeds, which can be used to its advantage during an engagement.
