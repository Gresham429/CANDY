Description of J21A-2: 
The J21A-2 was the second production series and an improved version of the J21A-1 (though performance was improved, the J21 was still an obsolete aircraft at its time). The only differences between the A-1 and A-2 were a separated centre wing flap for the fuselage, and new cooling fins around the engine for the liquid and oil coolers.
