Usage of J11: 
The J11 plays identical to the Italian counterpart, capable of high speeds without sacrificing the agility a biplane offers. The engine is almost twice as powerful compared to the J6B found before it, and the strong framework allows for even higher speeds, allowing the J11 to chase down opponents in battle. Most importantly, however, is that the J11 offers greater climb and energy retention, allowing for a bit more boom & zoom compared to other biplanes. The J11 turns a bit worse than other biplanes, which is logical considering the powerful engine and heavy steel structure it features. This makes extended dogfights against other biplanes difficult, but should be avoidable by most J11 players if speed is kept at an all-time high.
