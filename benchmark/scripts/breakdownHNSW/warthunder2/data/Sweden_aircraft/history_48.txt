History of J34: 
In the 1950s and after developing the J29 Tunnan, the Swedish Air Force needed a high speed interceptor capable of intercepting enemy bombers at high altitudes, mostly Soviet Designs, that at the time, could still be intercepted by subsonic aircraft. While the J29 formed the backbone of the Swedish Air Force, the Hawker Hunter was employed in the interception role, but it was also used in patrols and if needed, in air-to-air combat.
