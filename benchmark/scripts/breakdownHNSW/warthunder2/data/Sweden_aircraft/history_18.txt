History of M%C3%B6rk%C3%B6-Morane: 
The Soviet invasion of Finland in late 1939 marked the beginning of the Winter War. The Finnish Air Force was under-equipped, only having Bristol Blenheim bombers, Fokker D.XXI monoplanes, and Bristol Bulldog biplanes. New aircraft were needed to better resist the Soviet Air Force, which was much larger in number though largely equipped with older Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters. Finnish units ended up performing excellently with these older aircraft owing to their better tactics, but the Finnish government continued to obtain whatever fighters were available from a wide variety of sources.
