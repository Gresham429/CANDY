Description of MiG-27K: 
Following the introduction of the MiG-27 into the Soviet Air Force in the mid 1970s, a major upgrade program was initiated by Mikoyan OKB to overhaul the MiG-27's capabilities. This program included the addition of the powerful Kayra-23 laser-optical sight and targeting system, permitting the aircraft to use laser and TV-guided ordnance, along with many upgrades to the avionics and airframe. In the end, this heavily upgraded variant entered service as the MiG-27K, with a large order for the Soviet Air Force. However, due to lack of funding and the high costs, the Soviet Air Force would cut their MiG-27K order in half, and instead order the other half to be a cheaper variant. Mikoyan OKB would then develop the MiG-27M as the "cheaper" upgraded variant.
