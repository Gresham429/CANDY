Usage of I-153P: 
Unlike other I-153s that are armed with 7.62 mm machine guns, the I-153P with its 20 mm calibre has comparatively few shells in the gun's magazine, so while the 20 mm can be used to easily destroy enemies, it will require good shot accuracy to make the most of the limited ammunition.
