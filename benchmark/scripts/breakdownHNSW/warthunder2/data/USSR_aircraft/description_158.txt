Description of Su-7BMK: 
The Su-7BMK was devised almost immediately after the Su-7BM variant, as a downgraded export version for overseas customers outside the Warsaw Pact, being sold to many overseas customers including Egypt, India, North Korea, Algeria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The primary users of the BMK were India and Egypt, both of which successfully used the aircraft in active combat. The BM (and its export variant, the BMK) provide multiple upgrades over the older Su-7B variant. Primarily, the aircraft were fitted with the more reliable and powerful Saturn AL-7F-1 engine and "wet pylons" under the wings, allowing the aircraft to use external fuel tanks.
