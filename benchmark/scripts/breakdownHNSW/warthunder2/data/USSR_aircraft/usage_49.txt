Usage of IL-2_(1941): 
For tactics, IL-2s are built to be close to the ground. Fly very low for IL-2 pilots in reality were known to skim treetops. Further try to stay out of sight of enemy planes. As tough as you are, you cannot take concentrated fire from enemy fighters, especially heavy fighters. As you near your target (about 3 km away) go into a slight climb, then nose down into a moderate dive toward your target. Imagine yourself gliding in, not diving. It is generally recommended that you use bombs first, as this will immediately lighten the plane and make you more manoeuvrable. Because the IL-2 flies so close to the ground, some pilots have destroyed themselves by bombing targets right under them. To avoid this, set the bomb fuses to around 2 seconds.
