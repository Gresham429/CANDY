Description of Tu-14T: 
The Tu-14T was developed as a competitor to the IL-28 bomber. The project resulted in the Tu-14T being used as a torpedo bomber with a similar design nature to that of the IL-28. However the Tu-14 proved inferior to the IL-28. It was capable of carrying more weight compared to its competitor but it was slower and less reliable. The Tu-14T was used as a maritime reconnaissance and torpedo bomber, the T in the name was added to signify its role of torpedo bomber. The low priority of maritime aircraft meant it was produced in low numbers, with 88 units built in the early '50s and it served as the Soviet Union's main torpedo bomber between 1961 and 1970.
