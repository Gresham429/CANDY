Usage of LaGG-3-11: 
The LaGG-3-11 is best use as a multirole fighter with a good climb rate, making boom and zoom a viable tactic, but turn fighting can help when facing less nimble aircraft. The armaments are nose mounted and fewer in number than most counterparts, making this plane less beginner friendly. Accuracy and trigger discipline are more important as there won't be much rounds when pulling the trigger, but when the rounds hit, it deals effective damage.
