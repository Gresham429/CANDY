Description of I-225: 
The I-225 was a proposed Soviet high altitude interceptor. It marked the conclusion of the I-220 series which was originally derived from the MiG-3. Compared to its predecessors, the I-225 was both the heaviest and the most powerful. Additionally, it had a significantly improved Shchyerbakov pressure cabin, a 64mm armour-glass windscreen, 8mm seat armour, and an arsenal of four synchronized 20mm ShVAK cannons. The I-225 was designed to have a top speed of more than 700 km/h and a service ceiling of 12,000 meters, which made it capable of intercepting enemy aircraft at high altitudes. The second prototype, which is the one we have in the game, became the second fastest Soviet piston-engined fighter, only being surpassed by the Yak-3M. Despite its promising performance, the I-225 faced too many delays as most of the work was focused on the I-250, and in the end, it ended up being overshadowed by other aircraft designs.
