Usage of La-5F: 
Before engaging in aerial combat, it is essential to have a strategic plan to maximize your chances of success. One of the first steps in this process is to gain altitude and get an overview of the battlefield. Climbing to a height of 3,000-3,500 meters provides a good vantage point to spot any potential threats and allows you to identify any enemy planes that might be flying at the same altitude or higher. These planes are potential hazards and must be dealt with immediately.
