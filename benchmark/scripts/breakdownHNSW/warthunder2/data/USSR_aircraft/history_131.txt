History of Yak-23: 
During early 1947, the Soviet Union wanted a single-seat jet aircraft equipped with an engine produced by Rolls-Royce. The job was given to Soviet aircraft manufacturer Yakovlev and in July 1947, the aircraft was unveiled and flown for the first time. Just as the Yak-15 and the Yak-17, the main fuselage was based on that of the Yak-3, and the Yak-jets along with the SAAB J21R were the only aircraft to be successfully converted to jet fighters from piston-powered props.
