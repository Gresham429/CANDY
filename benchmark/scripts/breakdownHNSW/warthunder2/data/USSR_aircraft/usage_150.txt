Usage of MiG-19PT: 
Since the MiG-19PT has great vertical energy retention and acceleration, you should use this to your advantage. Taking the enemies vertical is the best move as they will quickly lose energy while you can maintain it. The airbrake is also a very effective tool, allowing you to stay behind someone if they try to force you to overshoot and the plane also rolls well enough that you can engage in rolling scissors if need be.
