Description of MiG-15: 
Shortly after the first generation Soviet jet fighters were entering service, the plans for far more improved "second generation" fighters were already underway. Mikoyan OKB would begin testing swept wing designs on their MiG-8 prototype before a major breakthrough in aviation technology occurred in the Soviet Union: the United Kingdom not only authorized the sale of their latest and highly advanced Rolls-Royce Nene and Derwent engines, but also sold a license for production to the Soviets to produce them as the RD-45 and RD-500 respectively. As such, all new second generation fighter projects quickly restarted and drew up new designs to use these new engines. Mikoyan was no exception, with their I-310 prototype utilizing a 35 degree swept wing on a high-tailplane airframe powered by a single RD-45 engine. In the end, this design and Lavochkin's Project 174 ended up beating Yakovlev's heavily delayed Yak-30, and were chosen as the Soviet Union's second-generation jet fighters, entering production as the MiG-15 and La-15 respectively. The MiG-15 would go on to serve a very long and fruitful life with many countries all around the world and would be produced in other regions of the world (both with and without a license) as the Lim-1 in Poland, the S-102 in Czechoslovakia, and the J-2 in China.
