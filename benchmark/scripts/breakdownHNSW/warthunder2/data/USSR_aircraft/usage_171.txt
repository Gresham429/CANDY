Usage of Su-22M3: 
In air battles, like the Su-17, the Su-22M3's usage and capabilities are heavily dependent on how well you can use the variable sweep to your advantage. With the wings fully swept, its performance at low speeds can become extremely sluggish, making you an easy target for any fighter that finds you at slow speeds. However, with the wings unswept and with awareness of your speed, altitude, and enemy presence, you can dominate any sustained fights. It is best to start out your match by attacking bombing bases, then after all your bombs are dropped, head into direction of the enemy teams base at low altitudes and avoid head-ons. Try to drag fighters away from the group.
