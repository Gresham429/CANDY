Usage of MiG-21PFM: 
The MiG-21PFM was designed to be a fighter-interceptor, similar to the earlier F-13, and thus all of its design features shape it into virtually a missile with a cockpit. Thus, it is quite effective in air battles in the interceptor role. However, note that this MiG-21 gets access to the Kh-66 guided air-to-ground missiles making it a viable option for ground battles as well.
