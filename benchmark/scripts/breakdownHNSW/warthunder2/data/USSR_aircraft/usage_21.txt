Usage of Yak-4: 
The Yak-4 can be used primarily as a ground attack aircraft, as its small bomb load prevents it from being an effective bomber. Pilots can utilize the aircraft's airspawn and 100 kg bomb load to destroy softer targets, then return to base to rearm. The aircraft is fitted with a single frontal 7.62 mm ShKAS machine gun and a similar weapon at the rear of the cockpit; though effective, these machine guns are no match for the armament typically carried on fighters the Yak-4 will face in battle. Thus, avoid getting into any dogfights, and if being chased, use the dorsal turret to light up any pursuing aircraft.
