Usage of MiG-3-15_(BK): 
Even in Arcade, the Mig-3-15 is relatively inferior to most competitors. Its battle rating puts it with fighters such as the A6M2-N, F4F, and even the early Yak line. However, high altitude performance is one redeeming aspect, as is its top speed as well as level speed. Use this to your advantage, and BnR is very effective and BnZ is do-able as well.
