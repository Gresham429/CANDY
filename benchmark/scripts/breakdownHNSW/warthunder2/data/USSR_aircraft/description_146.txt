Description of La-174: 
Shortly after the end of WWII in Europe, following the advancements from first generation jet-fighter projects such as the Sukhoi Aircraft K prototype and the Yak-15 family, the Soviet Union laid down a new set of requirements for a second generation jet fighter project. The main candidates were Mikoyan's I-310 prototype, Yakovlev's Yak-30 prototype, and Lavochkin's Project 52. Project 52 differed from the competitors, as the project was for not one, but two aircraft. These two aircraft were designated La-174 and La-174D, the only difference being that the normal 174 used the reverse engineered Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, while the latter 174D used the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. In the end, only the Derwent powered prototype (reverse engineered as the Klimov RD-500 engine) was chosen to enter production as the La-15. However, due to the exponential advancements in technology in the early '50s, the La-15's service would be short lived, as more advanced aircraft with supersonic capability entered service and quickly replaced it, such as the new MiG-19 and MiG-21.
