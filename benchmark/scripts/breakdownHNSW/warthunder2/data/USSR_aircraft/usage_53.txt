Usage of DB-3B: 
In Simulator, the DB-3 has distinct pros and cons. It is a brilliant base / airfield-bombing plane with a maximum bombload of 1x 1,000 kg + 2x 500 kg bombs, allowing it to easily finish a base or cripple airfield modules in one run. The bombs drop one by one, allowing flexible targeting. (Note that the 1,000 kg bomb drops slightly in-front of the 500 kg bombs.) It is also one of the few USSR planes with torpedoes. It has greatly improved handling and stability comparing with the previous SB 2M, making flying a lot easier. However the DB-3 is quite slow, making it an easy target to pick on. It also has next to no defensive firepower: only 3 x 7.62 mm MGs in total; the one in the nose has great coverage, however most opponents are not likely to take head-ons. The top turret cannot even aim horizontally nor directly at the tail, meaning that the seemingly suicidal tactic of tailing a bomber can actually destroy a DB-3. The belly gun has good negative angle but its horizontal guidance is too limited. Therefore you can only target opponents at your front, upper half and lower rear.
