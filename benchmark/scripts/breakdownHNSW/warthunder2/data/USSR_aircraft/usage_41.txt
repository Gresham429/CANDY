Usage of MiG-3-34: 
The MiG-3-34 is an interceptor which are mainly used to intercept bombers and strike aircraft, and take them out quickly with its 2 x 20 mm ShVAK cannons which can deal large amounts of damage in close range. Be mindful of bombers with large fuselages which are designed to take large amounts of damage; these can drain your ammo quickly. All interceptors get an air spawn behind the base, use this to your advantage and find a good climb ratio that lets you gain both altitude and speed, and keep in mind that MiG series interceptors work best at high altitudes.
