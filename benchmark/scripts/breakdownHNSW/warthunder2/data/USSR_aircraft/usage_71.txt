Usage of Yak-9K: 
Most enemy fighters will be between 3,000 and 3,800 m, with bombers being around 4,000 to 5,000 m. It's important to use your height advantage, drop down from your height and and get behind the enemy. Once behind the fighter or bomber, do not engage until you are close enough to see their tails in your crosshair. Aim forward and fire only a single shot or a short burst which is no longer than two seconds. If you miss and they turn, pending how sharp the turn is follow them. If it's a very sharp turn do not turn with them, instead open the throttle and climb back up to gain a height advantage. Then either try it again or find a new bandit to knock out.
