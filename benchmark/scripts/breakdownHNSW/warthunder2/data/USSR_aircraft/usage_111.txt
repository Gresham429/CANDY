Usage of Yer-2_(ACh-30B)_(e): 
The Yer-2 with diesel ACh-30B engines is the last traditional heavy bomber in the Soviet tree until the Tu-4, and it retains its previous models' strengths and weaknesses. The main draw of the diesel Yer-2s is the gigantic payload at its disposal (up to 5,000 kg), being the second best at the BR behind the British Lancaster. However, the heavier diesel engines mean that it is actually slower than the earlier M-105-engined variants.
