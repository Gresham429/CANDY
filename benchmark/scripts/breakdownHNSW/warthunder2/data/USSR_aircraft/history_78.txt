History of IL-2M_(1943): 
The IL-2M (1943) was one of many variants designed and produced by Iluyshin. The 1943 production series of aircraft was intended to have the upgraded AM-38F engine armed with the 23 mm VYa-23 cannons. During 1943, 20 mm-armed IL-2s were slowly phased out and soon 23 mm-armed IL-2s were dominant. The IL-2M (1943) was largely unchanged from early variants other than the engine, cannons, and the crucial addition of a rear gunner. VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily; Soviet Air Force) units began receiving the IL-2M (1943) in early 1943.
