Description of MiG-17AS: 
During 1964, Cuba became one of the first export customers outside the Warsaw Pact of the MiG-17 aircraft, having purchased the MiG-17AS variant to replace its aging MiG-15bis fleet in the frontline fighter role. The MiG-17AS, in addition to the more reliable engine, had the required wiring to mount and use the R-3S air-to-air missile. The aircraft would serve a long life with the Cuban Air Force before being phased out of service in favour of MiG-23s during the 80s. The MiG-17AS in Cuban service is most famous for the Homestead incident; on October 5, 1969, Cuban MiG-17AS #232 was flown by Lieutenant Eduardo Guerra Jimenez to defect to the United States, landing it in Homestead AFB, Florida, and sparking major controversy and reforms about American security almost instantly, as President Lyndon B. Johnson's Boeing 707 "Air Force One" was at the time also at the airbase used for the defection, and as the Cuban pilot's intentions were not known until after he landed (undetected), had his intentions been different, he could have easily not only destroyed Air Force One on the ground, but started a surprise attack on US soil.
