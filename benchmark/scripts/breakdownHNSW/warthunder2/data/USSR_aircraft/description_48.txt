Description of La-5F: 
The La-5F was a significant upgrade from its predecessor, the La-5. It was equipped with an improved M-82F engine that allowed for constant operation in overdrive mode, enhancing the aircraft's power output.  The La-5F underwent various upgrades, including a reduced overall weight, new radio equipment, cockpit ventilation, lowered fuselage spine fairing, convex cockpit, and bullet-proof glass. The La-5F demonstrated superiority over the La-5, especially at low altitudes, with improved speed, climbing rate, and pilot operating conditions. Production of the La-5F continued until the end of 1943, with 4,150 units built.
