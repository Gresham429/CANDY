Usage of MiG-29: 
The MiG-29 has a unique flight character, its engines consume a lot of fuel thus the external fuel tank, getting rid of the external fuel tank will reduce drag and improve the performance of the aircraft, this is mostly done before engaging a target. But the engines also provide excellent thrust at a very wide range of speeds giving you enough power to engage in long-lasting dogfights. The aircraft is not equipped with variable wing sweep, which is not very noticeable. Only when flying at high speeds at lower altitudes will you begin to notice that the wings produce much lift. The MiG-29 has decent manoeuvrability at high and low speeds, the energy retention is not something to complain about either. The 30 mm guns have a high velocity, making it easy to aim at targets, and are much better than earlier Soviet aircraft. The missiles which are the most effective are the R-60M and R-27ER. The R-60M are very easy to flare off, and at its BR many people will dodge these missiles in a head-on fairly easily. But the R-27ER has some very effective performance, with an improved radar system this missile will rock the battlefield.
