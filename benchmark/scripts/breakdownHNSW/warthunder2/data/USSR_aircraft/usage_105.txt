Usage of I-225: 
The I-225 can be used to climb to bomber altitude (4-6 km) and act as an interceptor, and it can perform this role amicably with its good climb rate, high speed and fast-firing quad ShVAK 20 mm cannons that can start fires. Be wary that the I-225 has no bulletproof glass in the front to protect this pilot, so you should never tail any bomber and approach from oblique angles or force head-ons. Also its armament of four 20 mm can be lacking against large aircraft, so I-225 players will likely have to expend all of their ammo in a bomber if they want to bring it down.
