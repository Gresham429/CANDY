Usage of Pe-2-1: 
The Pe-2-1 Peshka's firepower is rather meagre, only really meant to scare off the enemies with the right angle. The 7.62 mm calibre weapons won't be destroying enemy aircraft with a quick burst. The defensive turrets are also armed with the same 7.62 mm weapons which are also poor in both firepower and protection. The turret firing arcs are small (Dorsal: 80째 horizontal, +5 - +60째 vertical; Ventral: 80째 horizontal, -10 - -20째 vertical) and open hatches mean that there are blind spots and the gunners could be quickly dispatched by a strafing aircraft. As such, it's not wise to spawn in the Pe-2 if you don't have friendly fighters up.
