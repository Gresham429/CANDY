History of Fw_190_D-9_(USSR): 
Kurt Tank, the designer of the venerable Fw 190 lineup quickly realized by 1943 that the field of aerial warfare was changing rapidly. The world had moved on beyond dive bombers, and the allies had begun forming massive, four-engine bomber wings that devastated Axis ground troops and factories. At the time, Fw 190s played similar roles to the American P-47 Thunderbolts, serving as ground attack planes and low altitude interceptors. Fw 190s retained air superiority over allied forces all the way up to the introduction of the British Spitfire Mk. IX. Despite this impressive service record, Fw 190s had one flaw, which would soon usher in the need of the "Dora" Line-up. Their performance was hindered drastically at higher altitudes, where aerial warfare was now moving towards. Germany, in desperate need of fighters to engage and stop these massive bomber raids had turned to Messerschmitt and Focke-wulf to produce a high altitude interceptor, and Kurt Tank's response was the Fw 190 D-9.
