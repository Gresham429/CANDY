Description of Su-9: 
Towards the end of the Second World War, the USSR quickly began pursuing multiple jet-powered fighter projects to catch up to the western Gloster Meteor, Me-262, and F-80. One such project was "Aircraft K" from the Sukhoi design bureau, which was heavily influenced by captured German designs (namely the Me 262). The aircraft was originally conceived to use the new and upcoming indigenous Soviet jet engines being designed by Lyulka and Tumansky, however, due to setbacks on those programs, the aircraft plan was changed to instead use reverse engineered copies of the German Jumo-004 engine. The aircraft would bear the shape of the Me 262, but in reality, was almost completely different, having different weight distributions, wing design, tailplane shapes, and more importantly, a completely revised flap and airbrake system. This aircraft, now called the "Sukhoi Su-9", would finally fly in 1946 for the first time, where it was quickly revealed that the German engines were rather underpowered. The Lyulka TR-1 engines originally intended for the plane would finally be completed, however, it was revealed that mounting them required extensive redesign of the aircraft, which directly resulted in the Su-11 prototype.
