Usage of Su-39: 
The Su-39's formidable arsenal of precision-guided weapon systems is explicitly tailored to unleash devastating target destruction capabilities across a diverse spectrum of ground attack scenarios. Take, for instance, the Kh-29 missile, a long-range precision instrument capable of obliterating entrenched enemies or flagships with surgical accuracy at an impressive range of 13 kilometres. Its potency is further magnified in engaging time-sensitive targets such as escort warships or mobile air defense systems, where the Kh-25 missile's rapid response capabilities ensure swift and effective destruction. In addition, the use of Mercury and Kopyo pods enhance the power projection capabilities and combat abilities of the aircraft. One of the primary capabilities of the Kopyo-25 radar pod is its ability to provide radar imaging and multi-target tracking via TWS mode. This allows the Su-39 to detect and track ground and air targets, even in adverse weather conditions or challenging terrain. The radar pod's imaging and tracking capabilities enable the aircraft to effectively identify and engage both stationary and moving targets, which are slaved to the FLIR, enhancing the pilot's situational awareness. The Kopyo-25 radar pod also plays a crucial role in target designation and guidance for precision-guided munitions. By accurately locating and designating targets, the radar pod enables the Su-39 to deliver highly accurate and effective strikes against a variety of targets effortlessly, including armoured vehicles, fortifications, and other high-value objectives. This enhances the aircraft's versatility and effectiveness in both offensive and defensive roles.
