Usage of MiG-17: 
The MiG-17 should be played like its predecessors, the MiG-15s. In 1v1 situations, the -17 will easily win if played correctly, and due to its superior flight characteristics it is easier to win fights against multiple enemies. You have the upper hand in the initial dogfight, as your great turn will allow you to get on their 6 without much difficulty. However, in a prolonged engagement the chances of you losing increase due to your heavier weight and good, yet not spectacular energy retention. If the player is uncomfortable with dogfighting, the MiG-17 can also be a very effective boom-and-zoom fighter.
