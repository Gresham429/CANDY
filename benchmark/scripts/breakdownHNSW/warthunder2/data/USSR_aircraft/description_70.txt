Description of Yak-9T: 
The Yakovlev Yak-9T was the second variant of the Yak-9 fighter aircraft family. Instead of the usual 20 mm ShVAK cannon, it was armed with a 37 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 cannon with 30 rounds. To compensate for the heavier nose, the cockpit was shifted backwards by 0.4 m. Poor quality control resulted in many oil and coolant leaks from the cannon recoil during test firing, which were solved during the prototype testing stage. Recoil and limited ammunition availability necessitated precise aiming with two- or three-round bursts. The Yak-9T was widely used against enemy ships on the Black Sea and tanks on various fronts (the cannon could penetrate up to 40 mm armour from 500 m), but it was also effective against enemy aircraft (a single cannon hit was usually enough to tear apart the aircraft airframe). Yak-9T had a significant morale impact on the opponent. It was extremely popular among flight crews, owing to its formidable weaponry and excellent flight performance. The aircraft was mass-manufactured from March 1943 to June 1945, and a total of 2,748 aircraft were produced. Flight experiments were carried out on the Central Front in August 1943 by the 16VA ("Vozdushnaya Armia" - Air Army).
