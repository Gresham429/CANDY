Usage of LaGG-3-34: 
The LaGG-3-34 is very powerful against attacker/bomber aircraft, and though the NS-37 isn't the most accurate, they are large targets you can usually take them out with relative ease. As such it is best to stay at high altitudes in order to dive on enemy bombers. The NS-37 is the same cannon as in the Yak-9T, so players experienced with that aircraft will feel right at home in this aircraft. The LaGG-3-34 can also provide ground support when equipped with AP rounds, although the slight inaccuracy with the cannon can make it difficult at long ranges against tanks.
