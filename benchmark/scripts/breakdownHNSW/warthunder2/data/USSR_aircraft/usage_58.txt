Usage of LaGG-3-4: 
As a fighter, the LaGG-3-4 packs quite a punch at its low tier. The powerful cannon in the nose of the plane allows it to potentially dish out large amounts of damage to unsuspecting aircraft, biplanes, monoplanes and bombers alike. Its heavy armament makes it the perfect aircraft to pounce on carefully selected enemies that are on their own or engaged in a furball at low altitudes. Due to the average rate of climb, this aircraft is best used in diving attacks, booming and zooming in and out of the fray.
