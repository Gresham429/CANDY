Usage of La-11: 
Upon quick inspection of the La-11, players can find some noticeable differences from the original La-9: one less cannon and the removal of the cooling system under the fuselage. The plane itself performs like a less powerful version of the La-9 with longer range, so players of La-9 will quickly feel like home.
