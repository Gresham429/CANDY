History of ITP_(M-1): 
The Polikarpov ITP (Istrebitel' Tyazhely Pushechny - heavy cannon fighter) was a prototype Soviet fighter aircraft that never reached production. Designed to mount a heavy armament of 20 and 37 mm cannons, the ITP was significantly hampered by the unreliability of its powerplants, resulting in its eventual cancellation in 1944.
