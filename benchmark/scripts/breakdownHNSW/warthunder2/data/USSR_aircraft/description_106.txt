Description of La-7B-20: 
The La-7B-20 was originally intended to equip a set of 3 x B-20S 20mm cannons. However due to reliability problems with said armament, 2 x 20mm ShVAK cannons were used instead, the same armament as the previous La-5 series of fighters. A total of 368 fighters of this type were produced before switching to the regular La-7. The 3 x B-20 cannons were known as "three pointers" and were liked by test pilots.
