Description of Be-6: 
The Be-6 was a Soviet multi-purpose flying boat designed with the intent of carrying out various maritime missions. The primary purposes for which it was designed were anti-submarine warfare, transport operations, and reconnaissance missions. It was developed in the late 1940s by Beriev OKB and first flew in 1949.  The Be-6 was equipped with powerful ASH-73 engines and a large fuel capacity, allowing it to fly for an extended period of time and possibly cover more than 4,000 kilometres without refuelling. It was remarkably well protected for its time, with five powerful NR-23 cannons mounted in the nose and tail turrets, providing effective defense against possible aerial threats. The aircraft served for quite a long time, considering the rapid technological advancement during that era, and wasn't retired until the late 1960s.
