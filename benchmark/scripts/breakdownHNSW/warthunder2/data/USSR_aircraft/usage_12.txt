Usage of BB-1: 
The BB-1 is one of the best low-BR ground attackers available, and is potent in every game mode. In Air Battles, it's advisable to take the 12 x 50 kg loadout, as it will allow you to do a bit of base-bombing. In Mixed battles, the most potent loadout is the 2 x 250 kg option, which will destroy or critically damage most tanks around this BR, even if you don't get a precise hit. It is recommended to set a 1.5s fuse for low-altitude attacks. After you are out of bombs, you can engage other fighters/attackers or strafe out AAA, light tanks and open topped vehicles (these are plentiful in low tier ground battles). It is not advised to dogfight but it does well in a head-on (because of the rate of fire, not the armour).
