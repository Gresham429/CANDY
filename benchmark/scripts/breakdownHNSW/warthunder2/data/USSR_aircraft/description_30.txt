Description of Hampden_TB_Mk_I_(USSR): 
The â–‚Hampden TB Mk I UTK-1 was a British medium bomber serving also as a torpedo bomber. On 4th September 1942, 32 Hampden TB Mk I torpedo bombers from 144th Squadron RAF and 455th Squadron RAAF took off from their bases in the Shetlands to take part in Operation Orator, protecting the Murmansk-bound convoy PQ 18. The Hampdens flew over 3,900 km over sea and enemy territory until they arrived in Vayenga. Eight Hampdens were lost en route or damaged beyond repair. The British and Australian crews conducted a few sorties from Vayenga and were supposed to return with their Hampdens to Shetlands; however, strong headwinds prevented this as the Hampdens would not be able to reach their bases. The British instead trained Soviet crews in using the Hampdens and returned home by ship. The Soviet Navy's 24th Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment then operated the Hampdens until mid-1943 when lack of replacements and suitable spare parts forced them to withdraw them from service and return back to their original IL-4/DB-3 series bombers.
