History of Yak-28B: 
The Yak-28 "Brewer" is a swept-wing turbojet bomber used by the Soviet Air Force in the 1960s. In the late 1950s, the Yakovlev design bureau began work on an improved version of the Yak-26, which underperformed and failed to enter production. The new aircraft was powered by two Tumansky R-11 afterburning turbojet engines producing 57 kn of thrust each, slung in underwing nacelles. Otherwise, the aircraft featured a conventional configuration, with a 45-degree swept wing and a mid-tail-mounted horizontal stabilizer. The aircraft was primarily subsonic at low altitude but capable of 1840 km/h at higher altitude.
