Usage of TB-3M-17-32: 
TB-3 is, in a nutshell, a typical heavy bomber, and a very heavy, very slow one at that. It packs a truly majestic payload of 3,000 kg of bombs, however, the problem is in getting this payload to its target. The maximum speed of TB-3 is less than 200 km/h and its flight will take a really long time during which the giant TB-3 will become a very easy and enticing target for all enemy fighters and even some bombers. All this combined with practically non-existent manoeuvrability makes this bomber a very vulnerable one and its pilots may consider themselves lucky if they reach the target - not mentioning the route back. However, the TB-3 is not at all defenceless. Five turrets with a total of eight 7.62 mm DA machine guns present quite an effective firepower - at least against fighters of the TB-3 age. When attacked, don't even bother with manoeuvres, man the turrets and open fire, it is the only hope of the TB. The effectiveness of the turret fire is multiplied thanks to one previously mentioned factor - very low speed. As the maximum speed of TB-3 is equal to a terminal speed of most of the fighters, these fighters will often have a hard time intercepting the TB, while the TB gunners will gain a great opportunity of hitting slowly approaching enemy planes. This tactics, however, doesn't work very well when attacked from below. In that case, pray.
