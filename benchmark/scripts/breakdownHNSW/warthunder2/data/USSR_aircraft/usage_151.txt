Usage of MiG-21F-13: 
The MiG-21F-13 was designed to be a fighter-interceptor and thus all of its design features shape it into virtually a missile with a cockpit. This aircraft wasn't designed to carry the load the F-4C, G.91 YS or the Super Mystere B2 could, but it was built for speed and to bring along the minimal amount of armament to do its job.
