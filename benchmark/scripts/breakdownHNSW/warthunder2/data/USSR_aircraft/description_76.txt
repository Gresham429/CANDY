Description of La-5FN: 
The La-5FN was a fighter produced at the same time as the La-5F, rather than being its successor, the main improvement was the introduction of a fuel-injected engine. This came in the form of the ASh-82FN engine that could produce 1,850 HP for up to 10 minutes. In combat tests against a Bf 109 G-2, the La-5FN showed superiority in speed and manoeuvrability at low and medium altitudes. These results influenced Soviet tactics. It used the same twin 20 mm ShVAK cannons as the La-5F, but with 200 rounds per gun.
