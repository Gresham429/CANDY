History of Hampden_TB_Mk_I_(USSR): 
The Handley Page Hampden was the last and fastest twin-engined bomber of the aircraft designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32. Which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally equipped with Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K gun in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defense. This was then switched to two Vickers K gun with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames because of the slim, compact, and cramped fuselage. It was often nicknamed the "Flying Suitcase". Oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber Do 17, which had the nickname the "Flying Pencil".
