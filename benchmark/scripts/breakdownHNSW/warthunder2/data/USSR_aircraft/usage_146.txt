Usage of La-174: 
Due to its incredible top speed for its battle rating, competing with the fastest at its battle rating, the La-174 should be employed in boom and zoom tactics. Gain altitude (and thus energy), and use this energy to execute hit-and-runs on opposing aircraft. Your powerful 23 mm NR-23 cannons will help you kill targets in minimal time. Despite the fact it is very manoeuvrable, it suffers from the issue of having incredibly weak wings, and they will likely snap if you attempt to turn fight other jets at high speed. However, if it needs to turn, it can hold its energy for an extended period and come out of a turn at a higher speed than most opponents.
