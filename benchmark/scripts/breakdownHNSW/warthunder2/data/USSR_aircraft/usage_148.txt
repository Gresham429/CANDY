Usage of Yak-38M: 
The Yak-38 is not very fast (you can reach Mach 1 in a slight dive when carrying minimum loadout) and not very nimble (bad energy retention in tight turns) so you'll lose many engagements with dedicated boom and zoom and dogfight optimised aircraft. What really makes this plane shine is the customizable loadout as well as its amazing rate of climb (101.2 m/s when spaded) and acceleration.
