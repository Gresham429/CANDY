Description of Su-6_(AM-42): 
The Su-6 was a project by Sukhoi with the objective of creating an attack aircraft capable of surpassing the Il-2. The Su-6 AM-42 was the name given to its last version. Compared to previous prototypes, it featured the same rear gunner as the third prototype, Su-6 (M-71F), but now with a liquid-cooled inline engine instead of a radial engine, the Mikulin AM-42. While this engine was less powerful than the M-71F, it proved to be more reliable. The Su-6 AM-42 was tested against the Il-10 in 1944, but the tests favoured the design from Ilyushin and the Su-6 never went into serial production.
