Usage of Pe-2-359: 
Its fixed armament consists of two nose-mounted machine guns – one 12.7 mm (0.5 in) UB machine gun with 150 rounds, and one 7.62 mm (0.3 in) ShKAS machine gun with 450 rounds. Another four machine guns are mounted as defensive armament. Two 12.7 mm UBT machine guns are mounted in dorsal and ventral turrets, and two ShKAS machine guns are mounted inside positions. The basic bomb load consists of six 100 kg (220 lb) carried internally in one central bomb bay and two smaller ordnance points at the rear of the engine nacelles. Through further progression, you can then unlock DZ-40 bomb racks, allowing you to carry three different ordnance configurations – either four 100 kg bombs internally and two 250 kg (551 lb) bombs externally, four 250 kg bombs externally, or two 500 kg (1102 lb) bombs externally. Alternatively, you can also unlock RO-132 rocket rails which will allow you to carry ten 132 mm (5.2") RS-132 rockets.
