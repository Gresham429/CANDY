Usage of Su-7BMK: 
The Su-7BMK can bomb bases, intercept bombers, and fight other fighter planes at the same time. You can easily catch up with the enemy because of the massive and powerful engine with its afterburner. However, keep an eye on the fuel; the afterburner burns a ton of fuel when active, so if you plan on actively using it, it would be to fill the fuel tank up to full. The plane also features a ballistic computer and two 30 mm autocannons, with excellent ammo selection, which can rip apart any plane you'll face in battle. The Su-7BMK can perform well in a 1-vs-1 scenario, but if it encounters multiple enemy planes, it will have problems (especially if your enemy is equipped with air-to-air missiles). The best strategy is to have a teammate close to you, so you will have some cover if things go wrong.
