Usage of Pe-2-205: 
The Peshka offers many options in combat depending on the loadout. As a dive bomber, the Pe-2 can use its high diving speed to quickly strike at some targets from high altitude, building up enough speed in the dive to evade interception and return to friendly airspace. The Pe-2 can also perform as a level bomber if there are too many enemies at low altitude to safely dive-bomb, although the small payload is not efficient against bases. The 500 kg FAB-500 bomb is the most effective bomb against bases and pillboxes from high altitude. Finally, the Pe-2 can equip RS-132 rockets with air-burst fuses and utilize them against enemy bombers, thanks to its high performance and bomber altitude spawn. The RBS-132 rockets are most effective in Ground Realistic Battles due to the better-modelled damage mechanics against tanks there.
