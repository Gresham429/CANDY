History of LaGG-3-34: 
These planes were used during the battle of Stalingrad with great success against enemy bombers. However, recoil and centre of gravity issues plagued the plane, and the extra weight caused them to suffer from worse performance than other LaGG-3s, which were already somewhat underpowered. The fact that the Il-2s were considered just as effective against ground targets, and the test flight of the Yak-9T which proved a much better platform for the NS-37 gun, spelt the end to this variant of the LaGG-3 with only 40 being produced.
