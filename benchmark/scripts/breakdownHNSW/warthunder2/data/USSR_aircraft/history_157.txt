History of Yak-38: 
The Cold War era saw intense rivalry between the Western and Eastern blocs, not only in the political and ideological spheres but also in the military domain. A key aspect of this competition involved the development of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which could operate from short runways and eventually from aircraft carriers. Several countries, such as France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, participated in these efforts and produced various prototypes and operational models of VTOL aircraft. However, the Soviet Union was initially reluctant to join this race, as it had a different strategic doctrine and a vast network of airfields. It was not until the late 1950s that the Soviet deputy minister, Dmitri Ustinov, recognized the value of VTOL technology and commissioned a new research platform for their own VTOL aircraft development. Yakovlev OKB (Experimental Design Bureau) was the only design bureau that showed interest in the project and was assigned the task.
