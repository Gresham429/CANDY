Description of MiG-21PFM: 
The MiG-21 (NATO Code: Fishbed) was a Soviet jet designed with the intent of replacing the older generation of subsonic fighters, which were becoming outdated and outperformed by their Western counterparts. It was developed in the 1950s and quickly became the most produced supersonic aircraft in history, with over 11,000 units built. The MiG-21 played a significant role in various conflicts around the world and was widely exported to many countries due to its affordability and effectiveness. The MiG-21PF series of aircraft was specialized for all-weather interception. It featured improved radar and avionics systems, allowing it to operate effectively in adverse weather conditions and at night. The aim of this series of aircraft was to mitigate potential dangers posed by enemy bombers and other high-altitude aircraft. Among these was the MiG-21PFM variant, which further enhanced the capabilities of the MiG-21PF series. It underwent various improvements and reductions, including the elimination of an internally mounted gun and an inflated fuselage section. As a result, the aircraft relied on a GP-9 gun pod mounted on the belly as well as external armaments like missiles and rockets.
