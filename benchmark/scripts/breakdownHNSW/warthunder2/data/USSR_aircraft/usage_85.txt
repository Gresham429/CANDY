Usage of Pe-2-110: 
The Pe-2-110 still lacks in defensive armament, with a rear-facing 12.7 mm being your main deterrent (the 7.62 mm side MGs don't offer much damage output or arc of fire). The front-facing armament still isn't impressive, but it's capable of strafing out open-top targets such as unaware SPAA or light vehicles such as the R3 T20 FA-HS, as well as being somewhat effective against fighters. Having allies about is still your best defence.
