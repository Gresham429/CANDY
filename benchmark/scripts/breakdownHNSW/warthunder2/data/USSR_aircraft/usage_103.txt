Usage of Yak-3U: 
Being an improvement on the Yak-3P, one can expect a similar playstyle to the feared Red Soviet Menace, but with more versatility thanks to the improved engine providing a large increase in speed. The Yak-3U provides quite a unique experience, as it can out-turn the enemies it can't out-run, and it can outrun the enemies it can't out-turn, so a smart pilot will use this versatility to their advantage. One should stick with energy fighting for the most part, but can certainly turn-fight with less manoeuvrable opponents, which include the P-51 line.
