Usage of Su-27: 
The Su-27 is a fairly all-rounded aircraft, capable of of performing both air superiority and close air support duties, with the aircraft excelling at the former due to its ability to carry a massive arsenal of close to medium range air-to-air missiles like the potent and reliable R-73 and the manoeuvrable and high speed R-27ER, whilst for more personal and intimate encounters the Su-27 sports a potent wing root 30 mm GSh-30-1 with EEGS integrated. The aircraft also has HMD (Helmet Mounted Display) integrated, allowing the pilot to designate radar lock-on selected target within the HMD's cubical arc which possesses a massive gimbal room. One thing to note is that IR Missile lock is integrated into the HMD, allowing the HMD to lock your R-73s onto your enemies without the need to point your nose to lock, this gave the Su-27 a massive advantage in dogfights especially against opponents that lacked the same technology.
