Usage of MiG-23ML: 
The MiG-23ML is very versatile and has usefulness in nearly every combat situation. In air battles, the MiG-23ML can carry six short-range air-to-air missiles, or four of them with two medium-range air-to-air missiles. The best air-to-air missiles for the plane are the R-60 and R-24. While the R-13 and R-23 can be useful, they are inferior to their counterparts in every way. One interesting trait of the MiG-23ML is that the IRST used with the R-23T or R-24T can wipe out unsuspecting enemies, especially towards the beginning of the match. The R-60s, while excellent at turning, have a shorter range than similar short-range missiles. The plane has very good energy retention and has some of the best flight performance out of any plane at its BR.
