Usage of Su-2_MV-5: 
Much of the fast ground attack gameplay from the previous BB-1 remains the same with the Su-2, with the notable difference of having 10 mm armour plating around the gunner's station. This single difference means that survival of the gunner against rifle-calibre fire is drastically improved, allowing you a greater chance to keep on shooting back.
