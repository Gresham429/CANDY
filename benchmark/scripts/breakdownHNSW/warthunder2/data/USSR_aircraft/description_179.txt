Description of Su-25SM3: 
After the gradual decline of the post-Soviet economy in Russia, the Su-25T and its subsequent TM modernizations were cancelled due to high costs. Instead, a more "affordable" modernization was ordered to be developed. Sukhoi OKB faced multiple delays in this project, mainly due to the merging of Sukhoi with multiple other manufacturers such as Mikoyan and Illyushin into the nationalized "UAC" (United Aircraft Corporation) in 2006 to save costs even further. Eventually, the first Su-25SMs started entering service gradually, with initial batches being older Su-25 airframes upgraded to the SM standard rather than newly built airframes. However, the SM upgrade package mainly focused on making the Su-25 "cheap" rather than modern, with most of the upgrades being tailored to extend the service life and increase reliability while dropping operational costs. It would not be until 2018 that the new Su-25SM3 variant would enter service, being the first real "upgrade" to the modern Su-25 fleet. The SM3 featured the new SPO-150L "Pastel" radar warning receiver, along with an expanded countermeasures suite involving a new set of dispensers and the options for multiple ECM pods to be mounted. Since the Ka-50's ShkvalÂ targeting system (as used on the Su-25T) was too expensive and outdated, the Klen-PS targeting system of the original Su-25 was replaced with the SOLT-25 thermal tracking sight, with up to 16x zoom. The Su-25SM3 would see trial by fire almost instantly after entering service, being deployed by the Russian VVS for ground strike missions during the intervention in the Syrian Civil War. Experience gained from combat in Syria resulted in the final set of upgrades to the SM3 standard; the addition of a PrNK-25SM-1 "Bars" targeting and navigation system, and an SVP-24 ballistic bombing computer.
