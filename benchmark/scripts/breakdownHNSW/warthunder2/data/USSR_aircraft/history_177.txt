History of MiG-29SMT: 
After the dissolution of the USSR, the Russian Federation sought to find a replacement for its aging older Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, to match the 4+ and 5th generation capability of its NATO adversaries. The original program for a frontline fighter replacement for the MiG-29, the Mikoyan 1.44, failed due to lack of funding in post-Soviet Russia. Eventually, the Russian Federation would settle for heavily upgrading their existing MiG-29s into 4+ generation standards as a stop-gap solution not only for them, but also for export customers. The resulting project built upon Mikoyan's older Project 9.17A, the original MiG-29SMT from 1996, upgrading it with 21st century avionics and equipment.
