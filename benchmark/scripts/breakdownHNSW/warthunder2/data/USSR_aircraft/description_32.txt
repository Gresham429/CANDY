Description of Po-2M: 
The Po-2M (or Po-2P) was a proposed Soviet biplane intended to be used as a floatplane version of the Po-2. It was developed in the 1940s and was successfully tested at the Khimki water reservoir near Moscow. Due to the requirement to mount a bomb load beneath the lower wings, it was created using a single-float scheme. Apart from that, there were only a few minor differences between it and the land-based version, such as the addition of a spinner to the propeller, hiding the rudder control cables in the fuselage, and a trimming glacis to the elevator. Despite positive test results, it was never put into production. It's very likely that biplane designs were simply considered out of favour at the time, and thus the aircraft never stood a chance.
