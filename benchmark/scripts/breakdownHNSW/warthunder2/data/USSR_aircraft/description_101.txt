Description of Yak-3P: 
The Yakovlev Yak-3P is the second variant of the Yak-3 fighter aircraft family. The Yak-3P, which entered service in 1945, was the most common Yak-3 variant. The initial variant of the Yak-3 was armed with one 20 mm ShVAK cannon and two 12.7mm Berezin UB heavy machine guns; the Yak-3P features serious improvements in firepower. It was equipped with three 20 mm Berezin B-20 cannons (one in M modification and two in S modification), significantly increasing its combat efficiency and turning it into an even more formidable air-to-air fighter aircraft. Production began after World War II, and a total of 596 aircraft were manufactured, but none were ever deployed in battle. The three-cannon armament was 11 kg less than the standard Yak-3, and the one-second burst mass of 3.52 kg was heavier than most of its contemporary counterparts.
