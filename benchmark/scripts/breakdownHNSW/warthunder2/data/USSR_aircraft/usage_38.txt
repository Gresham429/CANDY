Usage of Yak-9: 
Both "Universal" and "Stealth" ammo belts for the cannon are effective against all planes, and the "Ground Targets" belt gives the most HE rounds for most targets. The cannon's "Ground Targets" belt is also capable of penetrating light tanks if the player hits them in the rear. Low gun ammo along with no other ordnance of any kind (no rockets and bombs of any kind) make this plane weak against even soft unarmoured ground targets.
