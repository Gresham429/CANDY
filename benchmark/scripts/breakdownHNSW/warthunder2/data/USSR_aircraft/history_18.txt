History of Yak-2_KABB: 
The Yak-2 KABB was a ground attack version of the Yak-2 light bomber (not available in game) designed by George Mozharovsky and Ivan Venevidov (MV), who were two renowned designers of aircraft armament. They specialized in developing and building many variants of reloading systems, targeting sights, weapon suspensions systems, bomb deployment mounts and the "MV" series of aircraft gun turrets. In late 1940, Mozharovsky and Venevidov invented a new type of gun mount for attack aircraft called the "комбинированной артиллерийско-бомбардировочной батареей" (Russian for "Combined artillery-bomb battery") or KABB for short which was mounted to the ventral side of the aircraft. The premise behind this gun mount was it utilized two 20 mm ShVAK cannons and two ShKAS machine guns and the cannons could be pivoted mechanically from horizontal to downside of a maximum of 30 degrees. The cannons pivoted electrically while they were connected to the K-8T gun sight which pivoted mechanically tracking with the cannons, automatically adjusting as the cannons moved. The cannons could be fixed at an intermediate position between the 0 and 30-degree range. This system allowed the pilot to maintain horizontal flight and set up for his bombing run while suppressing the target with cannon fire at the same time. Hence the name for "combined artillery-bomb battery."
