History of Yak-38M: 
As the Soviet navy received the last batches of the original Yak-38, it increasingly became evident that the aircraft suffered from a multitude of issues and constraints, which significantly impeded its operational efficacy. These issues prompted the Soviet authorities to initiate a modernization program, and a government decree on August 27, 1981, authorized the development of the Yak-38M, an improved version of the Yak-38 with enhanced performance and capabilities. The main upgrade in the Yak-38M was the installation of new engines, the Tumansky R-28V-300 and Rybinsk RD-38, which increased the thrust and reduced the overheating problems of the previous model. The new engines also allowed the Yak-38M to increase its maximum takeoff weight in VTOL mode from 10,300 kg to 11,300 kg and to 12,000 kg in short takeoff mode; however, the target figures were not finally achieved. Other changes included a new avionics and weapon suite, provision for drop tanks, and minor improvements in the navigation systems. Even so, the Yak-38M still had trouble achieving its desired performance targets. Due to its payload and performance limitations, the aircraft was still referred to as a "moral support aircraft", despite noticeable improvements in engine thrust and fewer overheating problems. By 1988, only 50 of these aircraft had been produced, and their fate was sealed by the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the ensuing budget cuts. Most of the carriers that carried them were either scrapped or sold, and the last Yak-38Ms flew from the Baku carrier until they were relegated to land-based training missions. However, these missions were short-lived, as the Yak-38s were retired for good in early 1993.
