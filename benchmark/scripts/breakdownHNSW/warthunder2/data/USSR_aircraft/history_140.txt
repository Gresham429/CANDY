History of IL-28Sh: 
Development work on the IL-28Sh (Sh = Shturmovik; attacker) began in 1967 after it became clear that the main fighter-bomber of the Soviet air force, the MiG-15, had insufficient combat loads. As a result of this, Soviet engineers once more began looking into the possibility of converting some IL-28 bombers into attack aircraft. This resulted in the creation of the IL-28Sh, a regular IL-28 modified to fit 12 external pylons suspended underneath the wings. This allowed the IL-28Sh to carry, in addition to its standard internal payloads, a large number of suspended ordnance options ranging from rocket-and gunpods to additional bombs.
