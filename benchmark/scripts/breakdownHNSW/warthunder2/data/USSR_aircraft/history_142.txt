History of Tu-14T: 
The Tu-14 'Bosun' was a Soviet jet-powered torpedo bomber, built in small numbers in the early 1950s. Initially designed as a competitor to the Ilyushin IL-28 'Beagle', the Tu-14 failed to generate sufficient interest and was thereafter redesigned as a torpedo bomber. Due to the low priority of naval aircraft in the Soviet military command, only small numbers of Tu-14s were built. The Tu-14 served as the primary Soviet land-based torpedo bomber until 1961, and served secondary duties until 1970.[1] Only 88 aircraft were built.[1]
