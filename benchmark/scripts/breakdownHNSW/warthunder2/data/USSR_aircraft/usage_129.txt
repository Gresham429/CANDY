Usage of Yak-15: 
In Realistic battles, climbing with this aircraft at the start of a match is not always the best course of action, considering how poor the Yak-15's rate of climb is. Instead of the traditional, slow angled climb the Yak-15 is best used in a "zoom climb" where once enough energy has been built up at a low altitude the Yak-15 pilot will pitch up, thus gaining a lot of altitude quickly. This way, if attacked during the first few minutes of the match, the Yak-15 still wields some energy whereas had the Yak-15 been slowly climbing, it would have had to face another aircraft's guns. In order to shake an enemy, especially a prop driven enemy, dive low to the ground to ensure your assailant's speed only decreases. This is called a "speed trap" and can either be followed by a "hammerhead" attack or a continuation of the escape. This tactic of utilizing the Yak-15's ability to hold on to energy in a straight line is negated when facing other jet aircraft who wield the same ability. This is where the Yak-15's dog fighting abilities come into play. Because it is so similar to the Yak-3, the Yak-15 retains some of its manoeuvrability characteristics, namely its turn time. This facet often proves an indispensable one as other first generation jets will not be able to maintain a tight enough turn circle. This allows the Yak-15 to outperform even the best-turning first-generation jets such as the Ho 299 and the Vampire(s), as long as you have an energy advantage.
