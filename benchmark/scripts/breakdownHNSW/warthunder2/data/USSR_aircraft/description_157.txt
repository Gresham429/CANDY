Description of Yak-38: 
During the late 1960s, Yakovlev Design Bureau set out to build the Soviet Union's first VTOL fighter, after witnessing the success of the Hawker P.1154 VTOL testbed from Great Britain. Initially lacking funding for research and development of proper VTOL technology, Yakovlev presented the Yak-36 created with what little they had. The Yak-36 was a failure by most metrics, with only four built and only one performing VTOL flight, which later crashed in testing. However, to Yakovlev it was a massive success, as this design convinced the Soviet government to fund the development of a proper Soviet VTOL program. Yakovlev presented a supersonic design with swivelling nozzles similar to those found on the Harrier family, but this was deemed too complex and expensive. Instead, the Soviet government ordered a simpler, cheaper VTOL aircraft primarily for naval operation aboard their new Project 1143 Heavy Aircraft Cruisers. This new aircraft would be limited in speed to Mach 0.95, and would function as both a fleet defence fighter, armed with air-to-air missiles for interception, and also as a naval strike fighter, carrying a multitude of both guided and unguided ordnance. Yakovlev OKB got to work, and on September 22nd, 1970, the first prototype of the Yak-38 performed its maiden flight. However, with new technology came many problems, and the Yak-38 would be plagued by an unacceptable amount of issues, which took many years to fix, before the Yak-38 officially entered service six years later in 1976.
