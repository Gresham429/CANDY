Usage of IL-2_M-82: 
The IL-2 M-82's effective frontal armament and excellent loadout options make it an excellent ground attacker in both Air and Mixed battles. Its lacking flight characteristics and slow top speed make it unsuitable for air-to-air engagements, as it will be quickly shredded by enemy fighters.
