Usage of TIS_MA: 
A versatile plane, the TIS MA lends itself to several roles, mainly limited by its bad high altitude performance and the fact that it's still a twin-engined, heavy aircraft. Throwing oneself incautiously at lightweight planes with superior turning or climbing capabilities will often not end well.
