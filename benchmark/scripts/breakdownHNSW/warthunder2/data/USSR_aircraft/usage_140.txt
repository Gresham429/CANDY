Usage of IL-28Sh: 
The IL-28Sh is an extremely versatile aircraft, thanks to its extensive suspended ordnance options. The aircraft can be used as a bomber, or as a CAS aircraft with its rockets. As well, the IL-28Sh gets access to a powerful forward-firing and defensive set of 23 mm cannons, which can be further augmented by a pair of UPK-23-250 gunpods each carrying a GSh-23L cannon - combined, these can provide a forward firing burst mass of over 25 kilograms, which is the highest burst mass of any aircraft at its BR.
