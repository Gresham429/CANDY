Description of Yak-15P: 
By 1946, the Yakovlev "Yak-Jumo" project to build a single-engine jet fighter with a reverse-engineered Junkers Jumo 004 engine (dubbed the RD-10) hammered into the existing Yak-3 fuselage was well underway, but a few setbacks meant that the full production variant, the Yak-15, could not be fully produced in the required numbers for the October Revolution Air Parade on November 7th. As such, a special variant was quickly ordered for the parade, with much of the unnecessary/untested parts being left out to save time. As such, this special Yak-15 was missing the armour plating and quite a few instruments and avionics, and these aircraft were not even fitted with guns. Some planes had extra fuel tanks installed where the missing guns were supposed to be. Finally, these 15 aircraft were given a bright-red paint scheme for the parade. To save time as the program was already behind schedule, shortly after the parade two of these aircraft were quickly fitted with armour and a single NS-23 23 mm cannon to begin state acceptance trials.
