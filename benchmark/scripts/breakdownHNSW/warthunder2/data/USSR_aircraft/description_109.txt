Description of IL-10: 
After a failed attempt to develop the IL-1, a "lightweight" fighter/ground attacker version of the IL-2, the Ilyushin design bureau decided in 1944 to repurpose the IL-1 into a "modernized" version of the "Sturmovik". As such, the Ilyushin IL-10 was the result of the experience of the Ilyushin design bureau in an attempt to make a worthy successor of the famous IL-2M ground attack aircraft. In its initial form, the IL-10 was essentially a sleek, more aerodynamically efficient version of the IL-2, while retaining most of its main armaments. The IL-10 was tested against Sukhoi's Su-6 in a contest for a replacement of the IL-2. While the Su-6 could carry more payload compared to the IL-10 (that has its payload reduced due to its lightweight design), the IL-10 offered greater overall agility and top speed, and as such was chosen as the winner of the competition. The initial serial production of the IL-10 saw combat during the last stages of the war in Europe, before being re-outfitted in 1946 with improved armaments.
