Description of MiG-3-34: 
The MiG-3-34 was an experimental variant of the MiG-3 series, that tried to address the relatively weak firepower that previous models had. The MiG-3-34 was meant to be a high-altitude fighter, and was one of the few Soviet fighters capable of doing so, but still not at the level of American or German fighters like the P-51 and Bf 109. The MiG-3 suffered from a lot of problems in its development, from negligent quality control in the assembly line to deficient armament and poor oxygen supply. The MiG-3 was caught in a tough spot during Operation Barbarossa: instead of intercepting bombers, it clashed against much more agile Bf 109s. The aircraft was deemed much inferior and quickly phased out in favour of more capable low altitude Yak and LaGG fighters.
