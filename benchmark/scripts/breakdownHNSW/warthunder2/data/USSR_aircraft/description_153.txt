Description of Su-7BKL: 
The Su-7BKL was produced in large numbers, with a total of 700 units built. This makes it the most produced variant of the Su-7 design. The Su-7BKL was an upgrade over the Su-7B variant. It required less runway for takeoff and landings in both paved and dirt. The aircraft featured rocket boosters to decrease the amount of time required to takeoff, reducing the distance to 800 m, which was considerably less than the 1,250 m of the Su-7B. It also had an improved landing chute and a stronger rear landing gear. It was produced up to 1971 when it was replaced by the Su-17. It also received an export variant, Su-7BMK, produced until 1965 for countries outside of the Warsaw pact.
