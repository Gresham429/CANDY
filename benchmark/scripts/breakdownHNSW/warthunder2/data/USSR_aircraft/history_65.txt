History of I-29: 
In 1938, at the design bureau of A. S. Yakovlev, they began to work out a project modelling a new wooden two-seater plane with two M-103 engines with a capacity of 960 litres each. This aircraft was to be versatile which could be adopted in service in one of three versions: a fighter, high-speed bomber and a close-support reconnaissance aircraft.
