Description of I-180S: 
The I-180S was an attempt by the Polikarpov Design Bureau to extract more performance out of the I-16's airframe. The aircraft had a troubled development, including the death of one of its test pilots in a prototype. The aircraft was meant to fulfil the requirements for a new interceptor with a radial engine. The aircraft suffered problems with the engines and the propeller, being armed with a set of 2 x 12.7 mm Berezin BS and 2 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns over the engine. The cancellation of the I-180S is attributed by some historians to the intentions of promoting younger designers over Polikarpov, as well as favouritism in the high spheres of influence of the Soviet Union.
