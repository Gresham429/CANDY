History of Su-22M3: 
The Su-22M3 is one of the variants of the Su-17 strike aircraft series designed for export. A distinctive feature of the project was the adaptation of the Su-17M3 airframe for the installation of the Tumansky R-29BS-300 engine, similar to the exported MiG-23's R-29-300. It was assumed that the engine, familiar to foreign operators, would simplify the service and operation of the aircraft. Unlike the earlier simplified commercial versions, the Su-22M3 modification had avionics completely unified with the Su-17M3. The machine was produced in 1982-83 in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, a total of 70 Su-22M3 units were built. These fighter-bombers were delivered to Hungary, Syria, and Iraq.
