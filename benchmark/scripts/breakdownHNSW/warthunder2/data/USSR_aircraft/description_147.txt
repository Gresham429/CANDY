Description of Yak-30D: 
The Yak-30 was Yakovlev's attempt to compete with Mikoyan-Gurevich after the limited success of the Yak-23 and all their jets using the Yak-3 fuselage. The Yak-30 was a completely new design based on the experimental Yak-25, however this variant included a swept wing for better performance at high speeds. The aircraft test trials started after its first flight in 1948 but it proved unsatisfactory, thus a new version with most of the problems fixed was developed, the Yak-30D. This new variant showed good results but the superior MiG-15 was already in production and thus the project was cancelled.
