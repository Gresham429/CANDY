Usage of Yer-2_(M-105): 
The Yer-2 (M-105) was an impressive aircraft for its time, considering that it was still able to fly while carrying its hefty bombload. (Although there was a crash of the prototype, which was designated Stal-7, during takeoff. This led to the arrest of the original designer before Yermolaev undertook the design.) In Arcade battles, the weight of the aircraft doesn't affect the gameplay too much. However, that's a different story for players who play this aircraft in Air RB. The weight of the bomb-load significantly affects the performance of the aircraft, making it a pain to fly to its destination because it has a subpar climb rate, and is painfully slow (stock: average of ~263 km/h at 5,000 m). Luckily, this is a long range bomber, and this allows you to spawn at an altitude of 4,000 m. The player should not start diving immediately because the slow speed and the lack of defensive armaments on the aircraft makes this aircraft an easy target for enemy fighters, especially for those with 8 x .50 cal machine guns. As a long range bomber, your best ally would be altitude. The higher you are, the more chance you have at surviving (enemy aircraft would usually leave you alone when you're at 5,000 m). Avoid flying into the middle of the battlefield to improve your chances. Try taking routes around the map and far from the battle because it won't be long before fighters start appearing at your rear. If an enemy does appear on your six, drop your bomb-load immediately at the target and return to base. If you weren't able to do so, return to the base anyway. Cut your engines (if your altitude is at least 4,000 m) and start diving to the direction of the airbase, this will diminish the chances of causing a fire, and pray that you're able to take him down before they do the same to you.
