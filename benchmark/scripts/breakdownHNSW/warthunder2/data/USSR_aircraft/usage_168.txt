Usage of Su-25T: 
The Su-25T Frogfoot is best suited for ground attack in general, using similar low and fast passes. The new guided munitions are more complicated than the rocket-slinging favoured by earlier Frogfoots, but can cause more damage once the pilot gets used to the workflow of target acquisition and launch authorization. The Vikhr missiles in particular have best-in-class capacity (16x) and are unlikely to run out before the sortie ends from other factors. It's also very survivable thanks to its sturdy airframe, often shrugging off hits from MANPADS like Stingers. However in Ground RB, the Su-25T's flight performance makes it uniquely vulnerable to SAMs compared to supersonic strike aircraft; even SAMs with erratic flight profiles can catch a subsonic Frogfoot without too much trouble. Pay careful attention to the RWR. Generally it is a bad idea to engage a SAM in a head-on attack, but if there is no alternative, salvo-fire a pair of spaced Vikhrs so that one of them will hopefully intercept the missile.
