Description of Su-7B: 
The Su-7B was the first mass-produced variant of the Su-7. After the introduction of the Su-7, the fighter was reclassified as a fighter/bomber and the production was changed to the Su-7B. This strike aircraft was meant to fill the role of a fast fighter/bomber in the new Soviet Air Force doctrine of lightning strikes deep in enemy territory against NATO. The Su-7 was later improved and replaced by more newer variants, such as the Su-7BM and the Su-7BKL which was the most produced variant.
