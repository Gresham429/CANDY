History of Yak-9U: 
During December 1943, the creation of a new airframe (Yak-9U) allowed the installation of the M-107A engine, which was more powerful than the previous VK-105PF. The engine mount was brand new and included individual faired exhaust pipes, wings, and fuselage structure that was made of metal while the whole aircraft received a covering of Bakelite skin. The horizontal tail surfaces were slightly reduced in order to afford the aircraft improved pitch control. The oil cooler intake was re-positioned from beneath the nose to the port wing root as well as an enlarged radiator bath being moved further aft under the fuselage. A supercharger intake was centred on the top decking of the engine cowling. The rear antenna cable was moved inside a lengthened rear canopy which featured a more aerodynamically refined shape with a modified fuselage deck contour. The typical armament of the Yak-9U was a 20 mm (79 cal) ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds that was fired through the aircraft's hollow propeller shaft, and two 12.7 mm (50 cal) Berezin UB machine guns with 340 rounds.
