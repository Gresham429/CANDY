Description of Su-25K: 
During the early 1970s, it was noted that the Soviet Air Force's CAS capabilities were very underwhelming compared to their adversaries. The ground attack variants of the MiG-21 and MiG-23 lacked sufficient armour, cockpit visibility, and ground ordnance for heavy ground attack missions, whereas the Su-7 and older variants of the Su-17 were deemed "obsolete" and did not meet the requirements of the Red Army. As a result, the Soviet Ministry of Defence announced a new design competition among its design bureaus, for a new heavy-weight subsonic dedicated attacker. In the end, of the promising designs of the Sukhoi T-8 and the Ilyushin IL-102, the Sukhoi design was chosen and ordered into production in 1978 as the "Su-25". The aircraft would enter production just in time to see service in the Soviet-Afghan War the following year. Shortly after it entered production, a slightly modified variant with cheaper/simpler electronics was devised for export, titled the Su-25K.
