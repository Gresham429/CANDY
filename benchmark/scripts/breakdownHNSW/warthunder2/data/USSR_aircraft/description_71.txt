Description of Yak-9K: 
The Yakovlev Yak-9K was a modified subvariant of the Yak-9T, which was the second variant of the Yakovlev-9 fighter aircraft family. The Yak-9K was an attempt to increase firepower over the standard Yak-9T by arming it with a 45 mm NS-45 cannon with 29 rounds and a characteristic muzzle brake to deal with the severe recoil. However, firing the gun at speeds less than 350 km/h still resulted in a significant recoil that led to loss of control of the aircraft and flung the pilot back and forth in the cockpit. Accurate firing was only possible at faster speeds and in bursts of two to three rounds. The cannon's high recoil produced several oil and coolant leaks. Overall, he large gun significantly reduced flight performance, particularly at high altitudes, to the point where Yak-9Ks were only assigned to heavy fighter duties and were required to be escorted by Yak-3s in case of failure. The Yak-9K saw limited use due to the unreliability of the 45 mm cannon and airframe structural instability issues caused by the recoil; it also saw limited production as German bombers gradually decreased in number later in World War II.
