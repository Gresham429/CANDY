Description of La-15: 
Shortly after the end of WWII in Europe, the Soviet Union outlined the design requirements for a future fighter aircraft powered using their newfound jet technology from the Germans. As a result, many of the well-established design bureaus of the time began work on a indigenous jet fighter. Sukhoi began studies with their Aircraft K prototype, Mikoyan began working on their I-310 prototype, Yakovlev started the Yak-15 family, and not to be left behind Lavochkin initiated Project 52, a proposal for a jet powered fighter-interceptor drawing from the captured plans and designs of the German Ta-183 which was never built. Project 52 differed from the MiG-15 and later Yak-30, as the project was for not one, but two aircraft. These two aircraft were designated Aircraft 174 and Aircraft 174D, the only difference being that 174 used the reverse engineered Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, while the latter 174D used the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. In the end, the Derwent (redesignated as the Klimov RD-500) powered prototype was chosen to enter production as the La-15. The La-15 would enter service officially in 1949 and 235 of the type would be produced, before production (and service) was cut short when it was retired quickly in 1953 due the advent of more advanced aircraft with supersonic capability, such as the new MiG-19 and two years later, the first prototypes of the MiG-21.
