Description of PBY-5A_Catalina_(USSR): 
The Catalina was the Soviet Union's main naval reconnaissance aircraft and naval bomber during and after the Second World War. It was so popular in fact that bombers meant to replace it, like the Be-6, never fully managed to fulfil its role. The Soviet Union received a total of 185 Catalinas of the two main variants in the Lend-Lease program. The Catalinas received by the Soviet Union were both the amphibious variants and those with tricycle landing gear. The Catalinas arrived to the Soviet Union in 1944 and gained good reputation in Soviet naval aviation, however they were finally fully retired from military service between 1954 and 1957. They served for many years as naval bombers and rescue aircraft.
