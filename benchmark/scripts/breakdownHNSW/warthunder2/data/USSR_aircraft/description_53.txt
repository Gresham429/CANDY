Description of DB-3B: 
The Ilyushin DB-3 (Дальний бомбардировщик - Long-range Bomber) was introduced in the Soviet Union in 1936 and quickly became the core of the Soviet long-range bomber fleet. The aircraft carried up to 2,000 kg of bombs and had three 7.62mm ShKAS machine guns for defensive armament. It was powered by two Mikulin M-85 engines, each producing 850 horsepower, allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 390 km/h and giving it a range of more than 2,000 kilometers. During the early stages of World War II, the DB-3 aircraft played a decisive role due to its specialized use in night bombing missions against German targets, resulting in significant damage to infrastructure and military installations. Its long-range capability allowed it to penetrate deep into enemy territory, making it a valuable asset for air raids. The DB-3B variant represented an upgrade over the original model. In line with the typical Soviet upgrade initiatives of that time, the objective was to outfit the aircraft with more powerful engines, specifically the Tumansky M-87A/B, which boosted the maximum engine power to 950 hp.
