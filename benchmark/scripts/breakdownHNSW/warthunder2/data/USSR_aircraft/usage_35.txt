Usage of Yak-1: 
Due to the Yak-1's manoeuvrability and armament, the main role will be employed as a fighter in the game. The Yak-1 can be used as a turn fighter (see next section for aircraft to avoid while turn fighting), boom & zoomer or energy fighter. The Yak-1 performs well in the mid to lower altitudes but loses mobility in the higher altitudes.
