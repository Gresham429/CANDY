Usage of Yak-9U: 
The Yak-9U offers incredible speed, acceleration, climb and manoeuvrability with the same complementary firepower. Unlike its VK-105 powered predecessors, which suffered significant power loss above 3,500 m, the VK-107 engine of the Yak-9U retains decent performance up to 5,000 m, allowing you to partake in the initial dogfight of a match without being at a massive disadvantage. Once the air battle has gone down to a lower altitude, your engine performance will go from good to incredible. With a sea level top speed of nearly 600 km/h there's not many planes that can catch or outrun you. Your acceleration, climb rate and energy retention are superior to most other aircraft as well. The turn rate, while not top notch, is still better than a good portion of your competition.
