Usage of Su-25K: 
The Su-25K is a support plane. It is a slow plane compared to most other planes, therefore altitude is important since you are likely to Boom and Zoom. You need to look around constantly to prevent unexpected attacks. Your main worries will be planes like the A-5C or the F-5C. Those planes are fast and can dogfight you. Gain altitude and pick on unsuspecting targets. Your R-60MK missiles are very good but shooting them at 3 km distance will be the most efficient. You can also save your missiles if you're caught in a head-on, or you can spray your guns. If you see tough enemies which are alert of your presence, try engaging them first.
