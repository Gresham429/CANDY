Usage of IL-4: 
The IL-4 should be played similarly to its predecessor, the DB-3B. The aircraft's main advantage is its large collection of suspended armaments, meaning that it can be used quite effectively in multiple roles. In Air Battles, the IL-4 should be used as a fast bomber, delivering its payload to bases then retreating to avoid interception. The aircraft could also be used, in a niche role, as a torpedo bomber - as one of the few Soviet aircraft capable of carrying torpedoes, the IL-4 can easily destroy naval vessels in both Air and Naval battles.
