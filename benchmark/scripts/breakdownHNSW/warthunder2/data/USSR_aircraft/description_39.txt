Description of Yak-9B: 
The Yakovlev Yak-9B was a modified subvariant of the Yak-9D, which was the third variant of the Yak-9 fighter aircraft family. The Yak-9B was a fighter-bomber configuration of the Yak-9D (factory official designation Yak-9L) with four vertical tube bomb bays aft of the cockpit capable of carrying up to four 100 kg FAB-100 bombs or four PTAB cassettes with 32 1.5 kg bomblets each, though only 200 kg of weapons were normally carried. The Yak-9D was a longer-range variant of the standard Yak-9, with a fuel capacity increase from 440 to 650 litres and a maximum range of 1,400 km. Since the Soviet Army went on the offensive in 1943, covering operational advances from the air required an increased number of fighters. The Yak-9D underwent modifications to produce the Yak-9B, which could carry bombs, but this modification did not result in mass production as the Yak-9B armed with bombs had poor manoeuvrability, limiting its combat effectiveness against other fighters. Furthermore, the lack of bomb-aiming equipment made bomb targeting inaccurate.
