Description of Su-6: 
The development of the Su-6 began in 1939 when the Sukhoi design bureau started working on a single-seat ground attack aircraft. The performance of the Su-6 was overall superior to the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft, unfortunately the radial engine powering the Su-6 exceeded its age limit before the testing was completed and thus no more engines were available for the aircraft to enter mass production. Thanks to combat experience with the Il-2s, later prototypes were designed with a rear gunner using 12.7 mm Berezin UBT machine gun protecting the rear hemisphere of the aircraft. This meant a decreased bomb load and to counter this, a more powerful engine was installed, the Shvetsov M-71F radial engine. Overall, the Su-6 was faster than the Il-2, however at the expense of carrying a smaller bomb load, the Su-6 never reached production, thanks to its late development and the introduction of the Il-10.
