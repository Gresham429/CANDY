Usage of Tu-1: 
In RB, the aircraft is given a strike fighter spawn, meaning it does not have as much room to dive and gain speed as a bomber. The Tu-1 is capable of destroying enemy fighters in head-on engagements or unsuspecting attackers, thanks to its 23 mm and 45 mm cannons. For usage in combined forces, the Tu-1 makes for a very potent attacker, carrying three 1,000 kg bombs as well as the pair of 45 mm cannons having the option to fire API-T rounds, which can knock out all but the heaviest tanks at its BR from the tops and sides.
