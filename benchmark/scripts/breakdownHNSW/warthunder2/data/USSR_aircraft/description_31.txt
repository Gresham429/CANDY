Description of MBR-2-M-34: 
The MBR-2-M-34 was a Soviet multi-purpose flying boat designed with the intent of carrying out maritime patrol missions for the Soviet Navy. It was developed in the 1930s by Beriev OKB, with Georgy Mikhailovich Beriev at the helm of the design, and was widely used during World War II. The MBR-2-M-34 had a range of over 1,000 kilometres and was armed with various offensive weapons, such as machine guns and bombs. The name "MBR-2-M-34" stems from the aircraft's engine, the AM-34NB, which significantly enhanced its performance and reliability. Due to its versatility, the MBR-2-M-34 was well-suited for not only maritime patrol but also for use as a light bomber and even a submarine hunter. Its sturdy construction allowed it to withstand harsh weather conditions, making it well suited for maritime operations. It most likely served with the Soviet Navy until the end of World War II, at which point it started to be gradually phased out.
