Usage of Yak-3P: 
The Yak-3P is much the same as the Yak-3, however it has some differences such as armament, instead of the one cannon and two machine guns. It has no secondary armament, thus using it as a ground attacker or bomber is not advisable, it lacks the ordnance to perform that role. It should only be used as a fighter, using the boom and zoom tactic, to dominate and own the battlefield of the deep blue sky. A Yak-3P is equipped with three cannons, two B-20S and a single engine mounted B-20M.
