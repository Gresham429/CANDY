History of Su-25BM: 
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an abundance of ex-Soviet strategic weapons (ICBMs, MIRVs, nuclear weapons, and strategic bombers) scattered throughout the ex-socialist republics. One of them was Kazakhstan, which had already quit the Union by October 1990. They returned the 40 Tu-95MS (13 MS-16 and 27 MS-6 respectively; where 7 of them were dismantled in Kazakhstan due to poor condition) of the 79th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division which was stationed at Dolon Airbase to Russia in 1992, as well as 370 tactical missiles with nuclear warheads; this in turn became a deal between Kazakhstan and Russia that some of the units from the Turkmenistan Military District would be returned to Kazakhstan in 1995, as well as new units including 12 Su-25 and 2 Su-25UB. These 14 aircraft were assigned to the (602nd) Chimkent Air Base as part of the composition of the newly-born Kazakh ADF.
