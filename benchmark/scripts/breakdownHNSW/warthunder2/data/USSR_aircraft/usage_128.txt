Usage of Yak-15P: 
In Realistic battles, climbing with this aircraft at the start of a match is not always the best course of action, considering how poor the Yak-15P's rate of climb is. Instead of the traditional and slow angled climb, the Yak-15P is best used in a "zoom climb" where once enough energy has been built up at a low altitude the Yak-15P pilot will pitch up, thus gaining altitude quickly. This way, if attacked during the first few minutes of the match, the Yak-15P still wields some energy whereas had the Yak-15P been slowly climbing, it would have had to face another aircraft's guns. To shake an enemy, especially a prop driven enemy, dive low to the ground to ensure your assailant's speed only decreases. This dive is called a "speed trap" and is effective when followed by either a "hammerhead" attack or a continuation of the escape. This tactic of utilising the Yak-15P's ability to hold on to energy in a straight line is negated when facing other jet aircraft who wield the same ability; however, this is where the Yak-15P's dogfighting abilities come into play. Because it is so similar to the Yak-3, the Yak-15P retains some of its manoeuvrability characteristics, namely its turn time. This facet often proves an indispensable one as other first-generation jets will not be able to maintain a tight enough turn circle.
