History of La-11: 
The Lavochkin La-9 (NATO: Fritz) was among the very last propeller fighters in the world, starting its fairly short life in the VVS in 1946. While the aircraft was still under the prototype name of La-130, VVS suggested that Lavochkin should further improve the range of La-130; the new design, which was rushed out just 6 months after the commission of La-9, was later renamed to La-134, aka La-9M. The new La-9M was tested by A.G. Kochetkov in May 1947, with many modifications over the original La-130 design and most of all, up to 1,130 litres of fuel could be held instead of the original 825l. This meant a 571 kg increase in full-load weight and after flight tests it was concluded that La-9M could perform like a La-9 only when around 600 L of fuel was carried.
