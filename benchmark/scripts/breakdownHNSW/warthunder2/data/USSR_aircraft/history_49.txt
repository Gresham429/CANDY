History of IL-2_(1941): 
The famous IL-2 Shturmovik was a Soviet WWII-era attack aircraft created by the Ilyushin Design Bureau and nicknamed Hunchback by Red Army troops due to the distinct fuselage shape. While the designers nicknamed their aircraft the Flying Tank, Luftwaffe pilots, due to the IL-2's incredible ability to withstand battle damage, instead called it the Betonflugzeug (concrete plane). German ground troops, conversely, despised and feared the IL-2, giving it a slew of unpleasant nicknames, such as Schlachter (butcher); Fleischwulf (meatgrinder); eiserner Gustav (Iron Gustav) and schwarzer Tod (the black death). Some historians believe that the Black Death was actually a successful invention of the Soviet propaganda machine that caught on with the Germans.
