Usage of P-47D-27_(USSR): 
As with the normal P-47D-25, the D-27 can be used one of two modes, first as an excellent Boom & Zoom fighter, using its great energy retention and amazing armament against high flying bombers and fighters. Another option is as a fighter bomber, utilising the impressive payload and adequate diving characteristics of the P-47 (be aware of dropping order of the bombs, the 500 kg bombs drop first and then the 250 kg under the fuselage is dropped). The 500 kg bombs are able to make short work of any tank whether light or heavy in its tier, but the 250 kg bomb can only provide enough explosive power to destroy softer targets, like armoured cars and SPAA. The way both 500 kg bombs drop should either be used against a group of tanks (combined battles) or against large pillboxes. Other than that, the P-47 can be used in multiple roles, unfortunately, using bombs restricts flight to only staying at a low level where the P-47's engine is less effective.
