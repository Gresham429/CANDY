Usage of I-301: 
A good tactic for flying the I-301 is to climb above all your enemies, using your good rate of climb. Once at altitude, you can pick and choose whichever target you want to pursue. Once you pick out a target, dive on it and demolish the enemy with your deadly armament. It is very important to note that if your target turns, do not turn with it. Convert your speed back into altitude, and then dive back on the enemy aircraft. If you are playing in an Arcade Battle, you will want to reload your cannon whenever your ammunition runs below about 25 rounds. Optimally you will be at bomber altitude, where you can take your time, reload and regroup.
