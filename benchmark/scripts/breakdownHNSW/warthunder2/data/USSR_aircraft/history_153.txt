History of Su-7BKL: 
The Su-7BKL is a further improvement of the Su-7B fighter bomber. The main goal was to shorten the take-off and landing distances on both paved and dirt airfields, so the aircraft was fitted with rocket boosters to reduce take-off length by 800 metres, and improved landing chutes with enlarged areas to decrease landing distance by 500 metres. Rear landing gear length was reduced and skis were installed to the wheels, in order to make unpaved airfield landings more effective.
