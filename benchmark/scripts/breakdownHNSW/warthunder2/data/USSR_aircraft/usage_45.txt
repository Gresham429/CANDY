Usage of LaGG-3-35: 
Bomber Hunter: The LaGG-3-35 is a capable bomber hunter especially when using the rockets. Bombers that you would meet will easily disintegrate from a single rocket hit most of the time or be crippled so badly that they will eventually crash. Also the cannon and machine gun on the plane can do damage to enemy bombers as well, it will take some time but eventually the enemy bomber will go down.
