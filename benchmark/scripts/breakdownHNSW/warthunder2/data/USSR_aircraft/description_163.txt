Description of MiG-21bis: 
In 1972, in parallel to the MiG-21SMT and ST variants, a full overhaul of the MiG-21 airframe was being developed around the new Tumansky R-25 engine, which promised a thrust-to-weight ratio of over 1 on full second-stage afterburner when mated to a lightened MiG-21 airframe. The resulting design was given updated avionics and other modernizations, before entering service as the MiG-21bis, the ultimate culmination of the third-generation Fishbed. The MiG-21bis was quickly adopted in the USSR by both the PVO and the VVS, with one minor difference for the two operators. The PVO-flown MiG-21bis was fitted with a Lazur-M GCI (Ground Controlled Interception) guidance system, whereas the VVS-operated variant had a Polyot-OI instrument landing and guidance system outfitted, with the only visual difference between the two variants being a single small antenna under the forward fuselage. The two variants in export were respectively designated as the MiG-21bis Lazur-M (Fishbed-L) and the MiG-21bis-SAU (Fishbed-N) to differentiate them.
