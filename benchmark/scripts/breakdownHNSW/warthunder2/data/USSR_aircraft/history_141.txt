History of Tu-4: 
The Soviet Tu-4 strategic bomber is a copy of the B-29 with more powerful engines and armament. The USSR did not possess strategic aviation capacity in 1945 while having a great requirement for it as the Cold War was about to begin. Several B-29s were forced to land in Soviet territory near Japan after suffering mechanical failures related to the engine cowl flaps, and the B-29s along with their crews were captured on landing. The B-29's that ended up in the hands of Soviet engineers seemed to be a technological miracle and a vast gap between the long-range bomber technologies of the US and the USSR was soon discovered. This lead to a hurried cloning effort while created the Tu-4, a Soviet copy of the American bomber with a few modifications. The Soviets copied the bomber so closely that some Tu-4s had bullet hole patches from the B-29 that weren't meant to be there.
