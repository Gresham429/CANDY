History of I-16_type_10: 
The I-16 Type 10 was the next step in the development of the I-16 series after the Type 5 following the lessons learned by previous combat experience in Spain. Development of the aircraft started in December 1937 with the plane being tested and entering production through the winter, by March 1938 it was already being put into operational service. The main changes when compared to its predecessor are an increase in machine gun armament as well as the ability to mount light ground attack armament, paired with a slight increase in climb rate and speed through the addition of a new M-25V engine (early production models employed the M-25A instead), the addition of flaps, the removal of the closed cockpit and the addition of the PAK-1 reflector sight in place of the OV-1 telescopic sight (note that the later modifications were already seen in late Type 5 production models). Some models were mounted with non-retractable skis in place of the standard retractable landing gear. A total of 934 I-16 Type 10 were built by the time production ended in 1939.
