Description of La-5: 
The La-5 type 37 was a Soviet fighter plane powered by a 1,700 hp Shvetsov M-82A radial engine. It featured two 20 mm ShVAK cannons and had flight characteristics similar to the Bf 109 F. However, it faced issues like cockpit heat, gas contamination, poor cockpit canopy quality, and low speeds due to canopy regulations. Despite these drawbacks, improvements were made throughout production. The La-5 type 37 entered service in 1942 and a total of 1,021 were produced until the end of the year. Further enhancements were needed for it to match the performance of newer German fighters like the Bf 109 G and Fw 190.
