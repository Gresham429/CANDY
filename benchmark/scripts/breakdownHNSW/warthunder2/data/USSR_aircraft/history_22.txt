History of Ar-2: 
The SB-2, the work of aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev, was the one of the world's best bomber when it first flew in 1934. In the Spanish and Chinese battlefields, the SB-2 was so fast that even fighter jets could not catch up. In the late 1930s, the concept of the dive bomber began to appear, and its representative is the famous German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Luftwaffe operations over Poland in the early years of World War II demonstrated that dive-bombing was highly accurate and effective against small, sturdy targets, and the Red Army did not have such aircraft. Therefore, around 1940, the Soviet Army requested the development of a new dive bomber, SB-RK, based on the existing SB-2.
