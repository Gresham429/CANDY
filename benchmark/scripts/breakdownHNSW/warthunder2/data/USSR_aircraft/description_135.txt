Description of MiG-15bis: 
During the early '50s, a design proposal for an upgraded MiG-15 was issued, titled the MiG-15bis (second). The primary upgrade was the new, indigenously developed engine. While the older Klimov RD-45 powering the original MiG-15 was great, it was a reverse-engineered copy of the British Rolls-Royce Nene and as such, had issues with quality and reliability due to the differences in metallurgy and production in the Soviet Union. As such, an in-house variant, named the VK-1, was developed to alleviate these issues, and was also given a larger combustion chamber and turbine, allowing greater induction and airflow in the engine. The MiG-15bis's new engine not only increased its dogfighting performance, but also its weight limits, allowing it to use newer unguided ground ordnance.
