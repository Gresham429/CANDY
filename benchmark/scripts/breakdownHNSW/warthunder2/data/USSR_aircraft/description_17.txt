Description of Pe-3: 
The Petlyakov Pe-3 was a modification of the already-existing Pe-2 dive bomber. It was an attempt to turn the widely available airframe into a heavy/night fighter in response to the rise in night bombings during the early months of Operation Barbarossa. Despite its initial intentions, the Pe-3 was unable to effectively fulfill its role as a night fighter. This was due to the challenges pilots faced when trying to target enemy aircraft: dazzling searchlights and blinding gunfire. Before a solution to this could be found, it was repurposed as a daytime attack aircraft. However, even in this role, it struggled. One notable weakness was its insufficient frontal protection, rendering it susceptible to enemy attacks, which resulted in the significant loss of around 25% of the initial production aircraft. Attempts to bolster the aircraft's armour were initiated, though the ticking clock of World War II posed a problem, preventing the timely completion of this upgrade. Ultimately, a decision materialized to reassign the Pe-3 to reconnaissance divisions, relegating it to a rarity in subsequent ground attack missions.
