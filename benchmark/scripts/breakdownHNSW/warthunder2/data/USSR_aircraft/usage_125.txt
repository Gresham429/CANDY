Usage of Fw_190_D-9_(USSR): 
The Fw 190 D-9 is considered by many to be the best prop plane Germany has at 6.0 BR and below, and for good reason. The 190 D-9 is one of the few planes where its advantages are in extreme excess of its disadvantages. With its outstanding climb, high speed, crisp controls and tight firepower it is able to zoom in, get shots on target, and then escape in the blink of an eye. It may have mushy manoeuvring at low speeds, and may not be the best aircraft to take into the high vertical while slow, but it is by and large a top-tier aircraft in good hands.
