Description of Yak-38M: 
The Yak-38 had many problems, especially with the powerplant, which was complex, heavy, and underpowered, and suffered from inexcusable overheating issues, with some reports even stating that the Yak-38 was grounded during the hot summers of the Mediterranean sea due to the engine overheating dangerously during VTOL take-offs. By comparison to its adversaries such as the Harrier family, the initial Yak-38 was abysmally underperforming. These issues quickly led to a urgent request from the Soviet navy to upgrade the Yak-38 in the late '70s and early '80s to address these issues. This directly resulted in the upgraded Yak-38M, which entered service in 1985. The main upgrade in the Yak-38M variant, was the installation of a new set of engines, the Tumansky R-28V-300 and Rybinsk RD-38 engines respectively, to correct the issues with overheating and low power of the previous model, while also upgrading the aircraft's avionics and armament suite to include new all-aspect variants of the R-60, and better guidance and autopilot systems.
