Description of TIS_MA: 
Known originally as Polikarpov TIS, it was a heavy fighter developed during the 1940s competing with the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS and the Tairov Ta-3. The TIS MA was the name given to the second prototype, this one featured a heavily modified armament. Two ShVAK cannon replaced the nose ShKAS machine guns and a UBT machine gun in a VUB-1 mount replaced the dorsal ShKAS, while the ventral machine gun was removed entirely. Two 37 mm (1.5 in) Shpitalny Sh-37 or 45 mm (1.8 in) 111P cannon replaced the wing root guns. The originally planed engines were not available and the AM-38F had to be used instead. The aircraft was tested in 1944 with successful test results. However, two accidents, one brake failure and a crash destroyed all hopes on the TIS program, and later, Polikarpov design bureau was closed.
