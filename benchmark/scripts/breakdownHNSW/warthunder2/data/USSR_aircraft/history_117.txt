History of Su-6: 
The development of the Su-6 began in 1939 when the Sukhoi design bureau started working on a single-seat ground attack aircraft. Two prototypes were ordered on 4th March 1940, with the first of them having its maiden flight on 1st March 1941 with test pilot A.I. Kokin. The performance of the Su-6 was overall superior to the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft, unfortunately the Shvetsov M-71 radial engine powering the Su-6 exceeded its age limit before the testing was completed and there were no further M-71 engines available as the engines were never mass produced and only a few were made. The second Su-6 prototype flew only in January 1942 as the Sukhoi design bureau had to be evacuated after the German attack of the Soviet Union. A draft proposing production of 25 aircraft was prepared, but it was never issued.
