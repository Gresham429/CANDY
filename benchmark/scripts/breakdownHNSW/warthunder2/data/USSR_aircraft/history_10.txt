History of I-153_M-62: 
The I-153 Chaika (aka I-15ter) is the last biplane made by Polikarpov. Created in 1939, due to misleading results of Aerial Warfare in the 1937 Spanish Civil War, a meeting chaired by Stalin concluded that the Fiat CR.32 biplane was superior to the Polikarpov I-16 monoplane. A technologically superior Bf 109 that had been introduced was ignored, and instead, work on the new I-153 biplane was officially approved on 11 October 1937.
