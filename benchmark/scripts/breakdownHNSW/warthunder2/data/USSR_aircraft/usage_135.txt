Usage of MiG-15bis: 
In-game, the MiG-15bis fulfils the same role as the MiG-15, primarily serving as an air superiority fighter and bomber interceptor. Armament is substandard in comparison to other countries, relying on low velocity weapons that are highly inaccurate, and situated below the fuselage, aggravating targeting angles during dogfights. It excels in vertical combat manoeuvres, taking advantage of its high thrust-to-weight ratio. The MiG-15bis also has a limited ground attack capability.
