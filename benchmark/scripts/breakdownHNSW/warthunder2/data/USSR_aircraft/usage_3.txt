Usage of I-16_type_10: 
Like its predecessor the strength of Type 10 depends to some extent on its versatility, being able to outspeed most biplanes and outmanoeuvre most monoplanes it faces. However, because of the plane's higher BR in all game modes the Type 10 will face high-performance monoplanes like the Spitfire Mk I & II, the Bf 109 E/F, the C. 202, the P-400 and early Yaks and LaGGs in mixed battle matchmaking a lot more often than its predecessor. This can be quite problematic since the aircraft's overall performance isn't much better than the Type 5s and is actually inferior in some regards. The Type 10 however somewhat makes up for it due to the increase in firepower which allows it to take much better advantage of split-second firing opportunities since while its four light machine gun armament is generally not enough to kill in a quick burst it can at least hit and damage enemy aircraft a lot more efficiently than just two wing-mounted machine guns.
