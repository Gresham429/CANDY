Description of Su-6_(M-71F): 
The Su-6 was an aircraft developed with the intention of surpassing the combat-proven Il-2, however both projects were very similar. The Su-6 started development in 1939, with the first prototype flying in 1941. Problems with the engine and relocation due to World War 2 doomed the first two prototypes, although the second one had very successful test results. The third prototype learned from the lessons of the Il-2 in combat and introduced a rear gunner armed with a 12.7 mm HMG. It also addressed the engine problems introducing the new M-71F radial engine. The aircraft also featured a pair of 37 mm cannons in the wings, instead of the conventional 23 mm cannons.
