History of MiG-9_(l): 
During the 1930s, the turbojet engine was developed in both Germany and Great Britain and began the prototype jets of the day. In the early 1940s test aircraft now flew built by Gloster, Heinkel, Messerschmitt and Bell aircraft companies. At this point, the USSR was still ambivalent towards the turbojet engine and focused on other technologies. It wasn't until 1944 when all of the Soviet aircraft design teams were brought together and were tasked with producing a 'jet air force' with early designs coming from prominent companies at the time like Mikoyan-Gurevich, Yakovlev and Sukhoi. It wasn't until later in 1945 that pressure was put on both Mikoyan-Gurevich and Sukhoi do design and develop a single-seat jet fighter utilizing two captured German BMW 003 engines. These BMW engines are the same type which was utilised in the HE 162 and the Ar 234C. The Soviet military had seized the blueprints to the engines in Germany and had been in the process of building them to use with their new jet fighters.
