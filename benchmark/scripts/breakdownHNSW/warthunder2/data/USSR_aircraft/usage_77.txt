Usage of La-7: 
The key to staying alive in the La-7 series lies in using evasion and deception to destroy the enemy. Start by flying at around 4.5 km altitude as you present yourself as an easy target for Boom & Zoom aircraft that are flying at higher altitudes. Maintain a high energy level/speed (conserve your energy as well). When you spot someone diving at you, break off and evade his burst, and then chase him and return your own bursts, or, if he turns, engage in turning combat. Watch your opponent, however. Spitfire (Griffons) can, for the most part, out-turn a La-7 while other planes such as the Fw 190 D are far inferior at turning. It is possible to force overshoots on Spitfires by going into scissors. Acceleration on this plane is excellent at low-medium altitude (below 3 km where WEP still works). Additionally, the La-7 can be an effective mid-alt Boom and Zoom / energy fighter - when most opponents have been destroyed and the rest are engaging below you, the La-7, with its effective climb rate as well as acceleration/energy retention, can be unstoppable.
