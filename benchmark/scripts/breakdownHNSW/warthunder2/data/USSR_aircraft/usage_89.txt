Usage of Pokryshkin%27s_P-39N-0_(USSR): 
The Russian P-39N works basically like the American version, the only difference being lower mass due to removed machine guns and slightly improved roll and turn rate as a result. In Realistic battles it can take advantage of excellent low altitude performance, most low tier battles in which it will participate will take place there. Climbing in this plane is not an issue, it can get to 5,000 m in slightly over 4 minutes, so after reaching it will most likely encounter other fighters like the Bf 109 E/F, or the American counterparts at similar altitude.
