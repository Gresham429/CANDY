Usage of Hurricane_Mk_IIB_(USSR): 
Although a highly successful and popular fighter, by 1940 the Hurricane Mk I was already showing itself to be inferior to enemy fighters such as the Messerschmitt 109. Experience from the Battle of Britain had also proved that the Hurricane's rifle-calibre 0.303 machine guns were inferior to larger calibre weapons being operated by enemy aircraft.
