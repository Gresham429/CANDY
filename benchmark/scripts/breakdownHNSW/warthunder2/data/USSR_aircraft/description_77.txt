Description of La-7: 
The Lavochkin La-7 was developed as an improved version of the successful La-5 fighter. It featured a new metal airframe and improved much improved flight performance. Despite initial issues with armament and engine reliability, it proved to be faster and more manoeuvrable than its predecessor. It excelled in engagements against German aircraft such as the Bf 109 and Fw 190. The La-7 was a popular choice among Soviet pilots during World War II, with Soviet ace Ivan Kozhedub achieving notable success while flying it. Post-war, it was eventually replaced by the La-9 prop fighter. It was to be originally armed with three 20mm cannons, but problems in the procurement of said weaponry forced the aircraft to retain the same 2 x 20 mm ShVAK cannons as the La-5.
