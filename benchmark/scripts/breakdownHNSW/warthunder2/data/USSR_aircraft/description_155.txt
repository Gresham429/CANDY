Description of Yak-28B: 
The Yak-28B(NATO Codename: Brewer-A) was perhaps the last combat jet developed by YakovlevÂ that joined the VVS, was also the first supersonic frontline bomber of VVS. The design of Yak-28 was based on the Yak-26 (Yak-123) where VSS called for a new supersonic bomber with better payload and speed; these jets were produced from 1960 to 1971 in Irkutsk; although designated as a supersonic frontline bomber, one of its variant which was an interceptor (Yak-28P, codename Firebar) were the most produced variant of Yak-28 family. The Yak-28B was the tactical bomber variant with Lotos radar and was produced as one of the earliest mass-produced variants of the family.
