Usage of ITP_(M-1): 
The ITP (M-1) is capable of fulfilling different roles on the battlefield: thanks to its nose-mounted armament, it can perform aircraft interception while also having the potential for ground attack. In aerial combat, the ITP shines at quickly disposing of enemy aircraft, relying on Boom & Run tactics in engagements. Its 37 mm cannon is what makes it so deadly: any shots landed onto any enemy plane will, most of the time, cripple it, if not outright destroy it.
