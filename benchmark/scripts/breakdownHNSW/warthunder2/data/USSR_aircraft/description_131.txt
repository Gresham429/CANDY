Description of Yak-23: 
The Yak-23 was developed as a further upgrade to the Yak-15 and Yak-17 designs. It was one of the first Soviet single-seat jet engine fighters. Like its predecessors, it used the existing fuselage and airframe of the Yak-3 piston fighter and adapted an engine to it, specifically the Klimov RD500 turbojet engine. The Yak-23 saw limited success compared to more famous MiG-9, but it was still produced in decent numbers. With a total of 319 units built (prototypes included), it also served in the air forces of different nations allied with the USSR like Poland, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, North Korea, and Czechoslovakia.
