History of LaGG-3-8: 
The LaGG-3 was designed by Soviet engineers Lavochkin, Gorbunov, and Gudkov to replace the LaGG-1. The original LaGG-3 prototype was made almost entirely out of wood. The airframe was made out of special multi-ply wood bonded with resin. The wings were similar to that of the Yak-1, the difference being the LaGG wing was made in two sections. The fuselage was similar to another Soviet fighter, the MiG-3. Armament includes a 20 mm ShVAK rapid-fire cannon with 150 RPG mounted in a hollow shaft. A 12.7 mm Berezin machine gun was synchronized and mounted on the engine cowling with 170 RPG. The LaGG-3 had many problems during production, the Klimov M-106 engine was powerful but unreliable. The Klimov M105, however, was more reliable but weaker. This led to the LaGG-3 being severely underpowered and disliked by many pilots. This led to Lavochkin's decision to install a more powerful Shvetsov M-82 radial. Which gave birth to one of the most feared fighters in the game: the La-5.
