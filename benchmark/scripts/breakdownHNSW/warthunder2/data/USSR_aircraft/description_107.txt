Description of La-9: 
The La-9 was a single-seat all-metal fighter aircraft developed by the Lavochkin Design Bureau in the late 1940s. It was a departure from previous wooden construction designs like the La-7, featuring an all-metal construction for increased performance and durability. The aircraft had added a pressurized cockpit to address heat issues for the pilot. It was powered by a Shvetsov ASh-82FN engine and armed with 4 x NS23 23mm cannons. A total of 1,882 La-9 planes were produced until 1949 and saw service with the Soviet Air Force, People's Liberation Army Air Force of China, and the Korean People's Army Air Force. It was eventually phased out as jet technology became prevalent in the early 1950s.
