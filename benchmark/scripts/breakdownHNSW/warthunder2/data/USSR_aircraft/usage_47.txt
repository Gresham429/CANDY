Usage of La-5: 
At the start of the game, climb high and wait for the first dogfight to commence. Once the other planes are engaged, dive on one, fire a good burst, and pull away back to around 3,000 m, and do it again. Shallow dives like this typically best take place at a lower altitude than other boom and zoom aircraft, but here is where the plane's speed will be optimal for manoeuvrability. If you pick up a tail, speeds of around 300 km/h (186 mph) are the best for manoeuvring. This plane is one of the first Soviet fighters in the game to have a powerful engine, WEP, and effective cooling.
