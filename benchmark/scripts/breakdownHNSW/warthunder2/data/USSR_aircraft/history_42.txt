History of I-16_type_27: 
During the Spanish Civil War, the I-16 Type 27 saw extensive service with the Republican forces. Soviet pilots and aircraft mechanics arrived in Spain in October 1936, and by the end of the year, a group of Soviet volunteers was formed, which became known as the "Chapaev Squadron." The I-16 Type 27 was used by this squadron and was instrumental in several key engagements during the conflict, including the Battle of Jarama and the Battle of Brunete.
