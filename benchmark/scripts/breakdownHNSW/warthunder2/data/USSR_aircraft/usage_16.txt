Usage of Pe-3_(e): 
The Pe-3 (e) can be used for a variety of roles, depending on what you are comfortable with. In Air RB, the aircraft can be used as a high-speed base bomber, or bomber interceptor. For base bombing, you can choose the heaviest payload (2 x 250 kg and 2 x 100 kg), and, once spawned in, go into a shallow dive towards the base you are going for. Once over the base, drop your payload and break away. Remember to set your bomb fuse to at least 2 seconds, or else you will blow yourself to bits. However, the Pe-3 (e) can also be used as a bomber interceptor, although this may be harder. While the Berezins and the ShKAS both have a high rate of fire, there is limited ammo, and you might not be able to down the bomber before your ammo runs out. Instead, rockets could be a much better choice. You can load 6 x RS-132 rockets, or 6 x RBS-132s. For bomber-hunting, the RS-132 will be better-suited, as it has more explosive filler (4.9 kg vs 1.5 kg). While it is harder to hit moving targets in the air with rockets, with practice, you will be able to down any bomber in your sights. Setting a rocket activation fuse can also help (recommended at leat 500m), as it will guarantee the detonation of the rocket even with a near miss, improving your chances of hitting your target.
