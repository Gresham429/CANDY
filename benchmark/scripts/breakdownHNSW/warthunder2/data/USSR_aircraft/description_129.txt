Description of Yak-15: 
The Yak-15 was one of the first attempts by the Soviet Union to produce a jet-engined fighter. Development started at the end of WWII, and to reduce development time, it was decided to use the existing airframe of the Yak-3 piston fighter and adapt a reverse-engineered German Junkers Jumo 004 engine. It was developed alongside the MiG-9 and it's still disputed to this day which of the two was the true first jet fighter of the USSR. Compared to its aforementioned competitor, the Yak-15 was easier to fly thanks to being designed on the basis of the Yak-3, many pilots already knowing how to fly the plane. A total of 280 units were built until 1947, and it was specially used to adapt old piston fighter pilots to fly jet-engined fighters.
