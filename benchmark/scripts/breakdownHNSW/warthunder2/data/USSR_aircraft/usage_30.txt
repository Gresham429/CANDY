Usage of Hampden_TB_Mk_I_(USSR): 
This bomber is strictly that; a bomber. With a mediocre defensive armament and only a single offensive 7.7, engaging enemy aircraft is an absolute last resort. The lack of defensive capabilities, combined with the thin tail and wings, make the Hampden TB a fragile aircraft. Upon spawning, climb at a very shallow angle to increase your speed and altitude at the same time. When the bomb points are in range, level off and drop your load. This will make you significantly lighter and allow you to return to base extremely quickly. During this time, one must take care to avoid aircraft that will now be at your altitude. A shallow dive will allow a boost in speed, and a corkscrew over the airfield will let you drop the remaining altitude without ripping due to speed.
