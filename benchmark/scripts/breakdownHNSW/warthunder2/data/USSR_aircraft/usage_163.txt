Usage of MiG-21bis: 
The main things to remember about this plane is that it is fairly manoeuvrable at high speeds and it accelerates quickly and climbs pretty well. In a combat situation, you should avoid flying slower than 800 km/h, as your plane loses a significant amount of thrust and manoeuvrability at speeds lower than that.
