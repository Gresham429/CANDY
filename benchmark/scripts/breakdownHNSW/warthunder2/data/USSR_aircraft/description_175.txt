Description of Yak-141: 
The Yak-141 (also known as the "Yak-41", NATO reporting name "Freestyle") was a prototype Soviet VTOL fighter designed as a successor to the Yak-38. While the subsonic "Forger" with limited payload and poor handling was more of a proof of concept than a serious combat aircraft for its time, the heavily evolved Yak-141 was a far more capable one. It was a much larger aircraft with refined aerodynamics and a monstrously powerful Tumansky R-79 turbofan primary engine. With modern avionics and long-range missiles at its disposal, the Yak-141 was poised to be a world-leading supersonic VTOL fighter and a strong asset for the Soviet Navy â€” however, the collapse of the USSR prevented the Yak from entering serial production and operational service in real life.
