Usage of Pe-8: 
The Pe-8, as mentioned earlier, is in essence a Soviet Death Star (a.k.a Tu-4 at a lower tier). It both boasts a very effective cannon armament and a high bomb load, able to destroy two bases in one pass. Its 5,000 kg bomb is especially useful in Ground Battles as a "tactical nuke" of sorts, able to wipe out large concentrations of enemy tanks.
