Description of Fw_190_D-9_(USSR): 
The Focke-Wulf 190 "Dora" variant was designed to be a high-altitude fighter that could intercept bomber formations. However, that would never happen on a widespread scale, and 190 D-9s were relegated to attacking enemy fighters or ground attacks. The 190 D-9 was one of the most widely produced Fw variants, with over 1,800 built. With this many built, it was bound to end up in another country's hands, which happened with the Soviets. Although none would ever face combat against the Luftwaffe, the Soviets conducted several performance tests and mock dogfights against the La-7. Various pilots flew each plane and every time the La-7 came out on top, but this comes with the caveat that the 190 D-9 was not tested with methanol-water injection (MW50).
