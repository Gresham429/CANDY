Description of Tu-4: 
Towards the end of WWII, the United States refused the request of the USSR to recieve B-29s under the Lend-lease program multiple times. Lacking the technology to create a proper strategic long range bomber to replace their aging (and limited) fleet of Pe-8 bombers, the USSR started looking for other solutions to modernize their bomber fleet. Their solution fell to them from the sky... multiple times, as three different B-29s would divert or crash land in the far Eastern USSR, and due to the USSR's neutrality in the Pacific War against Japan at that point, these bombers were kept despite demands from the US to return them. Stalin quickly ordered the reverse engineering of the three bombers into a new Soviet heavy bomber, and assigned the daunting task to Andrei Tupolev. The first aircraft was disassembled down to each screw to be studied, the second was repaired for flight testing, and the third, being the most minimally damaged, was left as a standard reference for the designers. In total, 900 factories and research institutes were involved in the project. The most significant change was in the engine department and armament, with the Tu-4 being powered by Soviet-built copies of the Wright R-3350 engines used in the B-29 and the .50 cal turrets replaced with NS-23 cannon turrets. After four years of hard work, alot of bureaucratic hurdles, and technological rushes, the first Tu-4 would take to the skies on May 19, 1947, with serial production being authorized to start immediately.
