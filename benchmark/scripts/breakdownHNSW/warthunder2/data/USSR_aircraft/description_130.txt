Description of Yak-17: 
The Yak-17 was a further development of the Yak-15 jet fighter developed by the Soviet Union. The Yak-17 was also the basis for the Yak-23 and it functioned as the main training fighter for pilots transitioning from piston-engine fighters to jet engines. The Yak-17 was very similar to the Yak-15, it retained the airframe of the Yak-3 and only addressed a few issues to make the fighter more viable. It introduced a bulletproof glass pane in the front of the cockpit as well as extra fuel tanks for longer range. The biggest improvement was the introduction of a modern landing gear like the one present in the MiG-9. Only 430 units were made and most of them were eventually given to the Czech and Polish air forces.
