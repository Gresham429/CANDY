Usage of Su-25: 
The Su-25 is best suited for low altitude attack runs on enemy ground units. Its multitude of air-to-ground weapons as well as its good survivability allow it to perform CAS role in Ground Realistic Battles very well. However, like the A-10, it needs some finesse in its operation, as it is outperformed by contemporary fighters and can be sent back to the hangar by a good SAM operator if the pilot is not careful. If there are no significant threats around, the Su-25 can fly at medium altitudes, look for targets, and lob HE rockets at them with ease. Otherwise, it is best to maintain a low profile and circle around the battlefield at lower altitudes to better avoid detection from SAMs and enemy fighters. A pair of R-60Ms can effectively dispatch enemy aircraft in sneak attacks, but evicting enemy SAM operators is a more difficult question. The simplest option is to determine where they are located, which in most cases will be the enemy spawn, and figure out an approach that will allow for a sneak attack; a single S-25O landing in the neighbourhood of a SPAA vehicle will usually knock it out of commission. If reliable teammates are available, the laser-guided missiles have some utility. Active scouting and drone target designation will allow the Su-25 to see the location of enemy SAMs and begin a high-altitude missile joust with a Kh-25 or Kh-29 at safer distances, and if the S-25O's 58 kg of TNT was impressive, the Karen/Kedge's 100+ kg of TNT are nothing short of spectacular. Make good use of the Su-25's massive countermeasure capacity, as these are high-calibre countermeasures with strong effects. It should be difficult for enemies to obtain radar or IR locks on the Frogfoot.
