Description of I-301: 
The I-301 was the prototype for the LaGG-3 fighter series, and so construction, and flight characteristics and performance are similar to them. Unlike many fighters, the I-301 was made out of wood and polymer, which contributed to its flying capabilities. Contrary to popular belief, the wooden construction was quite resistant to catching fire. A successful prototype made its maiden flight in March, 1940. The aircraft was powered by a 12-cylinder liquid-cooled Klimov M-105P radial engine with a rated output of 1,050 HP and its armament was, at the beginning, insanely powerful for its time. It used a 23 mm PTB-23 cannon with 81 rounds of ammunition. The aircraft suffered from poor operational range and thus, two extra fuel tanks were added in the wings.
