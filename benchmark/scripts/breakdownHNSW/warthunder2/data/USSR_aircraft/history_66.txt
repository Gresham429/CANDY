History of IL-2_M-82: 
In early July of 1941, due to the rapid advance of German troops into central Russia, there was a threat of a reduction in the supply of IL-2 AM-38 aircraft engines. Anticipating possible issues, Sergey Ilyushin suggested adapting the Sturmovik engine to the more common M-82 engine to the Soviet military aviation authorities. In a very short time, the aircraft engineers in the Ilyushin design bureau built a prototype attacker aircraft for testing with the new engine. The prototype also featured a much anticipated defensive turret with a position for an air gunner, the need for which became evident after the first IL-2 sorties in WWII. Unlike the production version, the IL-2 with the M-82 engine did not have engine compartment protection - the armored capsule was shortened and ended with an armored plate between the pilot and the engine. The new engine also required the installation of an updated propeller. The gunner's seat was positioned to the rear of the cockpit, where a blister turret with a 12.7mm UBT machine gun with armored glass was located. Tests of the new version of the attack aircraft demonstrated that such a design does not have critical problems despite its inferior speed to the regular IL-2. By the spring of 1942, a prototype with the M-82IR engine appeared, which was better suited for low altitudes, from which the attack aircraft was operating most of the time. Flight characteristics have been improved, but by that time the production of native AM-38 engines was normal and there was no need to modify the IL-2 with M-82 engines any more.
