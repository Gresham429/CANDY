History of DB-3B: 
After Sergei Ilyushin's BB-2 failed to compete with Tupolev's SB bomber in 1934, Ilyushin converted the BB-2 into a long-range bomber to compete again against Tupolev's DB-2 in order to recover the resources, energy, and time he had invested in the BB-2. He redesigned the BB-2, using a high-performance engine licensed by the Soviet Union in 1934, to exceed military standards.
