Usage of IL-2M_%22Avenger%22: 
Tactically, as with all IL aircraft, the Avenger is best suited to ground-pounding at low altitude. Avoiding conflict with aircraft is a priority, as, though tanky, the plane will not withstand much-concentrated fire, especially to its wings. When engaging ground targets, approach at a slight climb before nosing down to begin a shallow dive towards them. Bombing in this way will nearly always allow you to get away from the blast wave, and the 1.5-second delay is more than enough for you to gain enough distance, even from the 250 kg bombs. If using both bombs and rockets, lightening the aircraft from the bombs will allow you to more effectively manoeuvre to use rockets before returning to base. Use bombs against tanks and pillboxes, rockets against groups of light armoured vehicles (and occasionally enemy aircraft), and use your machine guns and cannons for AAA, artillery, armoured cars, and enemy aircraft.
