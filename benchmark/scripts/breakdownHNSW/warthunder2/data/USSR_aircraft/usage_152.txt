Usage of Su-7B: 
The Su-7B has a very good acceleration and can outspeed most jets, it can easily dodge incoming missiles by turning as it can turn and still maintain most of its speed (mind the G forces as it can easily break your plane apart and make the pilot lose consciousness). The Su-7B sports 30 mm NR-30 cannons and can also be equipped with both bombs and rockets for various types of playstyle. The Su-7B also comes with a rangefinding radar and the S-24 can be put on a distance fuse to be used in air combat.
