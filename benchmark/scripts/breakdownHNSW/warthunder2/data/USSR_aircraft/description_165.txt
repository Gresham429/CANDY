Description of MiG-23MLD: 
In the dawn of the 1980s, the refinements to the MiG-23 airframe in the MiG-23ML and MLA variants were deemed "still insufficient" and too difficult to use in combat against the latest 4th generation aircraft (as demonstrated in combat in the Middle East and Africa). As a result, until the (then) early MiG-29 could have its early production issues ironed out, an "ultimate" refinement of the MiG-23 was ordered, based on the upgrades applied to the ML and MLA variants previously and incorporating new technology from the then new MiG-29. The new plane had a complete overhaul to not only its avionics, but the airframe as well. The airframe was lightened even further over the ML "lightweight" variant, the wings were upgraded to the new strengthened "Type 4" wing with the "dogtooth" wing root for increased AoA at higher speeds, and were also given new slats and vortex generators to increase low speed performance. And to top off the flight performance upgrades, the powerful R-35F-300 engine providing extra thrust over older MiG-23 models was installed. The radar was replaced with the brand new N-008 (Sapphire-23MLA-II) radar, featuring electronic countermeasure resistance, vertical scan "dogfight" modes, Track-While-Scan capability, and far greater range over previous Sapphire-23 models. The avionics suite was completely overhauled with new smaller and lighter electronics, including new GCI and autopilot systems, multiple new new safety systems, and most importantly, the major upgrade from the previous SPO-10 RWR to the new SPO-15L "Breyoza" RWR system from the MiG-29. The reinforcement and lightening of the airframe resulted in the MiG-23MLD, when in the hands of experienced pilots in Maryi airbase (the Soviet equivalant to the American "Top Gun" aggressor training school) being able to beat even the new MiG-29 regularly in hit-and-run dogfights. Almost all MLDs were rebuilt from older ML and MLA aircraft, with the exception being the 62 export MLDs sold to Bulgaria (12) and Syria (50), being the last brand new single-seat MiG-23 airframes to roll off the production line.
