Usage of Yak-28B: 
The Yak-28B has 2 very powerful engines that give it a immense acceleration. Even at extreme high altitudes the jet bomber is capable of retaining a very high speed above Mach 1, where others will start to lose speed. It has a poor turn rate, but it is paired with a high thrust ratio: allowing you to retain your speed when turning. Your best chances at surviving is to stay high at all times and keep going above Mach 1 (your bombs still drop beyond Mach 1). You are untouchable when going high altitude paired with sound breaking speed, even able to outfly some early air-to-air missiles. Your only weakness being when landing and taking off, being able to get intercepted by enemy jets. It comes with CCIP that gives you the gimmick to allow to bomb from third perspective accurately. Lastly it also has countermeasures that can help you to defend yourself from missiles if they were to get too close to you.
