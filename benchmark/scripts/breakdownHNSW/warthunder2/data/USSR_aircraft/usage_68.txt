Usage of I-180S: 
You can climb to about 4,000-5,000 m of altitude at the beginning of the battle and use Boom & Zoom tactic to get rid of some low-altitude enemies first. If there are any enemies above or at the same altitude as you, it is recommended to attempt to drag them into a dogfight. Head-on attacks are ill-advised against heavily armed and armoured planes such as the F4U Corsair, P-40 Warhawk, and Fw 190 because the I-180S lacks armour around many critical components, including the pilot and fuel tank. The I-180S's armament seems to push the nose up a small amount, but good aim prevents this from being that much of an issue.
