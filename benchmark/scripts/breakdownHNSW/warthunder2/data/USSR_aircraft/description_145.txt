Description of BI: 
On July 12, 1940, Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov attended a special commissar meeting calling for the development of a high-speed stratospheric aircraft with his top two engineers, Aleksander Bereznyak and Aleksei Isayev. Barely over a year later, on 1 September 1941, the Bereznyak-Isayev (BI) 1 was completed and ready for gliding tests, as the planned engine was still not ready. By the next year, the full aircraft was ready for its primary tests, and on 15 May 1942, test pilot Grigory Yakovlevich Bakhchivandzhi piloted the BI-1 during its first powered flight. Due to the highly toxic and corrosive fuel mixture used by the BI, utilizing a mix of tractor kerosene and red-fuming nitric acid, the BI-1 became too corroded by acid to fly safely shortly after, and was retired. The second prototype (BI-2) was built and Backchivadzhi made the second flight on 10 Jan 1943. The BI program would progress steadily over the next few years, showing great promise for a point defence/short range interceptor. However, the dangers of the program, mainly the lack of reusability and feasibility due to the short lifespan of the airframes and their very expensive and dangerous fuel mixture, resulted in a growing sentiment against the BI from the higher ups. Unfortunately, on 27 March, during a low-altitude test flight, the BI piloted by Bakhchivandzhi entered a 45-degree dive and crashed into the ground, killing Bakhchivandzhi. Whilst unknown at the time, the conventional wing design resulted in severe control "compression" when nearing transsonic speeds. By late 1944, it was very obvious at the BI program had reached a stalemate, and any further development was overshadowed by the advent of turbojet aircraft, performing the same role for a fraction of the price, preparation, and risk. However, it is not to say that the BI program was fruitless, as the knowledge obtained by Bolkhovitinov design bureau about rocket science became pivotal in future Soviet rocket and missile developments.
