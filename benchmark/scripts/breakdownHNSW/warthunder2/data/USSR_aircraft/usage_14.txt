Usage of Su-2_TSS-1: 
The Su-2 TSS-1 is an interesting aircraft compared to its brethren. On one hand, you now have improved speed and agility (not to Chaika levels though, so don't go dogfighting). On the other hand, however, you now have half the machine gun firepower when strafing enemy aircraft or ground units. Additionnally, you still retain the exact same payload as other Su-2 series aircraft, so ground-pounding ordnance isn't affected. Whether or not such a gain and loss of attributes compared to the previous MV-5 model is worth it is up to you.
