Usage of IL-2M_(1943): 
The IL-2M (1943) is mainly limited to attacking ground targets. The 23 mm VYa-23 cannons can easily attack light and medium tanks as well as light pillboxes. However, light pillboxes take a significant amount of ammunition and the IL-2M only has 300 rounds of 23 mm ammunition. The cannons can easily penetrate the engine decks of many tanks at its battle rating so in ground battles the IL-2M (1943) is very potent. However, the 7.62 mm machine guns are ineffective against many ground targets although they can attack and destroy soft ground targets like anti-air positions or open-top vehicles. The bombs and rockets should be used against relatively stronger targets like light pillboxes or heavy tanks.
