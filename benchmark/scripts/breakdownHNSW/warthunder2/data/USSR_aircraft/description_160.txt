Description of MiG-21S_(R-13-300): 
During the mid 1960s, While the Soviet Air Defence Force (PVO) was content with their MiG-21 variants, the Soviet Air Force (VVS) set out to acquire a better fighter-interceptor, as their current MiG-21PF were mainly suited for heavy interception and light ground attack, with little emphasis on air-to-air combat. Research from Mikoyan OKB quickly resulted in the Ye-7S prototype, a MiG-21PF with the new Sapfir-21 radar, allowing it to mount not only the ASP-PF-21 radar-computing gunsight, but also R-3R (K-13R) semi-active radar guided (SARH) air to air missile, increasing the lethality of this aircraft during interception and especially during head-on and side-on engagements with enemy aircraft. The design was greatly favoured by the VVS, and after a small request to also increase the fuel capacity, the MiG-21S was born. The MiG-21S had the extra fuel incorporated in the larger saddle tank taken from the MiG-21R variant, while mounting all the avionics upgrades of the Ye-7S prototype. This aircraft would begin delivery to its only operator, the Soviet Air Force (VVS) in 1965, and would see active combat shortly after, most notably participating in the Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
