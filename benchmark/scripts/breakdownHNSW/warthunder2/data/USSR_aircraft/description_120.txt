Description of La-11: 
The La-11 was a late propeller fighter developed as an improved version of the La-9. Initially named as La-130, the aircraft was further enhanced based on VVS recommendations and renamed as La-9M. With increased fuel capacity and weight, it was later certified as the La-11 in 1947. However, by 1951, with the rise of jet fighters, the La-11 became obsolete. It had limited combat success and was primarily used as a trainer. The aircraft found second life with Soviet allies like the KPAF and PLAAF before being phased out in favour of jet fighters.
