Usage of A-20G-30_(USSR): 
The A-20G-30 was a modification of the American A-20G-25, thus it excels at attacking soft targets such as howitzers and SPAA. The 6 x .50 calibre guns situated in the nose are fully capable of destroying light pillboxes en masse. While still capable of hitting bases with its 2 x 1,000 kg bombs, this aircraft is more effective with loads that contain larger numbers of bombs for soft targets.
