History of MiG-23M: 
The MiG-21 was the main Soviet fighter jet from the 1960's onward. However, the jet left much to be desired. The nose cone radar was too small and weak to be useful for BVR engagements, and the range of the MiG-21 was notoriously small. Compared to the American F-4 Phantom, the MiG-21 was far behind in avionics and missile armament. To address these shortfalls, a new Soviet fighter jet was conceived. The MiG 21 had a short take off run, which the Soviets were pleased by as it gave the MiG-21 the ability to use improvised runways in a potential Cold War gone hot situation, so the successor to the MiG-21 would also have to have a short takeoff run. One prototype of the MiG-23 was the Ye-8, which resembled a larger MiG-21 with canards, an underbelly air intake and a large radome. Another was the 23-01 or Izdeliye 92, which resembled a larger MiG-21 with side-mounted air intakes, a large radome, and most notably, liftjets to shorten its takeoff run. In the end, a variable sweep wing system was chosen to give the MiG-23 a short takeoff run.
