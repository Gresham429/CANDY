History of La-174: 
As a prototype of the La-15, the La-174 saw no combat experience. Only one was ever built, and it crashed during flight testing. Compared to the production version of the La-15, it was powered by a British Rolls-Royce engine, rather than the Soviet-made Klimov RD-500k which was derived from the aforementioned British turbojet engine.
