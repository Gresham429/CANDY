Usage of I-16_type_5: 
The I-16 Type 5's biggest asset is its versatility. This aircraft is considerably faster than most biplanes which allows it to use superior speed (both in level flight and in dives) and energy to engage them safely, while at the same time it can outmanoeuvre a lot of its faster opponents if not by turn rate at least by using its breakneck roll rate. It also has a significantly fast climb-rate of over 14 m/s to up to 3,000 m which is only beaten at its battle rating by Bf 109 E-1/F-1s, Spitfire Mk Is and by the Ki-27/43/44. As previously mentioned the plane has a phenomenal roll rate of up to 150Â°/s. On the other hand, the roll rate can under some circumstances cause the plane to lose control, particularly while performing high G pull ups after recovering on a dive which in some circumstances may prove fatal.
