Description of MiG-15bis_ISH: 
In 1953-1954, there was multiple programs involving modifying the MiG-15bis into various other roles and specialities. One such variant was the MiG-15bis-ISH, a dedicated "Shturmovik", or ground attacker. For the ground attack modification, the MiG-15bis was given long wing-fence pylons on each wing, coupled with new experimental rocket launch rails that were angled downwards, allowing the MiG-15bis-ISH to carry a large quantity of bombs (for a MiG-15) or a lot of downwards angled rockets for ground attack runs.
