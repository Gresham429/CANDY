Description of Yak-1B: 
The Yakovlev Yak-1B is the second variant of the Yak-1 fighter aircraft family. The Yak-1B debuted in the autumn of 1942 with a more powerful Klimov M-105P engine with improved low-altitude performance and a single 12.7 mm Berezin UB heavy machine gun instead of two 7.62 mm ShKAS light machine guns. Although this did not significantly enhance the total weight, it did result in a substantial increase in firepower. Other changes were electrical and pneumatic weapon firing instead of the mechanical system, a new control stick based on the Messerschmitt Bf 109's design, a new gunsight, an airtight fuselage, a retractable tailwheel, and enhanced engine cooling. "Yak-1B" was an unofficial designation; all Yak-1s were produced to this specification after October 1942. The first flight (aircraft No. 3560) occurred in June 1942, and manufacture of the Yak-1B began in August. There were 4,188 aircraft manufactured in total.
