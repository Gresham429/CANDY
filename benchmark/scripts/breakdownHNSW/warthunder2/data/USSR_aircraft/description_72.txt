Description of Yak-3: 
The Yakovlev Yak-3 was the first variant of the Yak-3 fighter aircraft family. The Yak 3 was one of several significant Soviet aircraft developed by Aleksandr Sergeyevich Yakovlev's Design Bureau, with development beginning in 1941 and initially centred on the new VK-107 VEE-twelve engine, with design parameters including the least possible drag, smallest dimensions, and weight consistent with a manoeuvrable and tough fighting aircraft. The design began with the I-30 prototype, presented alongside the I-26 (Yak-1) as an alternate design. The I-30 was an all-metal aircraft powered by a Klimov M-105P engine and featured a wing with dihedral on the outer panels. While the I-26 continued into production as the Yak-1, it was realised during the Battle of Stalingrad that the design was greatly in need of modernisation. Thus, Yakovlev returned to the I-30 prototype, incorporating new design elements inspired by the Yak-1, eventually producing the Yak-3. The Yak-3 did not reach actual duty until July 1944, but it quickly proved to be a superb handling aircraft at heights of up to 4,000 m, astonishing its pilots with its ability. Since the VK-107 VEE-twelve engine was unavailable, the Yak 1's VK-105 engine was used instead. A total of 4,848 aircraft were produced, gaining significant success against German fighters in the latter stages of World War II and, when eventually upgraded with the 1,700 hp VK-107A engine in late 1944 (Yak-3 (VK-107)), achieved a speed of 720 km/h at 6,000 m. The fastest Yak-3 variant, powered by the VK-108 engine, initially flew on December 9, 1944, reaching 745 km/h.
