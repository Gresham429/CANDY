Usage of Zhukovsky%27s_I-153-M62: 
As described earlier, climbing at an aggressive rate during the beginning of the game is extremely beneficial. Once at bomber altitude, building up speed is a must as the biplane bleeds speed in high altitude turns. However, once this is achieved, the plane has free reign overruling the sky. Play mainly as an interceptor and air-defence fighter and watch as the enemy plummets towards the ground.
