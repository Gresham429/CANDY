History of IL-8_(1944): 
At the height of WWII, Ilyushinâ€™s design team was tasked with improving the IL-2 attack aircraft by creating two new versions. The first with improved performance characteristics and a reduced payload, and the second with enhanced armor and increasing the payload to 1000 kg. The engine for both versions was to be the new AM-42, and in addition to this numerous improvements to flight and operational characteristics were implemented. The test program for the first prototype of an attack aircraft with enhanced armor, designated the IL-8 AM-42, ended in March 1944. Despite successful test results, this aircraft did not go into production.
