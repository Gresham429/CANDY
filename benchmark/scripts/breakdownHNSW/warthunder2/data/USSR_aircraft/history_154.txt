History of Su-25: 
After realizing that current supersonic attacks with planes like the Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21, and MiG-23 were not capable of precisely attacking ground forces at high speeds. The Soviet Ministry of Defense started developing a new dedicated attack aircraft meant to operate close to the ground forces and stay alive. The development contract was given to the designer Sukhoi, with the aircraft making its first flight in 1972 and entering production in 1978.
