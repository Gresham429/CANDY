History of MiG-19PT: 
After taking its first flight in 1954, the MiG-19 became a worldwide sensation â€“ it was the first mass-produced aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier in horizontal flight after taking off from the ground. Although it was the most advanced combat aircraft of its day, the MiG-19 also had certain problems with manoeuvrability, and certain other improvements also took shape that were then used in the upgraded versions of the MiG-19. The fighter received an all-movable stabilizer that significantly improved its flight characteristics, enhanced control and braking systems, and new, more powerful 30 mm guns instead of 23 mm guns. One of the most interesting modifications was the MiG-19PT fighter-interceptor, which was developed especially for the installation of K-13 (P-3C) air-to-air missiles. This missile was strongly influenced by the extremely successful American Sidewinder, models of which the Soviet Union received from China. The MiG-19PT's flight tests were successfully completed in 1964. The K-13 missile was then used on an entire series of combat aircraft and remained in active use until the end of the 80s. The MiG-19 itself was modernized several times and participated in many armed conflicts. Over 2,000 MiG-19s were manufactured in the USSR, and even more MiGs were manufactured in China: over 4,500 units.
