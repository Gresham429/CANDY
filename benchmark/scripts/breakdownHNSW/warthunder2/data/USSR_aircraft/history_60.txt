History of Hurricane_Mk_IIB_(USSR): 
Right after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain offered immediate assistance and send a wing with two Hurricane equipped squadrons to Murmansk in September. The Brits were happily welcomed near the front-line by their Soviet Hosts. Flt Lt. Jack Ross, who recently gained ace status, wrote in his memoirs: "The whole wing passed out completely after drinking vodka. I was so bad I completely missed the concert given in our honour."[1] During the deployment, No. 151 Wing got quite some action, before defensive patrols and training duty became predominant. Many Soviet pilots were trained by the Brits, before the Hurricanes were handed over to the Soviets on 18 October. The Wing has scored 15 kills for the loss of one aircraft.
