History of Yak-30D: 
The Soviet Yak-30 was an experimental fighter/interceptor developed from the failed Yak-25 with a swept wing design similar to that found in early cold war fighter jets like the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre. The design in fact was largely similar to the Yak-25 and the most important change was the addition of the swept wing at 35Â°. The development of the Yak-25 ended in 1948, the same year the Yak-30 took to the skies.
