Description of TB-3M-17-32: 
In 1925, the rapidly modernizing and growing Red Army Air Force reached out to TsAGI (Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute) in Moscow to create a new "TB", or Тяжёлый Бомбардировщик (Heavy Bomber) to replace the aging TB-1. Building on the existing civilian ANT-6 aircraft, a complete revision of the airframe led to the world's very first cantilever winged four engine heavy bomber. The TB-3M would be produced in many variants, ranging from standard bombers, to transport and paratrooper carriers, to even ideas as wild as specially modified arctic pole explorers and flying aircraft carriers for I-15 and I-16 fighters.
