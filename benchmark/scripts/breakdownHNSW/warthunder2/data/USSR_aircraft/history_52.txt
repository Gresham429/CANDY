History of Pe-3bis: 
After the initial introduction of the Pe-3 fighter to frontline units, pilots reported several issues with the aircraft. Importantly, the flash from the forward guns frequently blinded the pilot, due to the aircraft's frequent use as a night fighter. As a result, the Petlyakov design bureau began working on an improved version of the Pe-3, called the Pe-3bis. The first prototype was developed in September and October of 1941.
