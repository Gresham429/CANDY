Description of MiG-21F-13: 
Only a few months before the introduction of the MiG-21F into Soviet service, the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis took place in 1958, where the AIM-9B Sidewinder missile employed by F-86 Sabres became the first instance of air-to-air missiles being used in combat. However, these early missiles had many flaws, and on September 28, 1958, one AIM-9B failed to detonate while striking a PLAAF MiG-17, becoming lodged in the rear fuselage and returning to base completely intact. This missile was quickly shipped back to the Soviet Union for analysis and backwards engineered into the K-13 missile system. A quick directive was issued to update existing (MiG-17 and MiG-19) and future aircraft projects (MiG-21) to use this new missile. An updated variant of the MiG-21F with one cannon removed to fit the required avionics for firing the K-13 missile would enter service shortly after as the MiG-21F-13.
