Description of MiG-27M: 
Following the major upgrades to the MiG-27, which entered service as the MiG-27K in the late 1970s, the Soviet Air Force requested a cheaper variant to complement the MiG-27K (which was deemed too expensive to field completely). The new cheaper variant was projected to support the MiG-27K fleet at a 2:1 ratio at least, and was developed after the MiG-27K. This new variant, the MiG-27M, would retain the upgrades allowing it to use laser and TV-guided weapons, but would lack the upgraded avionics and advanced Kayra-23 laser-optical targeting system, instead settling on a cheaper and more readily available targeting system taken from the Su-17 Fitter family. This variant would enter service with not only the USSR, but also many export countries throughout the 1980s.
