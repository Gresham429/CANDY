Usage of Su-2_(M-82): 
This plane has decent armour that can stop anything with less power than a 7.62 mm armour-piercing round. The powerful offensive armament pours bullets at targets and is great at taking down planes and destroying SPAAs in mixed battles. This plane doesn't need air superiority to be effective however it is suggested as you can take more time in destroying ground targets using equipped ordnance.
