Usage of Tu-14T: 
Much like the IL-28, the Tu-14T can be used in a variety of roles, from a fast base bomber to ground attacker. However, because it is more sluggish than the IL-28 and has less ammo for its offensive guns, it is far less effective at being an impromptu fighter. Because of its slower speed compared to the IL-28, the Tu-14T will be more easily intercepted, requiring the player to rely more on its 23 mm turret to knock out or deter enemy planes.
