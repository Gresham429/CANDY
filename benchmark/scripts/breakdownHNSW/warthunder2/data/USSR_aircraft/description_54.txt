Description of IL-4: 
The IL-4 was a Soviet twin-engined bomber designed with the intent of being deployed as a medium bomber. It was developed in the 1930s by the Ilyushin Design Bureau and entered service in 1941. It was operated by both the Soviet Air Force, which mostly utilized it for frontline bombing, and the Navy, which made extensive use of it for torpedo bombing missions throughout World War II, incorporating 45-36AN torpedoes into their variant. With a top speed of 400 km/h and a range of over 2,000 kilometres, the IL-4 was also sporadically used as a strategic bomber. It had a crew of four and could carry a remarkable payload of up to 2,000 kg of bombs. Subsequent efforts to enhance its capabilities led to the development of the IL-6. Despite the promising advances, the project was eventually canceled, leaving the IL-4 as the final bomber in its family. By 1949, it had been entirely phased out.
