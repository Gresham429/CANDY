History of Yak-4: 
The Yakovlev Yak-4 was a light bomber developed from the Yak-2 light bomber (not to be confused with the Yak-2 KABB attacker), the result of a series of improvements implemented to rectify the issues of its predecessor, which included inadequate speed, an unsatisfactory cooling system, and a weak/troublesome undercarriage. To increase speed, the drag of engine doors and cowlings was reduced, the fuselage upper decking was cut down, and the aircraft was refitted with Klimov M-105 engines. Such improvements increased the speed by 10-20 km/h. To reduce overheating, the oil coolers were relocated to the chin of the engine compartments. To fix problems with the undercarriage, the single wheeled landing gear was replaced with a double wheeled one. The Yak-4 first flew on February 20, 1940, was put into service in 1941, and had its production terminated that same year. A majority of the aircraft were sent to the 316th Reconnaissance Regiment in the Kiev Military District. Although officially retired in 1945, it is not believed that their usage extended much past Operation Barbarossa as the German forces destroyed most of them in its opening days, in large part due to the inexperience of soviet aircrews. However, a few remaining Yak-4s may have found use later in the war as glider tugs or suppliers. A total of around 90 were produced.
