Description of Su-17M4: 
During the late 1970s, a final and ultimate modernization of the Su-17M fighter-bomber was ordered. The aircraft was upgraded with RSDN navigation, Klyon-57 laser targeting system, SPO-15LE RWR system, the IT-23M optical targeting system for the TUBUS-3 seeker on the Kh-29T missile, and the ability to use the BA-58 targeting system for anti-radiation missiles. The only way to externally distinguish the Su-17M4 over its predecessor, the Su-17M3, is by the presence of multiple extra bleed-air intakes in the rear fuselage, the most noticable one being at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The aircraft would first fly in 1980 and quickly enter service shortly after, supplementing the Su-17M3 fleet throughout the '80s and early '90s, when it was finally withdrawn from Russian service shortly after the dissolution of the USSR. At least one Su-17M4 remains in private service today with Sukhoi, performing the peaceful role of a camera chase plane.
