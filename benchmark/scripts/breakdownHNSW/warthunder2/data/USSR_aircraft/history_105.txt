History of I-225: 
The experimental high-altitude fighter/interceptor I-225 was created in the Mikoyan design bureau as part of work to develop new prototypes of fighter aircraft with new engines. The first experimental prototype was finished by May 9, 1944. The aircraft was designed to carry a powertrain consisting of a 2,000 horsepower aircraft engine and a turbocharger. Its armament in comparison with previous prototypes was strengthened and consisted of four 20 mm ShVAK cannons. In testing (primarily tests of the fighter's speed and altitude options) the aircraft showed impressive results: it could reach a speed of almost 560 km/h near the ground and 720 km/h at high altitude. Just two I-225s were built for testing purposes. For various reasons, both aircraft crashed in testing. After a range of improvements and upgrades, in March 1947 work on this project was stopped.
