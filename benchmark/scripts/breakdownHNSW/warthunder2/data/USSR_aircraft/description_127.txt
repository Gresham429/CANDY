Description of Tu-1: 
While working on the Tu-2 bomber, Tupolev was inspired to design a multipurpose aircraft capable of intercepting, bomber escort, and ground attack. First, a Tu-2 was modified to fit this task, and the military was interested enough to authorize the development of the new aircraft as a heavy fighter. Even when the war broke, the development continued, although this was slowed due to the Tu-2 becoming a priority. The aircraft was specially designed for interception and ground attack, featuring a radar in the nose, two 45 mm NS-45 guns installed in the front of the bomb bay, and two 23 mm NS-23 guns in the wings. With a crew of three, one pilot and two defensive gunners, the entire back of the aircraft was covered, both above and below the fuselage. While the tests in 1947 for the aircraft were successful, jet-powered aircraft started to be more and more common, and thus the project was scrapped.
