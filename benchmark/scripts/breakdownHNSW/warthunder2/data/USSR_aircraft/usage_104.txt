Usage of Yak-9UT: 
Since this aircraft has a very high low-to-middle altitude acceleration, you should use this plane primarily as a dogfighter at those altitudes. It is also important to note that this plane like all Yaks and like most other Soviet-built fighters, low high-altitude performance, however, even at higher altitudes, this fighter can be used as a Boom & Zoom aircraft, provided you pay attention to your speed. Turnfighting and dogfighting above 4,500 m are discouraged as at this altitude, many other aircraft will have superior turn capabilities and engine performance compared to the Yak-9UT, leaving it to struggle for any flight advantage.
