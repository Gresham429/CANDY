Usage of MiG-23MLD: 
The MiG-23MLD is a fairly forgiving fighter that can be used for many approaches. Players who want to beeline straight into battle and jump in dogfights will be satisfied by its great acceleration and dogfight performance. Those who prefer to hang back can use its climb rate to build up altitude and energy while observing the battle below. From this point, fans of long range combat can sling the R-24R radar-guided missiles to snipe targets at long range or low altitude, and opportunistic pilots can sneak in from the sidelines and use the IRST in conjunction with the R-24T IR missiles to eliminate distracted targets. The MiG-23MLD does not reign supreme in the pure beyond-visual-range role because it can only carry two R-24Rs compared to the four AIM-7E-2s or Skyflashes carried by the F-4EJ Kai Phantom II and Phantom FGR.2 for example, so one should plan on getting close and dogfighting at some point to not let the MLD's full capabilities go to waste.
