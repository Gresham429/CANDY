Usage of Yak-30D: 
If downtiered, Boom & Zoom is the tactic that should be employed with the Yak-30; it is key to keep your speed above 750 km/h at all times to give yourself a chance of running away if the engagement you are partaking in turns into the enemies favour. Although the Yak-30 at the specified speed is able to turn with most of its targets, don't depend on turning with your enemy as you may be caught off guard and unable to react if another enemy player enters the engagement. If you encounter an enemy who is on par or faster than your Yak-30, refer to the paragraph below.
