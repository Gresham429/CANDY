History of Hunter_FGA.9: 
Towards the end of the 1950s, the Royal Air Force was faced with the increasing obsolescence of the de Havilland Venom FB.4 in the ground attack role. At the time, the Venom was still in use as a Close Air Support aircraft both in South East Asia and the Middle East; especially in the Aden Emergency it was intensely used, and as a result, a replacement was urgently required. In 1958 the Royal Air Force started the Venom Replacement Evaluation Trials (VRET), selecting the Royal Air Force bases of RAF Khormaksar (Aden) with its long paved runway, and RAF Riyan (Quaiti State, Eastern Aden Protectorate) with its unhardened airstrip as trials bases.
