Usage of MB.5: 
The primary, (and practically only) tactics when using the MB.5 is as an air superiority fighter or as an interceptor. This is given the MB.5 does not mount any external weapons, which renders it useless against ground vehicles unless it is an AA truck or open-topped vehicle. Aside from that, the two methods of using this plane are very similar, but there are some differences to using them.
