Description of Wyvern_S4: 
Interest in a long-range naval strike fighter gave rise to the Wyvern project, which was to take the Rolls-Royce Eagle-22 engine to cover operations. The project was struck with setbacks, most eventful was the cancellation of the Eagle engine causing considerable time and effort to be lost when searching for another suitable engine that was available. It was decided to utilize a turboprop engine instead and the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine was selected for installation into the Wyvern. The Wyvern with the Python engine was accepted into service in 1953, designated the Wyvern TF 4 initially before renamed into the Wyvern S4. Seeing limited service in the Fleet Air Arm as a carrier aircraft, it was eventually withdrawn in 1958.
