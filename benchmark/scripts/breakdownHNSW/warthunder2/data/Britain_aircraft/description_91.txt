Description of Shackleton_MR.Mk.2: 
The Avro Shackleton is the final military version of the venerated Lancaster series of bombers. Developed in 1945 from the now-obsolete Avro Lincoln as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and maritime patrol aircraft, the Shackleton featured more specialized armaments, such as a naval radar housed inside a distinctive "bulge" on the belly of the aircraft. The tail gunner position is removed in favour of a flexible mount with 20 mm Hispano Mk.V autocannons to strafe naval targets. The plane also features more efficient Rolls-Royce Griffon engines powering contra-rotating propellers.
