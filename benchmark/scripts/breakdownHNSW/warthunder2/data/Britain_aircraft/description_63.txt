Description of Seafire_LF_Mk.III: 
The Seafire LF Mk.III was a British WWII carrier-based fighter based on the Spitfire Mk Vc. It was the first version of the navalized Spitfire that featured manually folding wings, allowing for easier storage and accommodating of more fighters in the hangar bay and on the deck of an aircraft carrier. A more powerful engine was also installed, namely the Merlin 55 for the F MK III or Merlin 55M for L Mk III. A slim Aero-Vee air filter and six stack ejector type exhausts were fitted to the plane as well. The Mk III was the most produced variant of a Seafire with 1,220 built: 870 by Westland and 350 by Cunliffe Owen. In 1947, 12 Seafire Mk IIIs were stripped of naval equipment such as arresting hooks and handed over to the Irish Air Corps.
