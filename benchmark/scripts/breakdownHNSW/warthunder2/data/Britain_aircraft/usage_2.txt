Usage of Fury_Mk_II: 
The Fury Mk II is similar to the Mk I in terms of usage,  although it is slightly faster, but not by much. It has good manoeuvrability to avoid being shot at, so turning is one of its strong points, but there are still some enemy planes that will be able to out turn it. Working with your team will greatly increase the chances for survival and to score a kill during engagement.
