Usage of Firefly_FR_Mk_V: 
The Firefly FR Mk V is one of the least manoeuvrable aircraft in its grade, especially before upgrades. The engine is severely limited by the aerodynamic drag, with the wings losing a lot of performance at lower speeds. The lack of turn-fighting capabilities makes engaging in a fight with the enemy ill-advised. In a straight line, the plane can somewhat retain its speed, but it can't outrun its contemporaries at the rank.
