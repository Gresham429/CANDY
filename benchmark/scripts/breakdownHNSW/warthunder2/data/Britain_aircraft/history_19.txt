History of Hurricane_Mk_IIB/Trop: 
The plain one. The dumpy one. The unsexy sister of the glamorous Spitfire, its partner in the Battle of Britain. The plane that took, according to some sources, roughly 60 per cent of the accounted kills during that air campaign in World War II. The plane in which the only Victoria Cross for Fighter Command was won by Ft Lt. James Nicolson. The plane in which a foreigner, the Czech Sgt. Josef Franti≈°ek gained the third most victories of all pilots during the Battle of Britain: he gained 17 victories. The history of the Hurricane is not only interesting as it tells us something about the plane, but it is also equally important as it tells us about the desperate struggle in which it took part.
