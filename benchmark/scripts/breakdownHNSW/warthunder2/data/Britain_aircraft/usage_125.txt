Usage of Lightning_F.53: 
The Lightning F.53 is not unique for its battle-rating, if you've played the F-104, you may find it very similar. However, the Lightning F.53 gets load-outs for ground targets that should not be ignored. It can carry enough payload to destroy entire convoys or bases while still carrying its two anti-air missiles. The bombs might feel compromising as they can only be dropped when flying under Mach 1, while the Lightning F.53 benefits from going over Mach 1 and generally just naturally reaches speeds above that; If you wish not to sacrifice speed, a loadout can be used of the two air-to-air missiles and rocket pods for the rest of the hardpoints, the 144 SNEB rockets are enough to take out one base (but at Mach speed, the rockets are suboptimal for attacking convoys).
