Usage of Buccaneer_S.1: 
In Realistic Battles, the Buccaneer's focus is bombing as it has zero air-to-air capability. Be careful on take-off with a full load, use most of the runway and get up to a good 350 km/h IAS before retracting gear and flaps. The aircraft can get up to its top-speed in level flight fully-loaded eventually. However, doing this will often lead to bad results. The best tactic is to gently side climb, get to around 550 km/h IAS and then climb at around 12 degrees keeping IAS above 500 km/h until reaching a position to strike from. Keep a careful eye on the positions of enemies and try and stay a healthy distance from them. Line up with the ground targets Drop into a shallow dive which will quickly increase speeds to ~1000 km/h. Once empty, it's often possible to fly straight back to the airfield and reload. On a return trip, if the friendly team has an advantage, fly straight back towards your target otherwise repeat the above manoeuvres.
