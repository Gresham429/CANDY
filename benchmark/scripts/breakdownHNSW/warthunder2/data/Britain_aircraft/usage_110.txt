Usage of Swift_F.7: 
The Swift F.7 is played similar to the Hunter as more of a Boom and Zoom aircraft, though it retains dogfighting capability. The aircraft has a sweet spot for its manoeuvrability around 600-800 km/h. Above those speeds, sustaining a hard turn (or alternatively turning and rolling simultaneously) can result in a ripped wing. It is generally advised to keep some altitude with the aircraft. The missiles are SACLOS-guided and can be useful in head-on. The vehicle has an afterburner which results in higher acceleration than most jets that you will face, though opponents such as the Shenyang F-5 and AV-8A Harrier are capable of accelerating faster. It is recommended to use either 20 minutes of fuel or full tank as 7 minutes does not allow for prolonged use of the afterburner, nor does it allow for loitering.
