Usage of Sea_Fury_FB_11: 
In Realistic battles, the Sea Fury is a decent plane. It will struggle a little in the early parts of the battle, as its climb rate is only slightly above average. It will not be able to outclimb other fighters like the Bf 109, G.56 or many Japanese interceptors, so climbing straight towards the map centre is not recommended.
After meeting the enemy it can struggle to outturn them, its turn rate is at most as good as the Fw 190 D, dogfighting with anything will usually end badly for it, also when forced onto the defensive it will have some difficulties in scissors and other manoeuvres because of mediocre roll rate and low flap speed limits. Forcing an opponent into head-on situations might have mixed results, as although the plane has four cannons with good muzzle velocity, they are placed in its wings, so any plane with nose-mounted cannons (G.55, G.56, C.205N, Bf 109) will have a higher probability of getting a hit.
The most suited role for this plane is trying to gain the altitude advantage over the target and utilize its good high speed handling by performing Boom and Zoom, or go for Hit and Run tactics. Its ammo count is high so it can destroy a few planes this way in one flight and the player will not have to worry about the ammunition amount so much.
Its level speed is better or equal to most planes that it will meet, so for example outrunning the Bf 109 G should not be a problem, especially since it also has a higher structural speed limit.
