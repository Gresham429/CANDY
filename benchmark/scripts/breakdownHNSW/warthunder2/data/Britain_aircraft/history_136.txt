History of JAS39C: 
In the late 1990s, South Africa found a need to replace its aging fleet of Mirage and Cheetah fighter jets. Looking to modernize their fleet for not only national defense, but for a better standing for their defense modernization and strategic autonomy in the global stage, South Africa sought options in the market under the Advanced Light Fighter Aircraft (ALFA) program. The decision was made and announced in November 1998 that the Swedish-made Gripen has been chosen to fulfill the program's need, with 28 Gripens to be purchased at a price of 1.5 billion USD in 1999 (this would be changed to 26 Gripens in 2005). Alongside the purchase deal was South Africa's involvement with Saab's Industrial Participation programme, which enabled South Africa's local industries to help produce and maintain Gripen parts, such as Denel Aviation producing the rear fuselage sections of the Gripen.
