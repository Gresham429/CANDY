Description of Nimrod_Mk_II: 
The Hawker Nimrod was a carrier-borne, biplane fighter which entered service with Britain's Fleet Air Arm in 1931. By 1934, full-scale production of Nimrod Mk I fighters was replaced by that of Mk II fighters. All Nimrod Mk IIs were fitted with an arrestor hook for carrier operations, their wings were modified with a slight sweep back and tail surfaces were slightly larger than those of the Nimrod Mk I. The powerplant was also improved in the Mk II; a 608 hp Rolls-Royce Kestrel V liquid cooled, in-line engine replaced the earlier 590 hp engine. The Hawker Nimrod fighter was replaced in first-line units by the Gloster Sea Gladiator and the Blackburn Skua before the start of World War II. Nimrods continued to be operated as training and liaison aircraft until July 1941. At the end only 30 units of the Mk.II variant were ever built.
