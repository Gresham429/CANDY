Usage of Lincoln_B_Mk_II: 
The Lincoln plays similarly to how one would expect a British heavy bomber to; a slow, lumbering beast with a massive payload and mediocre defensive capabilities. Those who are comfortable with the Lancaster series will feel right at home with the Lincoln, as it is better in nearly every way possible. Altitude, speed and cloud cover are your best friends while flying the Lincoln, and its never a bad idea to have a few escort fighters around. Ideally, you should climb to around 5,000 - 6,000 m before beginning your run, turn your tail to any would-be attackers so you can light them up with your Hispanos, drop your bombs, then head back to base to reload your bombs for another run. Of course this strategy varies depending on your current situation and environment, but they all generally follow the same pattern.
