Usage of Swordfish_Mk_I: 
The Swordfish is  largely confined to the early ranks, where it is moderately effective as a bomber. While it is slow and poorly armed, it is quite manoeuvrable and carries a decent payload. Therefore, it is strictly relegated to bombing and torpedo bombing. During ground realistic battles, the Swordfish can be great for accurately bombing enemy vehicles, but it will be a very easy target for SPAA, enemy fighters, and especially American tanks like the M2A2 or the Sherman 105. Therefore you must be careful and try to drop your bombs as quickly as possible before returning to base to rearm. Hanging around once your bombs are gone will quickly get you shot down. Pinpoint the target at a distance, drop the bombs and then escape before AA can respond. In this aircraft, it is advisable to fly low to use trees, hills, rocks, and other terrain features.
