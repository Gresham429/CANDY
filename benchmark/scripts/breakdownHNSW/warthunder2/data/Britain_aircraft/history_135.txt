History of Sea_Harrier_FRS.1: 
The Hawker Siddeley Harrier "Jump-Jet" has been a successful attack aircraft for multiple users, most notably the RAF themselves as the quick-response aircrafts against possible Warsaw-Pact assaults in case of the destruction of NATO airbases as the Harrier could utilize its V/STOL capability to mobilize and attack enemy targets before the reinforcements arrived. After its commission in 1969, the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm also need the Harrier as they opted for a ski-jump style flight deck instead of conventional designs with catapult; the resulting jet was the Sea Harrier FRS.1 for the need to intercept Soviet AShM guidance aircrafts, 24 jets were ordered to the then-Hawker Siddeley, but the first prototype jet arrived in April 1978 after the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 and built by the merged British Aerospace, only to be declared operational by FAA in 1981. The jet achieved 20 recorded victories over Argentine aircrafts with no losses during the Falkland War and were saw action in the Bosnian War.
