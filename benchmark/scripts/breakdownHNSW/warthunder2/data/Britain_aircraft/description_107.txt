Description of Sea_Hawk_FGA.6: 
At the tail end of World War II, Hawker Aircraft's design team was working on a way to utilize new jet engine technology. Hawker utilized a modified Sea Fury who would be the basis for their new jet aircraft. Adapting the plane to the new Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine required substantial reworking of the aircraft fuselage. Initially, the British Air Ministry showed little interest in the aircraft. Thus later Hawker pitched the idea of the plane to the navy, which was not overly enthused about the project, though ultimately accepted three prototypes due to the long-range potential of these aircraft.
