History of Beaufighter_Mk_I_(40-mm): 
By 1941, 20 Beaufighters were reserved solely for testing. The 4th prototype, R2055, was modified by replacing its standard armament with 2 40 mm guns. The gun mounted on the port fuselage was a Rolls-Royce BH, and the starboard fuselage gun was a Vickers S. The trials involving R2055 eventually lead to the the development of an anti-tank Hawker Hurricane Mk IID, mounting 2 of the Vickers guns tested on the Beaufighter.[1]
