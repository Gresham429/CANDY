Usage of Wellington_Mk_Ic: 
The Wellington Mk Ic offers great payload options for all types of bomber pilots, however beware of enemy fighters. Enemy fighters are your bane, the Wellington Mk Ic only has four turrets, two turrets in the side of the fuselage then one in the front and rear of the plane. If the rear turret is knocked out, only way to evade enemy fighters is to turn and perform defensive manoeuvres and try to get the enemy fighter with one of your other turrets.
