Usage of F-4J(UK)_Phantom_II: 
The F-4J (UK) is a great aircraft but will feel out of place to new players. The main attraction to any Phantom is its missiles, however Skyflash missiles do not complement the F-4J(UK)'s gameplay. Being essentially an improved AIM-7E-2 Sparrow, the Skyflash does not have the long range performance of the AIM-7F Sparrow nor AIM-7M Sparrow (Skyflash with a 50 km launch range compared to AIM-7F's 100 km launch range). Not to mention you cannot roll out of the way of these high performance SARH missiles, forcing you to dump your lock and go 90Â° to attempt to force the missiles to overlead the other direction. In terms of raw G performance however, the Skyflash will absolutely pull all 25 Gs to hit a target (especially at short range) if you can maintain a radar lock. As a dogfight missile, the Skyflash starts pulling "off the rail", and will start pulling as soon as it clears the plane. Don't be afraid to fire at a non maneuvering target just within 2 kilometers (in a direct head on engagement).
