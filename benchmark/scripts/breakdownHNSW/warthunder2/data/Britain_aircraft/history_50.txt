History of DB-7_(Great_Britain): 
The Douglas DB-7 was an American-built light bomber and attack aircraft used by the French, American, Soviet and British Commonwealth air forces during WWII. The French air force was the first air force to order the DB-7 (designated Boston at the time): as a result, the French DB-7s were the first to see service, fighting German units during the Battle of France. The DB-7 would later serve in the air forces of multiple air forces as an attacker, bomber and night fighter.
