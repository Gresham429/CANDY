Description of Canberra_B_Mk_2: 
In 1944, the Air Ministry issued a specification for a new high-speed, high-altitude bomber to replace the illustrious de Havilland Mosquito. While English Electric had been involved in aircraft construction since the interwar period, including producing airframes for the Handley Page Hampden and Halifax, they had little design experience of their own. However, this was solved by the joining of W.E.W. Petter, Westland's chief designer, who had left Westland to pursue his own twin-engine fighter-bomber design after being rejected. By 1949, the first prototypes had taken flight, and in 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, 410 aircraft were ordered for the RAF, as well as a number for export, notably the US (license-produced as the B-57A) and Australia. The first production run, designated Canberra B Mk 2, entered RAF service in 1951, replacing the Mosquito and Lincoln in frontline bombing and photoreconnaissance roles.
