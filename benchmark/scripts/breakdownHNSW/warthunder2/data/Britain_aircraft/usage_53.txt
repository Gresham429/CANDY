Usage of Boomerang_Mk_I_(Great_Britain): 
The Mk I Boomerang is not very fast for a fighter for its BR at roughly 460 km/h at sea level with WEP, and it loses power very quickly starting at an altitude of 4,000 meters due to a lack of a supercharged engine. From this, it would be thought that the Boomerang isn't much of a capable fighter, as many of its opponents are capable of reaching 500 km/h at any altitude. Despite this, the Boomerang makes up for this as it possesses great manoeuvrability due to its good roll rate and decent Power/Weight ratio. However, Boom and Zoom tactics are also possible with the Boomerang if an altitude advantage is present, as its decent rip speed, lack of rudder-stiffness at high speed and good rate of climb allows it to make passes on any enemies unfortunate enough to be underneath it.
