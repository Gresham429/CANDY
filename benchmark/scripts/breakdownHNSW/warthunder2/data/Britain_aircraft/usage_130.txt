Usage of Phantom_FG.1: 
The Phantom FG.1 is the ultimate energy fighter. Its advantages over other aircraft are sheer power, roll rate, and its ability to climb to high altitudes. It has good speed and thrust-to-weight ratio at lower altitudes. The twin Rolls-Royce Spey 203 engines produce just over 9,000 kgf thrust when stationary- that is to say, on the runway- and over 10,000 kgf at near-supersonic speeds.
