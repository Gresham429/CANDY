Usage of Firebrand_TF_Mk_IV: 
In Arcade battles, the Firebrand can actually excel. There are no speed limits or breakage and performance is exaggerated. Thus, the Firebrand can be used somewhat effectively as a fighter. Turning and handling are both still poor performers with this aircraft compared with Realistic battle while the climb rate is significantly increased.
