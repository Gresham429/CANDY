Description of Hornet_Mk.I: 
The de Havilland Hornet was a twin engine fighter developed by the de Havilland Company as a high altitude long range interceptor at the end of WWII. The Hornet saw most of its action in the colonies of the Pacific, its long range allowed it to cover large areas of sea and land in areas without proper infrastructure or services to maintain large fleets of aircraft. The Hornet Mk.I was the first variant of the Hornet with 60 units built. A total of 383 Hornets were built between all variants in the span of 5 years (1945-1950). It served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy from 1946 to 1956.
