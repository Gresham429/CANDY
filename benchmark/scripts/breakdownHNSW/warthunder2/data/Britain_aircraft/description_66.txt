Description of Brigand_B_1: 
Development for the Brigand began as a successor to the Beaufighter, namely as a strike aircraft and torpedo bomber. Bristol used their existing Buckingham aircraft design as the basis, but development delays caused the plane to not be ready until after the war in 1946. Without a war to fight, the Brigand was utilized for training or lower-intensity conflicts such as the communist insurgency in Malaya.
