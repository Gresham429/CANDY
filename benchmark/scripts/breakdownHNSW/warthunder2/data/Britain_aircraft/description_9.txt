Description of V-156-B1: 
The V-156-B1 was an export version of the American SB2U bomber, various modifications of which were released from 1936-1941. Since 1941, the V-156-B1 had been transferred to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease program. The most important difference between the SB2U-2 and V-156-B1 is the armament. The V-156-B1 has four 7.7 mm machine guns, while the SB2U-2 has two. Due to the small number of such aircraft, they were not actively used in combat operations. Most of them were used as training aircraft. The last aircraft was withdrawn from service in Great Britain in 1944. A total of 49 V-156-B1 were produced.
