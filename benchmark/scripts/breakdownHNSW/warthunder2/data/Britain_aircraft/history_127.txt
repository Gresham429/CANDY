History of Buccaneer_S.1: 
The Blackburn Buccaneer was developed in the early stages of the Cold War as a response to new cruisers being built by the Soviet Union at the time. After the first prototype conducted its maiden flight in the late 1950's, it didn't take long for the first production version - the Buccaneer S.1 - to enter service with the Fleet Air Arm in the early 1960's.
