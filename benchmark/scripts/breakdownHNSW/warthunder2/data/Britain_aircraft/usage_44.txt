Usage of Corsair_F_Mk_II_(Great_Britain): 
Due to its great energy retention and high dive speed, the Corsair F Mk II is very good at Boom & Zoom manoeuvres. It is recommended to be used this way especially against any Japanese planes. Against any German aircraft, Boom & Zoom operations are still recommended, however, some planes you can out turn (FW-190 A-4) and may pose a threat by using this advantage and reversing the attacker/defender roles. As with every American fighter, always climb at the start of a match. Typically, to be successful with this plane it is best to climb higher than the enemy fighters and attack them with an energy advantage. Using this tactic will greatly increase your chances of picking your battles and forcing the enemy down to lower altitudes low where either you or your teammates you can finish them off.
