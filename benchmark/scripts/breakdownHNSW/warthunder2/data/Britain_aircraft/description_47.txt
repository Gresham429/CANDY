Description of Firecrest: 
The Firecrest, given the SBAC designation YA.1, was a single-engine naval strike fighter built by Blackburn Aircraft for service with the British Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War. Developed over the troubled Blackburn Firebrand for aircraft operations, three prototypes were created but only two actually flew. The aircraft suffered from many problems, changes in design requirements, lack of components and the halted development of more capable piston engines cemented its destiny. This problems delayed the aircraft production until 1947. At this point, aircrafts like the Meteor started to become more common and other jet powered attackers were already in development, so the Firecrest was deemed obsolete for its time.
