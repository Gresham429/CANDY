Description of Lightning_F.53: 
During the late '60s, when the Lightning was no longer considered "cutting edge" and the RAF was in the process of acquiring F-4 Phantoms, the MoD greenlit the export of the Lightning to close Middle Eastern allies, namely Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The export variants were divided into two types, the Lightning F.52 being ex-RAF Lightning F.6 converted for export, and F.53 being newly built specialized ground-attack export models of the F.6, with more hardpoints for bombs or unguided rocket pods. A total of 46 were built, 12 F.53Ks for the Kuwaiti Air Force and 34 F.53s for the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force, with one aircraft crashing during shakedown tests before delivery, resulting in a hasty replacement F.53 being rebuilt from an old F.6 airframe to meet the delivery time. Saudi Arabia received their first F.53 in 1967, and would extensively use them until 1986 when the Saudis starting trying to acquire the Tornado IDS to replace it, which they successfully completed in 1989 with the first Tornado IDS deliveries in that same year.
