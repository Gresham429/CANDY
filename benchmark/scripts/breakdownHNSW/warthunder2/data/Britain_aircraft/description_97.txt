Description of Spitfire_F_Mk_XIVc: 
The Spitfire F Mk XIVc was the product of installing a Rolls-Royce Griffon 60 engine into the fuselage of the existing Spitfire Mk VIII, which was an experimental series of about 100 Griffon-powered Spitfires. The fuselage was lengthened to 9.95 m and new wing fuel tanks had to be installed due to higher fuel consumption of the Griffon engine compared to the previous Merlin. The Mk XIVc also received a new five-blade Rotol propeller and a "C"-type wing with two 20 mm Hispano cannons and four 7.7 mm Browning machine guns. The Mk XIVs were primarily used as a V-1 flying bomb hunters due to their high speed while utilizing 150 octane fuel.
