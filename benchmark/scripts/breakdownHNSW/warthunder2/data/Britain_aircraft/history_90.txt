The actual design came from Air Ministry specification B.14/43. Which called for an improved piston-engined heavy bomber to replace the Avro Lancaster, Short Stirling, and Handley Page Halifax. The first designs differed from the Lancaster by having a longer, stronger wing span. It also had an enlarged fuselage that could carry 4.5 tonnes of various armaments and bombs. It also has a higher operational ceiling and longer range compared to the Avro Lancaster.
