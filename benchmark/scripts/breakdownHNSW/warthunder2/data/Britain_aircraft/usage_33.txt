Usage of Beaufighter_Mk_21: 
The final Beaufighter in the research tree can be characterized primarily by its main armament.  At its BR in air battles there's barely anything that comes close to the firepower 4 x 20mm cannons and 4 x 12.7 mm machine guns provide; this is especially notable considering the superior layout of the cannons, with all four clustered right under the cockpit, making precise aiming far easier. If there's anything to be desired - it's the Minengescho√ü of the German counterpart for the 20 mm cannons. This Beaufighter can swiftly tear apart enemy fighters and bombers alike, typically in a single sweep if aimed accurately. This makes it a potent fighter in a number of circumstances and giving it a fighting chance even if its an underdog in the encounter.
