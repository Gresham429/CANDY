History of Hurricane_Mk_I/L: 
Whilst the iconic Supermarine Spitfire is commonly associated with the RAF's role in the Battle of Britain, its stablemate and fellow frontline fighter at the time is often overlooked. The rugged and reliable Hawker Hurricane, first flown in November of 1935, claimed some 60% of the RAF's aerial victories in the summer of 1940 above Britain against the Luftwaffe's Bf 109 E, Bf 110, He 111, Ju 87, Ju 88 and Do 17 types to name a few.
