History of F-4J(UK)_Phantom_II: 
In 1984, following the deployment of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands, the UK government decided that the gap this left in the UK air defences needed to be filled. They therefore sought to purchase another squadron of Phantoms, but as the ones already in RAF service were a special production batch it would not be possible to have the new ones be identical. It was decided that 15 Phantoms would be obtained from ex-USN F-4Js that were in storage. The F-4J was chosen as it was the closest to the current RAF Phantoms.
