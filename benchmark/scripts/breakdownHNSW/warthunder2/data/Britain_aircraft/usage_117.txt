Usage of Hunter_F.6: 
The Hunter F.6 is a transonic aircraft in level flight but can reach supersonic in a dive. That means that it is faster than other subsonic aircraft it will face but slower than supersonic aircraft like the F-100D and the MiG-19PT. Make sure to maintain speed, as it is most manoeuvrable at higher speeds, and very slow to turn when slow. The energy retention is almost an order of magnitude higher than supersonic aircraft, which bleed speed in sharp turns, this can be both a blessing and a curse, when in a prolonged turning engagement, your energy retention advantage will allow you to pull away from a supersonic at the end of a turn; however, a plane such as the F-100D can use it's worse energy retention to stay on your tail. In many situations, when you have a supersonic on your tail, making them overshoot is very difficult, but if you can, the SRAAMS will make short work of them. When facing subsonic aircraft, simply outrun them with your superior speed, try not to engage in a turn-fight with subsonic aircraft, as they are often able to best you in a dogfight, especially at low speeds, where the Hunter really shows its weaknesses. The plane, under most circumstances, does not rip it's wings, even under extended, high G turns; although if you combine a 9-10 G turn and roll or yaw, the plane can rip. Unlike some other planes, you have almost no chance of making it back to the airfield with a broken wing.
