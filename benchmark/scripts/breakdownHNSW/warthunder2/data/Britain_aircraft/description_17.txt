Description of Swordfish_Mk_II: 
The Swordfish Mk.II is the successor of the Swordfish Mk.I, the primary carrier-based torpedo bomber of the Royal Air Force. Despite being extremely obsolete by the outbreak of the Second World war, the Swordfish remained a crucial asset to the Fleet Air Arm. The Swordfish Mk II was developed as the second iteration of the Swordfish and was first introduced in 1943. It was fitted with a new, metal lower wing section, allowing it to carry rockets on underwing racks.[1] The Swordfish Mk II saw extensive service as a convoy escort, in the Atlantic and in the Arctic. During the course of the Second World War, the Swordfish distinguished itself as a highly reliable reconnaissance and torpedo bomber aircraft. It managed to sink several German submarines and was used to harass Axis convoys.
