Usage of Spitfire_Mk_Vc/trop: 
The Spitfire Mark Vc/trop, unlike the older Mk IIb variant, no longer has overwhelming edges in performance over its opposition. This aircraft is heavier than its predecessors, and has an engine that does better at an altitude range that is much lower than its predecessors. The Spitfire Mk Vc/trop flies best at altitudes between the 2,000 m and 3,500 m range and its engine starts to suffer above this altitude. This plane must be played radically differently in terms of when and where to pick fights. As usual, the 7 P's of Combat apply: Proper Perusal, Planning and Preparation Prevent Poor Performance.
