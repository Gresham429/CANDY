Usage of Typhoon_Mk_Ib/L: 
The Typhoon Mk Ib/L, like the other Typhoons, is a superb altitude fighter, able to dive down on unaware enemies and strike; then take off with the speed it gained from diving to gain a high altitude for the purpose of either doing a second pass on an enemy or to engage a new enemy target. It has a great speed for a 4.3/4.7(RB/AB) but its insufficient climbing speed makes it possible for enemy threats to outclimb it.
