Usage of Spitfire_Mk.IIa_Venture_I: 
The Spitfire Mk.IIa Venture I is an excellent low to medium altitude dogfighter. Lacking a supercharger, it shouldn't be used at high altitudes. In Air RB, it's best to climb to around 3,500-4,000 m (11,500-13,200 ft) where the Merlin XII engine performs optimally. After climbing, release WEP and reduce throttle to below 95% to cool the engine until you've found a target. When engaging opponents, diving should be carefully executed to avoid speeds of 450 km/h (280 mph) or greater, where control surfaces begin to suddenly stiffen. In combat, the light airframe and powerful engine provides a respectable rate of climb and an incredibly tight turning circle, combined with its eight browning machine guns, it is capable of eliminating enemy targets in short, controlled bursts. Poor weapon management will deplete your 2,800 rounds of ammunition quickly because individually, the machine guns are not very powerful. Concentrate and aim for the engine, cockpit or wings where your bullets will be most efficient at destroying vital components, such as wing spars or control surfaces.
