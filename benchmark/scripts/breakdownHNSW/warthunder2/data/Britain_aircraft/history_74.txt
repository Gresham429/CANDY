History of Typhoon_Mk_Ib: 
The Typhoon Mk Ib was an evolution on the earlier Mk Ia on a quest for better overall performance. An upgraded engine that could take higher boost settings and aerodynamic improvements on the fuselage and wings increased speed and climb capability. The four cannons and the improved hardpoints under the wings made it ideal for the ground attack tactics employed by the RAF in 1943 over France. The Spitfires and Hurricanes were quickly replaced by the Typhoons in this very dangerous mission profile, flying close to the ground and exposed to AA. The Typhoon was also used in a defensive role as interceptor against fast German fighter bombers coming across the Channel.
