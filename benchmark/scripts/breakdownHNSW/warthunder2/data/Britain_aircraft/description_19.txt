Description of Hurricane_Mk_IIB/Trop: 
The Hurricane Mk IIB/Trop is a tropicalized variant of the Hawker Hurricane Mk II. Compared to the Mark I version, the Mark II featured an addition of four 7.7 mm Browning machine guns in the outer leading edge of the wings along with bomb racks. The increase in number of small-calibre guns was due to the British still being reluctant to use the then notoriously jammable Hispano autocannons, and believing that adding more guns would compensate for lack of hard-hitting firepower that the Hispano could offer. While this only held true against lighter aircraft at closer range, the sheer number of guns and additional bomb racks allowed the Hurricane to find its new niche as a ground attacker during the Africa campaign, while leaving the air combat duties to the more nimble Spitfire instead.
