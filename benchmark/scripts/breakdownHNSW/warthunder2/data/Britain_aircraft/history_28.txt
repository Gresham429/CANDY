History of Sea_Hurricane_Mk_IC: 
As the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) was very slow on developing a modern ship-borne fighter in the interbellum, the Gloster Gladiator was adapted to the role in 1938. However, the situation in Norway in 1940 made it painfully clear that the RAF was not able to support expeditionary operations from bases in the United Kingdom and the Gladiator was very much obsolete. To worsen the crisis, Britain had lost HMS Courageous and Glorious in the failed Norwegian campaign and had no quick way to replace the carriers. During the campaign however, valuable experience was gained with Hurricanes of RAF No. 46 Squadron, as the aircraft proved that using it on a carrier was possible during the Squadrons transfer to Norway. A solution was needed.[2]
