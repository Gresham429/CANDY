Description of Spitfire_Mk_IIb: 
In 1939, a trial was undertaken in which a Spitfire Mk I was fitted with a new 1,175-hp Merlin XII engine, the success of which resulted in the designation of a new variant: the Spitfire Mk II. Other improvements included a new, more efficient cooling system, and a move away from the previous external electric engine starting systems. The Mk IIb variant in particular was fitted with the "B-type" wing, a modification of the A-type wing of the Mk Ia and Mk IIa replacing the inner .303 machine guns with 20 mm Hispano cannons. Spitfire Mk IIs were rapidly manufactured and delivered, replacing all Mk Is in active service by April 1941.
