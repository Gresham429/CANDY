Usage of Hurricane_Mk_I/L: 
The strong, sturdy wings on the Hurricane make for an excellent gun platform for pilots. So whilst it may lack the punch of cannons or heavier machine guns, you will find the Hurricane's agility and ability to put accurate fire on targets to be in your favour. The standard "Hawker" style wide track landing gear present on most, if not all of their monoplane fighters is, of course, found on the Hurricane Mk I/L as well, making this aircraft much more appealing to newer players when landing due to its stability.
