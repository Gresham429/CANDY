Description of Catalina_Mk_IIIa_(Great_Britain): 
The Consolidated PBY Catalina was a twin-engined, multirole flying boat which was employed primarily as a maritime patrol aircraft. A development of Consolidated's P2Y flying boat. One of the most important changes was the introduction two 1,000 hp Twin Wasp engines. The Catalina I entered service with Nos.209 and 240 Squadrons of RAF Coastal Command in 1941. A popular and capable aircraft, orders were also secured for Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. In the hands of Coastal Command crews, the Catalina proved to be an effective and much feared U-boat killer. The Catalina Mk IVa was the British designation for the PBY-5 variant; powered by two 1,200 hp Twin Wasps. Much like the Catalina I, it proved to be an excellent patrol aircraft while still retaining a reasonably large payload of up to 4,000 lb.
