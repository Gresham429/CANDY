History of Spitfire_F_Mk_IXc: 
The Spitfire Mk IX was the result of combining the Spitfire Mk V airframe with a Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 (F - fighter variant) , 66 (LF - low altitude fighter variant), or 70 (HF - high altitude fighter variant) engine in order to improve performance. The Spitfire Mk IX was hastily developed as a temporary response to the Focke-Wulf 190 while production of the improved Spitfire Mk VIII airframe was ramping up. Early models of the Spitfire Mk IX were equipped with what was known as the "c" wing. The "c" wing was designed to decrease production cost and time when compared to the "a" and "b" wings while allowing for use of universal armament installation giving it the nomenclature of the universal wing. The "c" wing was capable of equipping 8 Browning .303 machine guns, 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and 4 Browning .303 machine guns, or 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons. The most common configuration was that of 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons and Browning .303 machine guns as equipping the wing with 4 Hispano 20 mm autocannons resulted in technical problems which could cause the guns to malfunction at high altitude.[1] Later models of Mk IX were equipped with the "e" type wing which was a slightly improved version of the "c" type that allowed for the installation of 2 Browning .50 calibre machine guns and 2 Hispano 20 mm autocannons.
