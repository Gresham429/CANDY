History of Canberra_B_Mk_2: 
The Canberra B Mk.2 was created in 1949 to replace the Mosquito fast bomber. It was designed to have outstanding high altitude performance and speed, being unparalleled for 10 years. Despite the RAF originally  expecting the Canberra to be obsolete within a few years of entering service, so much so that work to develop a replacement (eventually leading to the TSR-2) was started before it had even entered service, it would go on to be one of the RAF's longest serving aircraft. The Canberra remained in front line service with the RAF until its retirement in 2006, some 55 years after it first entered service (although it spent a lot of that time in the photo-reconnaissance role, as opposed to its original purpose as a bomber). The Canberra was replaced in the strategic bomber role by the Valiant (and other V-bombers), and in the strike role by the Buccaneer (following the cancellation of the TSR-2 programme). It established a world's highest altitude record of 21,430 m in 1957 and was the first jet-powered aircraft to make a non-stop transatlantic flight.
