Usage of Harrier_GR.1: 
Despite having a weaker engine than other members of the Harrier family, the Harrier GR.1 still possesses exceptional acceleration and rate of climb. Coupled with a decent selection of load-outs (including the extremely powerful SRAAM missiles), and VTOL capability; this makes the Harrier GR.1 a very potent aircraft for both air-to-air combat and ground attack.
