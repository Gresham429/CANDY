Usage of Spitfire_F_Mk_XVIIIe: 
The Spitfire F Mk XVIIIe is nearly identical in playstyle to its predecessor, the Spitfire Mk XIVe. The only major difference between the two vehicles is the latter's ability to carry a larger and more diverse selection of suspended armament. Primarily, the Spitfire is the pinnacle of dogfighting at mid to high altitude. This fighter excels at catching unsuspecting pilots still climbing to altitude and excels in a turning and energy fighting playstyle.
