History of Corsair_F_Mk_II_(Great_Britain): 
The F4U-1A Corsair was based on the F4U-1. In fact, F4U-1A was not an official designation, but was assigned to mid-to-late production F4U-1s in order to distinguish them from early production F4U-1s postwar. The F4U-1A incorporated a simplified windscreen, and a taller, wider, two frame canopy. The pilots seat was also raised 7 in. All of these modifications increased visibility, especially over the long nose of the plane. A 6 in stall strip was also added to the right wing, outboard of the guns, allowing the wings to stall at the same speed. And, the landing gear oleo struts were improved. These changes combined lead to the clearing of the Corsair for carrier-based operations. In British service, the F4U-1A was known as the Corsair Mk II. They were modified slightly from the American design, and had their wings "clipped", meaning they had 8 in cut off of the wing tips, in order to allow them to fit on British aircraft carriers.
