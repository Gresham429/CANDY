The development of the Hornet was a private venture of the company rather than a contract or an interest of the military in the concept. The development of the Hornet started after 1941 and concentrated in producing a long range fighter, this was designated DH.103. The aircraft was meant to be operated against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific Theatre.
