Usage of DB-7_(Great_Britain): 
The DB-7 is a very fast aircraft for its rank, as it can outrun most aircraft it faces in level flight. The DB-7 has four 7.5 mm light machine guns in the nose that are fixed and controlled by the pilot. Two additional guns are located in turrets facing the rear, one above and one below the fuselage. The upper turret has better coverage than the lower one. Although the defensive armament may seem underwhelming, they are more than capable of dealing with planes of a lower BR. They can still be made to work against higher BR planes if AP-T or AP belts are used. As always, one should aim for the pursuer's engine.
