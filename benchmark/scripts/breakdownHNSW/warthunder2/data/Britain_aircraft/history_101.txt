History of Meteor_F_Mk_3: 
The Gloster Meteor F Mk 3 was the first version of the Meteor to be produced in large numbers, the Mk 3 was significantly heavier than the previous versions of the Meteor, however, it also improved the performance dramatically, the first prototype for the Mk 3 specification (DG209) first flew on the 18th April 1944 and immediately demonstrated its performance improvement by reaching 465 mph (748 km/h) at 16,000 ft, this demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the Meteor Mk 1. The initial 15 aircraft of Mk 3 production were fitted with earlier Rolls Royce W.2B/23c Welland powerplant which was carried over from the Meteor Mk 1, these first 15 airframes of course had reduced performance due to these earlier powerplants being used, shortly after production started the Rolls-Royce Derwent I powerplant became available, this engine increased the power to 2,000 lb of thrust per engine, this was the most common powerplant for the Mk 3, although later in the production run examples were fitted with the later Derwent IV engine which increased thrust to 2,400 lb per engine, giving yet another performance improvement. The final 15 production models were fitted with extended engine nacelles in common with those developed for the later Meteor Mk 4, these increased the performance of the aircraft yet again, this would mark the final major modification to the Mk 3 design before the Meteor Mk 4 would begin production.
