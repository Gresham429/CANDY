Description of Spitfire_Mk_IIa: 
In 1939, a trial was undertaken in which a Spitfire Mk I was fitted with a new 1,175-hp Merlin XII engine, the success of which resulted in the designation of a new variant: the Spitfire Mk II. Other improvements included a new, more efficient cooling system, and a move away from the previous external electric engine starting systems. The Mk IIa variant in particular was fitted with the "A-type" wing, allowing an armament of 8 Browning .303 machine guns, much like the preceding Mk Ia. Spitfire Mk IIs were rapidly manufactured and delivered, replacing all Mk Is in active service by April 1941.
