Usage of Spitfire_F_Mk_XVI: 
The Spitfire F Mk XVI is quite unique with its clipped wings. These give this version of the Spitfire a distinct advantage in roll rate, dive performance, and level top speed. However, they reduce the plane's ability to turn, and unlike other Merlin Spitfires this one is only average in its turning ability. Thankfully, it retains a good climb rate, even if it is not as high as that of the unclipped Spitfire variants. In addition, the clipped wings reduce lift at high altitudes, so performance is best when closer to sea level.
