History of Lancaster_B_Mk_III: 
The Lancaster B Mk 3 was made simultaneously with the Lancaster B Mk 1, and their exteriors are virtually indistinguishable from each other. However, this variant had Packard-built Merlin engines. These engines used Bendix-Stromberg pressure-injection carburettors, which meant the plane had to have different engine cut-off switches in the cockpit.
