History of Buccaneer_S.2: 
The Blackburn Buccaneer was a response to the threatening expansion the Soviet Navy was having at the time. This expansion was the main menace to ships in the Atlantic, especially merchant ships. Thus, the British MoD opted to utilize their already existing naval weaponry and not make a new fleet to counter this expansion. In 1952, the preliminary requirements were set out: a carrier based two-seat jet with maximum speed of 550 knots and combat range of 400 nautical miles, able to carry 8,000 lb of both conventional weaponry and special weaponry such as the Red Beard free-fall nuclear bomb and the Green Cheese anti-ship missile. First responses were made in 1953 and the first prototyping of the Buccaneer was made. It was codenamed BNA (Blackburn Naval Aircraft) or BANA (Blackburn Advanced Naval Aircraft) which lead to the nickname "Banana jet". The first flight of the prototype was made in 1958. This turned into a successful aircraft and was produced under the name of Buccaneer S.1 and served with the FAA in 1963. It was powered by a pair of de Havilland Gyron Junior turbojets. Despite the success of the aircraft, the thrust generated by these engines was lacklustre and failed to achieve the required lift in order to carry the aircraft with full armament and fuel load. This could be resolved by taking the required amount of fuel needed to rendezvous with an aerial refuelling aircraft. While being a solution, it was inefficient as the low thrust generated by both engines while depending on lift blow marked a serious danger.
