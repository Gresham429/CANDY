Description of Beaufighter_Mk_I_(40-mm): 
In the Summer of 1941, engineers were evaluating the use of a 40 mm cannon for aircraft use. Two designs were in consideration, the Vickers S and Rolls-Royce BH. To test these cannons, a Beaufighter Mk.I prototype was modified to have the cannons installed in place of its usual 20 mm autocannons. The results of the test went on to select the Vickers S 40 mm cannon for follow up development, which also saw use in the Hurricane Mk IV.
