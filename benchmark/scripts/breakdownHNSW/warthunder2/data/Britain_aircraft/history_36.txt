History of Sunderland_Mk_V: 
The Short S.25 Sunderland is a British designed & built flying boat, designed primarily to fulfill the role of a patrol bomber, the Sunderland was used primarily by the RAF, but also saw use with the French Navy, RAAF & SAAF just to name a few. The Mark V version of the Sunderland was initially developed due to concerns that the aircraft was underpowered, due to this the Bristol Pegasus engines used on previous models were replaced by Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp (S3C4-G) engines, these new engines offered a considerable power increase while also not causing any reductions in range or flight time, a particular benefit of the new power plant was that the Mark V could remain airborne after 2 of its 4 engines failed, this greatly improved the aircraft's survivability in comparison to earlier versions. A total of 155 Mark V airframes were produced with an additional 33 earlier Mark III's converted to Mark V standard with the updated engines.
