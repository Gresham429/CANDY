Description of Phantom_FG.1: 
By the late 1950s, the Fleet Air Arm were looking to replace their roster of ageing de Havilland Sea Vixens. Having dropped the idea of a navalised version of the P.1154 (a supersonic development of the P.1127, which was itself the predecessor of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier), they instead decided to purchase a customised variant of the F-4 Phantom II from the United States. The Phantom FG.1, also known as the F-4K, was created from the F-4J with a number of modifications, including a hingeable nose radome and longer front gear leg to adapt it to the smaller British carriers, as well as the installation of the larger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines. From April 1968, 48 aircraft would be delivered to the Fleet Air Arm; however, issues would soon be encountered, namely in that the heat produced by the afterburning Spey engines would cause the flight deck plating to buckle and melt. Ultimately, only HMS Ark Royal (R09) would be refitted to operate the Phantom FG.1, carrying 28 aircraft, and they would remain in service until the Ark Royal's decommissioning in 1978, after which the aircraft were transferred to RAF service.
