History of Sea_Fury_FB_11: 
The Sea Fury was the result of Hawkers development of the original Fury biplane fighter, through to the Hurricane, Typhoon and Tempest finally culminating in the second design to be known as the "Fury". Experience with the Tempest and also through research of the Fw 190 lead to a lightweight version of the already successful Tempest II fighter. However, in an age when the skies were quickly being filled with Jet powered aircraft, the Royal Air Force turned down the Hawker Fury as they already have surplus Tempests and were beginning to receive their first jet aircraft. The Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, however, was much more welcoming of a carrier-borne version of the Fury due to the foreseen complications of operating early jet aircraft from Aircraft Carriers. With some Modification to meet Royal Navy specifications, the last and most powerful in the line of British piston engine aircraft was born.
