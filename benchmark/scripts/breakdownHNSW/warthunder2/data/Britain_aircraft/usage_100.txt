Usage of Venom_FB.4: 
The Venom's play style should be a healthy mix of the two dominating ways of flying jet fighters. The Venom is a fast aircraft, and keeping it fast is important in order to keep up with enemies and to have enough energy to sustain manoeuvres - so the Venom is indeed a good high-speed performer. However, it does not best either the MiG-15bis or the F-86F-2 in level flight. Therefore, speed alone cannot be relied on for fighting jets.
