History of Hampden_Mk_I: 
The Handley Page Hampden was the last and fastest twin-engined bomber of the "trio" during the Phoney War. It was designed to meet Air Ministry Specification B.9/32 which called for a faster, heavier, and more powerful bomber that would replace the existing Bristol Blenheim and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The designer, G.V Vokert, designed an interesting prototype, designated HP.52. This plane was originally powered by Napier Sabre Dagger engines, but switched to the more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. Originally the Hampden had two Vickers K gun in ventral and dorsal positions, which proved to be inadequate for daylight defence. This was then switched to two Vickers K guns with modifications. The Hampden had many nicknames, because of the slim, compact and cramped fuselage it was nicknamed the "Flying Suitcase". It was oddly similar in role and appearance to the German fast day-bomber Do 17, which had the nickname "Flying Pencil".
