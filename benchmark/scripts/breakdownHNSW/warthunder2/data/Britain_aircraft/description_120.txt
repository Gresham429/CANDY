Description of Scimitar_F_Mk.1: 
The last aircraft ever produced by the famous Supermarine company, the Scimitar was developed to meet the Royal Navy's requirements for an aircraft with good low-altitude manoeuvrability and wide choice of strike ordnance. Featuring two large Rolls Royce Avon Mk.202 engines, the Scimitar was the heaviest and most powerful aircraft to have been in service with the Fleet Air Arm at its entry in 1958. While the plane was generally praised for its low-level and low-speed flight characteristics, helped in part by a special flap-blowing system that allowed some of the excess thrust to be redirected across the flaps to reduce its stall speed, over half of the 76 Scimitars produced were lost to accidents, and the plane had generally poor reliability and serviceability. The aircraft was quickly relegated to second line duties with the introduction of the Blackburn Buccaneer in 1962, and was finally retired completely in 1970.
