Usage of Blenheim_Mk_IV: 
In order to be successful in shooting down enemy aircraft, one needs to either immediately drop the bomb, or (on small maps like Bastogne, or Essen) dive down, and release on the first target spotted. Then it's just a matter of flying the plane like a Spitfire - turn fighting at low altitude, and sometimes stall fighting, and making all sorts of evasive manoeuvres (though this might seem ridiculous, do not worry, the plane really is capable of supporting such handling). When turning it is important to remember that the plane will rip during sharp turns at speeds exceeding 350 km/h. Obviously, at some point, you will get an enemy on your tail. Then, your defensive gunners come into play. All you need to do is to swing the tail of the aircraft around, and fire at the enemy with either your dorsal or ventral turret. It is also a good idea to first fire off all the ammunition in one of the turrets, and while it is reloading use the second one.
