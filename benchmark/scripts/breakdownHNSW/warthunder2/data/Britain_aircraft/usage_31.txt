Usage of Beaufighter_Mk_VIc: 
The Beaufighter Mk VIc is a heavy fighter with inadequate speed at level flight and poor acceleration. It's big and an easy prey for nimble and fast energy fighters that will likely make passes on it, having only a Vickers K (7.7 mm) as its defensive weaponry with limited field of view from side to side but an excellent view if an enemy engage from high altitude. The Beaufighter has an adequate climb rate for a heavy fighter and can engage bombers with some ease.
