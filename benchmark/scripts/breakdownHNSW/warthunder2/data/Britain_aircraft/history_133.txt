History of Jaguar_IS: 
The Jaguar IS is an Indian variant of the internationally successful SEPECAT Jaguar, which has seen service in as many as six countries, including France, the United Kingdom, India, Oman, Ecuador, and Nigeria. Originally developed as a jet trainer, this ambition was swiftly superseded with the goal of creating an all-weather light strike platform with interdiction capabilities. A joint-venture between France and the United Kingdom, it went on to see service in numerous roles and theatres of conflict including the Gulf War and the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia, where their precision-guided munitions proved crucial to minimising civilian casualties from aerial operations in Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Kosovo, and Herzegovina.
