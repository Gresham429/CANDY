History of Jaguar_GR.1: 
The SEPECAT Jaguar was a joint program between the British and French to develop a cheap subsonic trainer and light attack aircraft. The British and French bought a total of 403 aircraft with Britain receiving 203 of the aircraft. Other exports include to the Indian Air force (160 total aircraft ordered ), The Royal Air force of Oman (26 total aircraft ordered), The Ecuadorian Air force (12 total aircraft ordered) and the air force of Nigeria (18 total aircraft ordered). The Jaguar was used in several military conflicts in countries such as: Mauritania, Chad, Iraq, Bosnia, Pakistan and The Chenepa war but most notably it saw service in the 1990 Gulf War during Operation Desert Storm, where it was used to destroy Iraqi artillery and missile positions. During the Bosnian bombing campaign of 1995 Jaguars of the 41 squadron carried out the first raids in Europe since the second world war. During the Bosnian airstrikes jaguars were fitted with laser designators and would laze Bosnian-Serb forces for RAF Harriers to strike. These re-fitted more modern Jaguars were re-designated as SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 B.
