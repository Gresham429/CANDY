Usage of Jaguar_GR.1: 
As a strike aircraft, the Jaguar GR.1 is well-suited to engaging ground targets with its ability to carry up to eight 1,000 lb bombs and access to a complete ballistics computer allowing it to shine in this role, particularly in ground battles. The aircraft's moderately high speed and good agility allow it to easily manoeuvre near terrain while providing close air support, although the aircraft bleeds considerable energy in turns making it highly unsuitable for air-to-air combat.
