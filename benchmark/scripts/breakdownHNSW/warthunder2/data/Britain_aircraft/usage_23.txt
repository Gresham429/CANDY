Usage of Spitfire_Mk_IIa: 
The Spitfire should climb at the beginning of battle in order to utilise its very good climb rate. It can reliably attain an altitude advantage over the enemy, which allows the pilot to pick and choose which engagements they wish to take part in but you should not fight enemies while on high altitude as engine performance is terrible over certain one.
