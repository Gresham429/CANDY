Usage of Wellington_Mk_III: 
In Air Battles, the winning tactic is to climb high and bomb your targets. If you don't want to climb the Wellington Mk III, is a great low flying bomber, offering great speed and manoeuvrability. However, it lacks any armour and only offers limited protection with turrets in the front, side and rear. It lacks armour plates, unlike other bombers of the other nations. A few well placed shots will see Wellington Mk III, getting torn apart to any aircraft which drop down to engage it from the top or belly. However, its rear gun turret offers four 7.7 mm machine guns which are able to shoot down the enemy aircraft with a few well placed shots.
