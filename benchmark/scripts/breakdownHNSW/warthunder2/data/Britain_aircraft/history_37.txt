History of Wellington_Mk_Ic: 
Developed from the British Air Ministry's Specification B.9/32 in 1932, which called for a long range, twin-engine bomber capable of a range of 720 miles with a payload of 1,000 lbs, Vickers returned to the Ministry with a proposal for an aircraft with four times the range and bombload of the specification. Unsurprisingly, the Ministry ordered a prototype, designated the Vickers Type 271, which took off on its maiden flight on June 15, 1936 with Vickers Chief Test Pilot Joseph "Mutt" Summers at the controls. The aircraft, a mid-wing monoplane fitted with Bristol's Pegasus X engines outputting 915 HP each which drove a three-bladed, variable pitch propeller.
