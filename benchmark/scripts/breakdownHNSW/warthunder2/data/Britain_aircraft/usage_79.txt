Usage of Spitfire_F_Mk_XIVe: 
The Spitfire F Mk XIVe, being outfitted with a Griffon engine, does not have as stellar of a climb rate as its Merlin engine counterparts. However, it still does have a very competitive rate of climb, and can usually come out above all but a few opponents. With such an altitude advantage, the pilot is able to choose which engagements to pursue, and the ability to choose engagements wisely is necessary. Since dogfighting in the Spitfire can involve prolonged turn-fights, make sure that no other enemies are nearby, or that if there are, that they can be dealt with by teammates. This plane's engines gives it great acceleration, and it also accelerates well in dives. Be careful though, since at very high speeds, sharp maneuvers may cause the wings to snap.
