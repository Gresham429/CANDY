Description of Spitfire_Mk.IIa_Venture_I: 
As a method to raise funds for the war effort, a scheme was created that allowed individuals, businesses, and communities to pay to have an aircraft inscribed with a particular name (known as the "Spitfire Fund"). These special aircraft would later become known as "Presentation Spitfires". One such Spitfire (P7923) was dubbed "Venture I". Built in Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory as a Mk IIa (thus equipped with a Merlin XII engine and 8 Browning machine guns) and entered into service on 1st February 1941, the aircraft was initially attached to the RAuxAF 610 Squadron (encoded "DW-H"), before being transferred to the RCAF 411 Squadron (encoded "DB-R"), based at RAF Digby, in July of the same year. In November 1942, the aircraft was sent to the Central Gunnery School at RAF Sutton Bridge, where it later collided with a stationary Miles Master trainer during taxi in February 1944 and was finally written off on 9th November 1944.
