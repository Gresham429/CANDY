History of Boomerang_Mk_I_(Great_Britain): 
The Boomerang Mk I is the first variant of the CAC Boomerang, a fighter aircraft developed by Australia's Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). Designed to equip the RAAF after the start of the Second World War, the aircraft was the first indigenously-built Australian fighter aircraft. The Boomerang was very underpowered due to the limited engine choices, meaning that it was considerably slower than its contemporaries. The aircraft saw limited active service during the Second World War in both frontline and secondary duties.
