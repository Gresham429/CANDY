Usage of Hurricane_Mk_IIB/Trop: 
The twelve machine guns can be very deadly against planes at this rank, spewing what becomes a massive wall of lead toward enemy pilots, as long as the pilot gets into a fairly close range of their target (100 - 250 m is optimal) and firing at gun convergence. However, the twelve guns can burn through ammo fairly quickly, which can lead to constant reload in Arcade Battles and ammunition depletion in Realistic and Simulator Battles if the pilot doesn't manage his fire.
