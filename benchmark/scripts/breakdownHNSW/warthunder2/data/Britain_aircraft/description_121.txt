Description of Jaguar_GR.1: 
The Jaguar GR.1 was developed from the SEPECAT Jaguar, a joint project between Britain and France in the 1960s and 1970s. The Jaguar was originally designed as a trainer and light attack aircraft but later evolved into a supersonic strike aircraft with precise strike capability. It entered service with the Royal Air Force in 1974. It was also exported to India, Oman, Ecuador, and Nigeria. The Jaguar saw combat in several conflicts, such as the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the Kargil War. It remained in service with the RAF until 2007, when it was replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon.
