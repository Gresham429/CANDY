History of Hurricane_Mk_IV: 
The Hawker Hurricane Mk IV was the last major production modification of the Hurricane series. The main feature was a new wing design, which could mount eight RP-3 rockets or two 40 mm Vickers S guns for attacking ground targets. The Hurricane Mk IV may have been equipped with more powerful Merlin 24 or 27 engines, but it is disputed. The Mk IV Hurricane received an additional 350 lb (159 kg) of armour protection for the pilot, radiator, and fuel tanks. A dust filter was added for operation in desert environments.
