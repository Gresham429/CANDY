Usage of Meteor_F_Mk_4_G.41F: 
The Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F flies very similarly to the Sea Meteor F Mk 3, maintaining the Sea Meteor's good acceleration, speed and climb rate. Flying the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F feels a lot like flying the Sea Meteor and two should be played in the much the same way. Where the Meteor F Mk 4 G.41F excels over the sea meteor is in high speed flight , the wing ripping speed has been substantially improved, a high speed handling is better. The wings are also stronger, so while you do still have to be careful at higher speeds you can feel more confident in your manoeuvres than in the Sea Meteor.
