Description of Attacker_FB.2: 
Following the acceptance of the Attacker aircraft into the Fleet Air Arm in August 1951, changes followed along to improve the aircraft. First was the Attacker FB 1, which added pylon under the wings to mount ordnance. Next along was the Attacker FB.2, which saw the use of a new Rolls-Royce Nene engine among other redesigns. 84 units of the Attacker FB.2 would be produced. However, as the first of its kind, the Attacker was soon outpaced by more powerful jet engine designs and was quickly replaced by 1954.
