Usage of Mustang_Mk_IA_(Great_Britain): 
The Mustang Mk-1A is similar to its bigger brother (or in some ways smaller) in the fact that it carries many good and bad traits. Interestingly, it inherits much of the advantages of the P-51D while adding some of its own good characteristics. High altitude performance is miserable, but it won't get there any time soon with the sluggish climb rate. Top speed is very good, yet achieving it can take some time due to the slow acceleration. Low-altitude manoeuvrability is decent.
