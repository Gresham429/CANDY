Usage of Sea_Hawk_FGA.6: 
In Air Realistic battles, you have a good top speed with okay acceleration and a decent climb rate (particularly when fully upgraded). After takeoff, build speed to about 500 km/h then enter a 10 degree climb (a 10 degree climb straight off the runway can also work in some situations). You can either continue climbing to high altitude (~5 km) to engage high flying bombers /fighters and gain an altitude advantage; or you can choose to level off at 3-4 km and focus on building speed to engage enemy fighters and bombers at lower altitudes (aircraft such as Ar 234 C-3s and IL-28s will often fly low to get to bases/ground targets quickly) depending on your preferred playstyle.
