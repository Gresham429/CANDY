Usage of Spitfire_Mk_Ia: 
It is recommended to climb at the start of the match, using the Spitfire Mk Ia's excellent climb rate. This can be done efficiently in two ways depending on the preference of the pilot. If you want to get to high altitudes quickly without having covered much distance you can start off with a 26 degree climb until around 4 km (circa 13,000 ft), after which the nose of the aircraft can be lowered down to a 20 degree climb. If you want to get to a higher altitude at a more moderate tempo and cover more distance, the preference is then to climb steadily the entire way up at 20 degrees. The advantage of the first strategy is that you are going to be the highest altitude fighter in the game. The advantage of the second strategy is that you will be ahead of your bases and at the altitude of enemy bombers so that you can take easy head-on passes at them. In those situations, the bombers can be easy kills (if you fail a head-on against a bomber it is not recommended to turn around and attempt to finish off the bomber as the tail, ventral, dorsal and beam gunners would then have the advantage of you flying into their bullets).
