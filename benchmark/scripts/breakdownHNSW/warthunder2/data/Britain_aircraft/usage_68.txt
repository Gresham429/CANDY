Usage of Halifax_B_Mk_IIIa: 
The Halifax Mark IIIa is the first true "heavy" bomber that an Allied player will unlock. It has four engines that do well at higher altitudes- above the height of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) - and it has a large payload of around 12,000 pounds of bombs, going by weight. This is sufficient so that one Halifax can, on their own, annihilate all three minibases in a match and take a small chunk out of the enemy airfield, and otherwise, it can take a sizeable chunk out of the airfield- around three-quarters of the base's total HP. Two Halifaxes can annihilate all the bases and most of the airfield together in its BR bracket. Three Halifaxes can destroy everything in an uptier. Four Halifaxes, should they survive the trip to the enemy bases, can destroy everything they see on the map and result in a fast game-over. It dwarfs the payloads of contemporary 4.0 bombers, such as the Pe-2-83, B-25J-1, and the Yer-2 (M-105) with its overwhelmingly large bombload.
