Usage of Brigand_B_1: 
In AB and RB, you should immediately bomber hunt, as those will be your easiest kills, combined with your bomber altitude, you should stay high until you run out of targets to engage then you should go for fighters, before ground targets when it is safe to do so. When diving, use your airbrakes to be sure not to exceed your maximum speed of 680kph in a dive. Exceeding 550kph, sustaining a flick roll and other sharp acrobatics may break your wings.
