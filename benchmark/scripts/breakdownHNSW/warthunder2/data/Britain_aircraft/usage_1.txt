Usage of Fury_Mk_I: 
If you want to use the Fury, the best advice is to side climb a bit at the start of the match so you at least have some energy to work with. Plan manoeuvres ahead and go for easy targets such as inattentive planes and attackers destroying ground vehicles. Most of the problems with the plane are mitigated in Arcade Battles as traits like engine overheating and wing rip-offs are not modelled in that mode.
