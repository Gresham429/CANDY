History of Wyvern_S4: 
The Wyvern was one of the few turboprop combat aircraft ever fully developed, and entered service long after World War II had ended. The design was a relic of an era past, with jet-powered aircraft now replacing propeller aircraft. It also suffered from a long development period, beginning in 1944 as the P.10. This lead to the Wyvern seeing very little combat use and being quickly retired. The Wyvern S.4 variant contained an Armstrong Siddeley Python 3 turboprop engine, able to output 3670 horsepower, and was the first and only variant of the Wyvern to enter service with the British Royal Navy.
