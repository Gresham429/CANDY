History of Meteor_F_Mk.8_Reaper: 
With the appearance of the Meteor F.8 (Type G.41K) in 1949, which offered an overall improved performance over the earlier F.4 variant, a number of studies were launched aimed at increasing the versatility of the Meteor. One obvious path given the type's improved performance and stability as a gun platform was that of a dedicated ground attack platform, the so-called Ground Attack Fighter (GAF, or G.44), which was started as a private venture by Gloster.
