Usage of D.520_(Great_Britain): 
The main purpose of the D.520 is the role of an interceptor/fighter. It has no suspended armament capability and thus is limited to aerial combat. In this respect, there are a few things to consider, first and foremost that this is a fighter that does not do great away from a squad. It has mediocre flight characteristics as far as speed, climb and turn are concerned. It is however quite well armoured to compensate for such, meaning that it will stay airworthy where other aircraft would crash, and instead stands a fighter which is effective in engagements where it has support to rely on. Without such support, it is a very situational plane which can engage certain enemies depending on advantage in altitude, speed, or sometimes even a turning radius. It has a respectable armament of one powerful Hispano 20 mm cannon with a very limited ammunition load (60 rounds), and four 7.5 mm machine guns with a good deal of ammunition which makes it competitive in realistic battles. Its strong airframe is able to withstand significant wind resistance making it potent in a longer dive. Despite its limited attributes, it handles fairly comfortably and thus can be a real asset to a pilot which employs situational awareness combined with an in-depth understanding of the enemy aircraft he will choose to either engage or avoid. It has a potent incendiary tracer round for its machine guns and the Hispano makes it pack a fairly significant punch despite its limited cannon ammunition. The D.520 is best considered a heavier single-seat fighter aircraft which can out-endure other enemy squads due to its armour, but not outturn, outrun, outgun many other types of aircraft at its own rank.
