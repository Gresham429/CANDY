Description of Spitfire_F_Mk_IXc: 
The superiority of the Fw 190 over the Spitfire Mk V quickly became apparent after its introduction in late 1941. While a new engine, the Merlin 61, with a two-stage supercharger had been developed, a new airframe for high-altitude operations was still in the works; thus, as an interim measure, the new engine was fitted into the Spitfire Mk Vc, producing the Spitfire Mk IX. Even without the aerodynamic and structural improvements of the new design, the Mk IX was found to be an effective counter to the Fw 190, with much greater speed, climb rate, and high-altitude manoeuvrability than the Mk V, while matching its low-level performance. Many Mk Vc's would be converted to the new standard, and were armed in both all-cannon and B-type wing-style arrangements, but with the advantage of greater ammunition capacity due to the belt-feeding of the cannons facilitated by the wing redesign. In early 1943, the Merlin 61 engines were gradually replaced by the Merlin 63, and production of the Spitfire F Mk IX was finally halted in late 1943 in favour of the Merlin 66-powered LF Mk IX.
