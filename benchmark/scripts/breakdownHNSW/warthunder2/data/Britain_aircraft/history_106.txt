History of Attacker_FB_1: 
The Attacker was part of the first generation of jet aircraft to enter service with the Royal Navy and had the distinction of being the first operational combat jet on a British carrier. Whilst the Royal Air Force was already equipped with Meteors and Vampires, the Fleet Air Arm fell behind due to the difficulty of operating such a radical new technology from the Navy's existing carriers. This was partially the reasoning the FAA showed interest in the Sea Fury and the later Griffon Seafires as a "make-do" solution.
