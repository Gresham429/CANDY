Usage of Seafire_LF_Mk.III: 
The Seafire LF Mk.III should be played as a turnfighter with a good climb rate. Use the plane's good climb rate to get to around 4,000 m and attack low-flying or otherwise disadvantaged opponents. Attacking bombers is not recommended, as you have little ammunition and your offensive armament is not powerful enough to take out bombers before their defensive armament takes you out. Conserve your energy so you can stay manoeuvrable: it is recommended to build up speed in a straight line after reaching altitude.
