Description of Swift_F.7: 
Following the failure of the Swift F.1, a number of upgrades were made, including the installation of afterburn-capable engines, structural modifications, and a longer nose to accommodate cameras and a more powerful radar. The variants culminated in the Swift F.7, notably the first and only Swift to be fitted with guided air-to-air missiles, namely the Fireflash. However, despite having resolved most of the issues plaguing the Swift line, the F.7 never entered service, having been made redundant by the Hawker Hunter, and the 14 built aircraft were relegated to training purposes and trialling of the Fireflash.
