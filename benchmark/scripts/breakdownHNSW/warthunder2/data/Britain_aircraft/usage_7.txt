Usage of Nimrod_Mk_II: 
Piloting the Nimrod Mk II will be relatively the same regardless of the game mode (AB, RB or SB.) The Nimrod is a pure fighter craft and is not capable of carrying any strike armaments and its ability to provide CAS is limited to opportune gun runs on vehicles with open tops or no armour whatsoever.
