Usage of Tempest_Mk_V_(Vickers_P): 
This plane with its two 47 mm cannons on each side with only armour-piercing ammo (by default) with no other armament is clearly made for the ground attack role. It's definitely not a turn fighter, as the plane is not designed to manoeuvre well, and the price of missing a high calibre shot is way too high, but once fully modified the plane has the ability to be the most unstoppable force in its role.
