Usage of Mosquito_FB_Mk_XVIII: 
When used in Arcade Battles (AB), it is often best to find lone targets away from the main activity due to it's more specialized armament. Like the Mk.VI before it, the Mk.XVIII has no defensive armament; even a well-flown bomber may take you out. The 6-pdr can take out all three kinds of tanks (light, medium and heavy) as well as light pillboxes, the latter being the easiest as they are stationary. Line up your gun sights, aim centre and fire. The distance you fire from is up to personal preference, but a good starting point is 600 m. Light tanks can be taken care of from any angle and medium tanks can be dealt with from the sides and rear, but aiming at their front may cause bounces and is not a guaranteed kill. Heavy tanks are like medium, but a frontal attack is most certainly going to bounce this time. Don't forget that the tanks will be actively moving, which means that you will have to correct for horizontal accuracy as well. A good way to practice this is to jump into a custom game and practice on people driving tanks, as they can be harder to hit then a AI controlled vehicle.
