Usage of Sunderland_Mk_IIIa: 
Side climbing is essential for the Sunderland Mk IIIa as, whilst it is a very rugged aircraft, the combination of slow climb rate and large bright (white) airframe makes you a very obvious target, meaning that you won't be flying for very long and find upgrading a real chore.
