Usage of Hudson_Mk_V_(Great_Britain): 
The Hudson excels in ground attacking with its respectable payload of bombs, rockets and dual-mounted 7.7 mm - meaning it has a lot of firepower to throw at the ground units. It can also be used as a designated bomber, having a load big enough to take out one base and damage another. However in RB, you may find the Hudson to be best for bomber hunting and keeping the enemy fighters down as its fairly fast and manoeuvrable. To take on bombers, it is advisable to position yourself in front of or below an enemy bomber (wherever their firepower is weak) as the Hudson has no armour to protect the pilot. You can then light them up with the dual-mounted Browning 7.7s on the dorsal turret, which has a full 360Â° field of view and good elevation. Use AP belts to compensate for the relatively low calibre of the armament.
