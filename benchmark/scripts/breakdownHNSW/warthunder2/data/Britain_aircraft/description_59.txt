Description of Spitfire_Mk_Vc/trop: 
In order to adapt the Spitfire Mk Vc for overseas operations, such as in Malta, North Africa, Burma, and Australia, the aircraft was equipped with a large air filter under the nose, as well as other modifications such as a larger oil coolant tank and survival gear behind the pilot's seat. The restricted airflow to the supercharger reduced the performance of the engine, but this was deemed acceptable. A naval camouflage was also applied to better protect the aircraft while flying over the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean.
