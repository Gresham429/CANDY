History of Wellington_Mk_X: 
Performance-wise the Wellington was not notably remarkable, its strength lay on the inside. Devised by one of the greatest innovative thinkers in history, Sir Barnes Neville Wallis devised a geodesic structure resulting in an exceptionally strong airframe. Together with Reginald Kirshaw "Rex" Pierson, they designed their record-making "Vickers Wellesley", paving the way for the "Wellington" and larger "Warwick".
