Usage of Sunderland_Mk_V: 
After unloading your ordnance, it's best to return to base (or wait for reload in arcade battles) and get another load. In RB/SB, taking note from the "Flight Performance" section, land appropriately and continue the fight at a lower altitude to get back quickly for another bomb drop.
