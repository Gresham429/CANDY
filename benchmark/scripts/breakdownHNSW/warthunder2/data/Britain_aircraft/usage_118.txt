Usage of Javelin_F.(A.W.)_Mk.9: 
As an aircraft the Javelin has many flaws and has picked up a fairly poor reputation, but once you get used to its quirks you can work around them and the Javelin can become an effective aircraft, which you can do well in. The Javelin's key advantage is its dual afterburning engines which give it good acceleration and very good climb rate; it can (at lower altitudes) accelerate past 600 km/h in a 20° climb without issue. As the Javelin has a fairly poor top speed (at least compared to some of the vehicles you can face), you will want to make use of the powerful engines and climb to a reasonable attitude quickly at the start of the match. In terms of climb profile your options are to either throw the Javelin in to a 10 - 20° climb straight off the runway, or build your speed (up to around 700 km/h), then enter the same sort of angle climb; the first option will get you to altitude in less distance, but you likely will not have much speed when you get there, on maps with room for it building speed first will give you more options. Your target altitude will vary depending on the situation, but typically you will want to be at at least 4,000 m, sometimes closer to 6,000 m on larger maps. Ultimately if an enemy fighter is above you in the Javelin and decides to dive on you, you're in for a bad time, you will likely not have the speed to out-run them in this scenario, and the Javelin's large size and somewhat lacking flight characteristics can make evasion tricky (and lead to you losing lots of energy); by climbing to a suitable altitude (depending on what the other team are doing) you can minimise the risk of this situation occurring.
