Description of Vampire_F.B.5: 
The de Havilland Vampire began in 1941 as a very experimental aircraft, designed around de Havilland's newly developed turbojet engine, the Halford H.1 (later renamed the de Havilland Goblin). It emerged just as turbojets were becoming powerful enough to power single-engined aircraft, aided by the Vampire's unusual twin-boom design, which allowed a shorter tail pipe to be fitted and thus reduced power loss from the engine. The prototype first flew in September 1943, only 6 months after the Gloster Meteor, and production began in May 1944, although the first units would not enter service until 1946. The Vampire FB.5 was introduced in 1948, featuring armour around the engine, clipped wings, and hardpoints for bombs and rockets, allowing it to undertake the fighter-bomber role. It was the most produced variant of the Vampire, with over 1,000 units built.
