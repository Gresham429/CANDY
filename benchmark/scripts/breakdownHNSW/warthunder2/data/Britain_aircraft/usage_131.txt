Usage of Jaguar_GR.1A: 
The Jaguar is mostly a strike aircraft with defensive capabilities against aircraft. The role of the Jaguar is pretty straightforward when it comes to air battles: base bombing or ground/naval units bombing. It is recommended to utilize the different bomb payloads combined with flares and the AIM-9G. Rockets are not recommended to be taken as they are inaccurate and useless against lightly armoured vehicles, even with the ballistic computer. GBUs are the main weapon against any vessel. They are recommended to be used against destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and even enemy carriers. A well-placed Mk.13 is enough to sink a carrier.
