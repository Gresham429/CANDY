History of Swordfish_Mk_I: 
Affectionately known as the "Stringbag" by the pilots, engineers and crews who operated her, the Fairey Aviation Company's Swordfish was a design that was outdated from the very beginning of the Second World War. Despite this, it managed to outlive its replacements, including the Fairey Albacore, in service until the arrival of modern monoplane Torpedo Bombers such as the Fairey Barracuda. Seeing 4 models, plus a float plane modification, the Swordfish would finally bow out of service in 1945 after VE day after showing just how successful the outdated design had become. From the Battle of Taranto, Operations in the Atlantic, to the attack on the Bismarck, the Swordfish struggled on to the end.
