History of Stirling_B_Mk_I: 
Designed in the late 1930s by the Short Brothers, the design of what would be the Stirling met the demands of the British Air Ministry, which in 1936 called for the need of a long range, high speed, four engine bomber as described by Specification B.12/36, which would go from design to manufacturing in a short period of time.
