Description of Attacker_FB_1: 
As an attempt to replace the Spitfire, Supermarine created the Spiteful fighter with redesigned wings and undercarriage. However, with the advent of jet engine development, piston-engined aircraft were beginning to be overlooked for better performing aircraft. To save the project, Supermarine offered to convert the aircraft into a jet-powered version and also adapting it for the Royal Navy, who were also looking for a new jet-powered aircraft. Following successful redesign and testing, the new jet was accepted into production as the Attacker. Originally designed as a fighter with designation Attacker F 1, 11 of the last production units were converted into a fighter-bomber version designated Attacker FB 1.
