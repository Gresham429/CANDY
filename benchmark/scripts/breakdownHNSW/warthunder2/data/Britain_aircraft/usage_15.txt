Usage of Tuck%27s_Gladiator_Mk_II: 
Try to avoid enemy monoplanes if you are at an altitude disadvantage since you will bleed a lot of speed in combat. Instead, begin climbing up to 2,000 - 3,500 m and only attempt to assault enemy aircraft when they are flying below you and are alone. Another reason to fly high is the engine temperature. When diving, turn your engine off ('I' key by default) which will not only prevent the engine over-revving, but also cool your engine rapidly and fly silently, making the enemy unaware of your presence.
