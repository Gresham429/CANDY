History of Fury_Mk_I: 
The first prototype of the Fury (initially named the Hawker Hornet) was presented to the UK in 1927. In March 1931, after being renamed into the Hawker Fury, the biplane made its maiden flight and entered service with the RAF in May of the same year. The Fury would serve in not only the Royal Air Force, but also with Yugoslavia, Iran, South Africa, and the Spanish, which they used during the Spanish Civil War. While the Fury Mk I did not become a mainstream RAF fighter, Fury pilots were considered elite due to Fury-equipped squadrons such as No.1 squadron participations in gunnery and aerobatic competitions. A total of 117 Fury Mk I fighters were produced.
