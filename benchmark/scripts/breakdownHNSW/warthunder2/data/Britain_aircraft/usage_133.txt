Usage of Jaguar_IS: 
The Jaguar IS is excellent in Air Arcade battles as a fighter. Its excellent manoeuvrability and nose authority grants it an unparalleled edge when compared to enemies. Furthermore, the flight models in Air Arcade better accommodate the quirks of the Jaguar airframe, minimising energy bleed while allowing the aircraft to pull manoeuvres otherwise impossible in other game modes. Unfortunately, the Jaguar IS has only a single 30 mm ADEN Mk.4 cannon, which reduces the likelihood of getting a kill from a glancing blow, increasing the time-to-kill. Luckily, the low velocity of this armament is accommodated by the presence of a lead indicator in this game mode.
