Usage of JAS39C: 
The JAS39C is the crown jewel of the British Aviation tech tree, sitting at one whole Battle Rating above any and all other planes. It is the most capable fighter, ground striker, dogfighter and interceptor out of the British tree, and one of the most capable planes in game, thanks to its amazing manoeuvrability, low speed flight characteristics and suite of ordinance. While it can use a combination of IR missiles, radar missiles, guided bombs and AGMs, it does not feature more than 4 fully customizable hardpoints, along with the 2x AIM-9Ms from the wingtips. this means that you can have one radar missile, one IR missile with Countermeasures pod, one guided bomb and one AGM, ontop of fuel and a LITENING II targetting pod. The ability to take such custom loadouts makes this plane very versatile and suitable for a large number of roles in Air-to-Air combat and Air-to-Ground combat.
