Usage of Lancaster_B_Mk_I: 
The Lancaster carries the heaviest bomb load of any bomber before the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, at a fantastic 14,000 lb (6,363 kg), and the heaviest of any British bomber in the game. It can quickly end games if left to go about its business. The Lancaster also has relatively good performance and agility for a four-engined heavy bomber, significantly better than both the American B-17 and B-24 bombers.
