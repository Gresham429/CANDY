Description of Hunter_F.6: 
The early variants of the Hawker Hunter, the F.1 and F.2, faced significant issues including a lack of range and compressor stalls caused by the nose-mounted armament. These problems were addressed through the development of improved designs, the Avon-engined F.4 and Sapphire-engined F.5, which featured increased fuel capacity and modifications to the armament. These were further developed into the Hunter F.6, which had a larger engine, altered wing design, and increased fuel capacity. The F.6 became the Royal Air Force's frontline fighter until 1963, when it started being replaced by the English Electric Lightning. While Hunters in RAF service never carried any guided air-to-air armament, one Hunter F.6 was used as a testbed for the development of the Hawker Siddeley SRAAM, an alternative to AIM-9B Sidewinder and Firestreak missiles. Although the SRAAM program was eventually canceled, its design work laid the foundation for the AIM-132 ASRAAM.
