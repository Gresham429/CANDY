Usage of Nimrod_Mk_I: 
The Nimrod Mk I has inadequate speed, but makes up for it with an excellent climb rate that will get it above most other biplanes. It is also a highly manoeuvrable. Being slow makes it easy prey to faster fighters, but that's where the manoeuvrability can come in play to avoid being a easy prey for superior fighters and make them bleed their energy.
