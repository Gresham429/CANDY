History of Sea_Hurricane_Mk_IB: 
The Hawker Sea Hurricane Mk IB was the first carrier-capable Hurricane; the previous Mk IA Sea Hurricane was designed only for catapult assisted takeoff, with no means of recovery back onto the ship. The Mk IB featured catapult spools and an arrestor hook. Starting in July of 1941, the Sea Hurricane Mk IB operated from HMS Furious and starting in October 1941 they operated from Merchant aircraft carriers (cargo ships modified with a flight deck). On 31 July 1941, Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron, operating from HMS Furious, shot down a Do 18 flying boat - the first aerial victory of the aircraft. From testing, the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) preferred de Havilland propellers to the Rotol propellers. This was because the heavier Rotol propeller could cause the plane to dip forward and the propeller would hit the carrier deck, while the lighter de Havilland propellers could avoid this issue.
