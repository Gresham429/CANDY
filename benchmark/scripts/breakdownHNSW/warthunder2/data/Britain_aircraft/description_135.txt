Description of Sea_Harrier_FRS.1: 
The Sea Harrier FRS.1 was a specialised version of the Hawker-Siddeley Harrier, designed for naval operations. It joined the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom in 1978 and gained fame for its role in the Falklands War in 1982, where it defended the fleet from enemy aircraft attacks with great success. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Sea Harriers shot down 21 Argentinean planes without losing any of their own, a remarkable accomplishment that demonstrated the superiority of the aircraft. In a subsequent upgrade, the Sea Harrier FRS.1 was equipped with a 2x2 Aim-9L configuration, further enhancing its air combat capabilities.
