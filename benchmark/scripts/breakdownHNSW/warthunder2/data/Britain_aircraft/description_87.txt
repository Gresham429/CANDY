Description of Hornet_Mk.III: 
The DH.103 Hornet was a twin engine fighter developed by the de Havilland Company as a successor to the DH.98 Mosquito. The aircraft was introduced into the RAF at the end of World War II with the intention of being used in the Pacific Theatre against the Japanese Empire. It had notably long range, which was an excellent choice for covering large portions of land and sea in the colonies far from Europe. The aircraft was also used in strike missions during the Malayan Emergency, and it served from 1946-1956. The Hornet Mk.III was the most common variant of the Hornet with a total of 132 built.
