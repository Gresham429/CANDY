History of Firefly_F_Mk_I: 
The Firefly originated as a replacement for both the Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar designs. The tried and tested the concept of having two crew, a pilot and an observer, proved to be effective for long-range missions where the aircraft would be airborne for an extended period of time. However, the origins of this crew composition were far less well thought out as some of its other features; the late inter-war period saw the British Admiralty insist on two crew members for any naval aircraft other than those intended for point defence, as it was felt that the complexities of over-sea navigation were too complicated for a pilot to carry out whilst simultaneously controlling the aircraft. This would, however, limit the performance of the aircraft due to the extra weight and size. First taking to the skies in 1941, the Firefly had an impressive 4 x 20 mm cannons; a massive improvement over the Fulmar's 8 x 0.303 inch (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. The first model was to use a Rolls-Royce Griffon IIB engine that was a significant boost over the Fulmar's Rolls-Royce Merlin.
