History of Brigand_B_1: 
Designed to replace the famous Bristol Beaufighter series, the Bristol Type 164 "Brigand" was based on the already in production Bristol Buckingham, a transport/liaison aircraft intended to have been a medium bomber like the Wellington. Because of this, the Brigand was substantially larger than its predecessor and its performance suffered in suit. Originally conceived as a fast torpedo attacker, the Brigand turned out to be a heavy strike bomber, and only the first eleven airframes were ever torpedo capable.
