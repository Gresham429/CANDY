History of Halifax_B_Mk_IIIa: 
The Handley Page Halifax was an archetypal British heavy bomber, making up nearly half of all that were produced. At the point of its maximum production, its operations enveloped 41 separate factories, 600 subcontractors and 51,000 employees, with one Halifax completed every hour. The peak of its usage saw 76 Halifax-equipped Bomber Command Squadrons. As with the rest of its kind, the Halifax was known for its huge, lumbering profile and punishing bomb load. During its service with Britain, it flew 82,773 operations and dropped 224,207 tons of bombs. A grand total of 6,178 Halifaxes of all variants were built, with 1,833 planes lost.
