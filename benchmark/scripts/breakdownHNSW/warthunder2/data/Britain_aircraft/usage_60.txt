Usage of Spitfire_Mk_Vc: 
The Spitfire Mk Vc does not have as high a climb rate as other Spitfires, but it does make up for this in manoeuvrability and firepower.  Like all Spitfires, this one is a very good at turning with nearly any opponent that it might face. Trying to lure the enemy into extended turnfights is one of the most effective tactics to use in this plane. Thanks to a decent straight-line energy retention, the plane can also boom and zoom fairly well. However, keep in mind that control surfaces do suffer from compression at high speeds. Roll rate is dramatically reduced above 600 km/h, and elevator authority similarly suffers above 700 km/h. This can make it difficult to get guns on target in high-speed boom and zoom runs.
