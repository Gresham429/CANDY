Usage of Beaufort_Mk_VIII: 
When engaging fighters (Yak-7s, Bf 109 Es, Spitfires, P-36s, A5M4 etc...) try to force them onto your tail. The Beaufort's twin rear .50 calibre machine guns tear everything up at this rank. Try to avoid head-ons, as your pilots are prone to be wounded behind that large glass window. If you get an enemy fighter to stay on your tail at wing level, your gunner will show no mercy!
