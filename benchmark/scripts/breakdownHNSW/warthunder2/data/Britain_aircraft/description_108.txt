Description of Sea_Venom_FAW_20: 
Following the development of the de Havilland Venom for the RAF, the Royal Navy also expressed an interest in acquiring the aircraft for its Fleet Air Arm. The twin-seat night-fighter variant NF.2 was modified to be suitable for aircraft carriers, featuring a strengthened undercarriage, folding wings, and tailhook. This first navalised variant was designated the Sea Venom FAW.20, operating as naval interceptors from 1951. It eventually began to be replaced by the de Havilland Sea Vixen in 1959, with the final units withdrawn from second-line service in 1970.
