Description of Spitfire_Mk_Vc: 
The advent of the high-altitude Ju 86 bomber over Britain in late 1940 saw a growing need for a new high-altitude-capable (pressurised) variant of the Spitfire. A stop-gap solution was presented in the Spitfire Mk V, a Mk I airframe fitted with a new Merlin 45 engine, producing 1,440 hp and incorporating a new single-stage supercharger, as well as other improvements including a carburettor able to handle zero-G manoeuvres without fuel flow issues. The Mk Vc in particular was the first variant of the Spitfire to be fitted with the "C-type" or "Universal" wing, heavily redesigned to reduce manufacturing time as well as allowing a wide variety of armament layouts to be equipped without the need for structural modifications. The C-type wing was commonly fitted with an all-cannon loadout of 4 x 20 mm Hispano cannons, which could also be belt-fed in the new wing design, doubling their ammunition capacity compared to those in the B-type wings. With the quick introduction of the Spitfire F Mk IX in order to counter the rising threat of the Fw 190, the Mk Vc saw little combat over Europe. However, Spitfire Mk Vs were commonly operated overseas, resulting in their tropicalised counterparts.
