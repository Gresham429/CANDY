Usage of Sea_Vixen_F.A.W._Mk.2: 
The Red Tops are generally much better missiles to equip, compared to the Firestreaks, as they have the largest warhead of any air-to-air missile in the game and have a slightly better top speed (Mach 2.5). Because of this, the Sea Vixen's best tactic is to climb to one side at the start of the battle and attack enemy bombers. The Red Tops are very good for attacking from the side and this tactic is a good idea to avoid enemy tail gunners and will make the missile more likely to hit because of the Red Tops' poor range from the rear.
