History of Strikemaster_Mk.88: 
The concept of the Strikemaster light attack jet came to fruition after the successful conversion of the Jet Provost trainer aircraft by some foreign operators into a strike aircraft, ready to use in combat against insurgents. The British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) began to equip the aircraft with a more powerful engine, front-facing machine guns, and weapon mounts for export sales, so that even countries with modest economies could afford an inexpensive attack aircraft. The Mk.88 was specifically designed for the New Zealand Air Force â€” with the first aircraft of this modification being delivered in 1972, which remained in service until 1993. The Strikemaster set a world record as the most frequently ordered aircraft for export, and was in service with the air forces of 10 foreign countries!
