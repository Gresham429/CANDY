Usage of Boston_Mk_I_(Great_Britain): 
The Boston is an incredibly fast bomber, being able to outrun everything it will face. The bomb load lacks a bit of punch as it carries the inferior British 500 pound bomb which has much less TNT. Decent defensive firepower means it can defend itself if it has to, but the best defense for the Boston is its cruising speed of 450 km/h to outrun any pursuers.
