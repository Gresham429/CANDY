History of Wirraway_(Great_Britain): 
In 1936, the Royal Australian Air Force began evaluating foreign-designed aircraft for local production and established the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation to oversee production. In 1937, the North American NA-16 "Basic Combat" aircraft was selected as the first "home-built" Australian military aircraft. The NA-16, with some modifications, would go on to see service in the US Army Air Corps as the BC-1 before being re-designated the T-6 Texan (later AT-6 Texan), in the US Navy as the SNJ-1, in the Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force and South African Air Force as the Havard. The NA-16 was used as a Trainer and as a "Hack", a second-line plane used for courier and transport duties, by air forces around the world.
