History of Hunter_F.6: 
When the Avon-engined Hawker Hunter F.1 and the Sapphire-engined Hawker Hunter F.2 entered service in 1954, it soon became apparent that the initial variants suffered a number of issues, the most important of which was its general lack of range. Flying on internal fuel supplies only, the aircraft's endurance was limited to about an hour, an issue which became painfully apparent on February 8th 1956 when a flight of 8 Hunters of the Central Fighter Establishment, a Royal Air Force training unit, were unable to land at their assigned base or divert to any suitable other base due to deteriorating weather conditions, with 6 aircraft being lost and one pilot killed in the ensuing confusion. Another important issue with the type was its nose-mounted armament which caused two distinct issues: at higher altitudes - and oddly enough, only on the Avon-engined F.1 variant - the gun exhaust gasses could be ingested by the wingroot air intakes, causing a compressor stall; on both versions, the cannon ammo links, which were ejected from the aircraft, had a tendency to strike the fuselage undersides, causing damage to the surfaces. The original concept of using the flaps as a split airbrake would in turn cause sudden pitch trim changes when deployed. While the latter issue was resolved relatively easily by adding a simple one-piece airbrake underneath the rear fuselage, the flight range and gun firing issues were much more serious, effectively rendering these early variants of the Hunter useless as fighter aircraft.
