Usage of Sea_Gladiator_Mk_I: 
At rank I 
with a battle rating of 1.0 (AB/RB/SB), this plane will typically be one of the first fighters a new player will research. However, the Sea Gladiator, like its land-based cousin, may be difficult to seek success in, especially in Realistic Battles mode. Within RB, when up-tiering comes into play, it will have to deal with not only biplane adversaries such as the CR.42, F3F and the very manoeuvrable Ki-10, but also more advanced fighters such as the P-40E, Bf 109s, I-16s, and Ki-43s. All these plane types have several varying advantages against the Sea Gladiator, which can make early grinding a bit unbearable for some players.
