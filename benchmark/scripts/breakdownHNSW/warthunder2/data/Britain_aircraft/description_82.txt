Description of Spitfire_F_Mk_22: 
The Spitfire F Mk 22 was one of the last models of the famous Supermarine Spitfire. The Mk 22 was derived from the previous Mk 21, differing in lowered rear part of the fuselage and bubble canopy. However, this change led to stability problems, which in turn led to not having a fuselage fuel tank installed. The problem was solved in December 1945 when the entire rear fuselage and tail section of the then-developed Supermarine Spiteful was installed. The RAF initially ordered 627, however the end of war decreased the number to 260. Twenty Spitfires were sold to Egypt, eleven to Rhodesia, and ten to Syria.
