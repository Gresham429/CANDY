Description of Fury_Mk_II: 
The Hawker Fury entered service in 1931 and was the first RAF fighter to exceed 200 mph (320 km/h) in level flight. The Mark II was even faster and both types of Furies remained in service with various air forces right up to the start of WWII. A special version fitted with a Bristol radial engine was built for Iran/Persia, but most 'normal' Furies had a Rolls-Royce Kestrel of 525 hp or 640 hp. Many other versions of the Hawker Fury were made, including the Yugoslav, Persian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Spanish Furies. The Fury Mark II entered service in 1936, remaining with RAF fighter command until January 1939, replaced by other planes such as the Gladiator and Hurricane.
