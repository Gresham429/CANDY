History of Boomerang_Mk_II_(Great_Britain): 
The Boomerang Mk II is the second variant of the CAC Boomerang, a fighter aircraft developed by Australia's Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). Designed to equip the RAAF after the start of the Second World War, it was Australia's first indigenous fighter aircraft. The Boomerang was very underpowered due to the limited choice of engines, meaning that it was considerably slower than its contemporaries. The aircraft saw limited active service during the Second World War in both frontline and secondary duties.
