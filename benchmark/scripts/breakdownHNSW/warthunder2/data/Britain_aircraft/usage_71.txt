Usage of Hellcat_Mk_II_(Great_Britain): 
The Hellcat Mk I is an all-around excellent aircraft, being at home in many roles such as Bomber Hunter, Fighter, and Ground attacker. This plane is especially good in the role of Boom & Zoom, and for its Battle Rating, it can be one of the first aircraft at high altitude, ready to stalk its prey. You can turn-fight with the Hellcat's excellent elevator authority, but it is ill-advised, as aircraft of this battle rating you will encounter such as the La-5, A6M2, Spitfire, and the occasional Yak-3 will out turn you and turn you into Swiss cheese. This aircraft is legendary for its ruggedness and reliability in real life and is accurately represented in War Thunder. This aircraft is easy to land with its strong landing gear. The large radial engine and sturdy wings can take some hits and still make it home, and, as in the Pacific theatre, this plane was very hard to set alight due to its self-sealing fuel tanks. Don't jump out of your burning Hellcat just yet! You can take bombs and rockets to become a formidable ground attacker, and even take Tiny Tim rockets for extreme anti-ship and anti-tank capabilities. You will earn Silver Lions  very quickly thanks to the Premium vehicle bonus. The M2 Browning machine guns can load Ground targets belts to destroy light vehicles easily, as well as medium tanks and light pillboxes (though with some difficulty). In the bomber hunter role, use Universal belts (as with the fighter role) as they contain the most Incendiary rounds to set nearly anything alight, double time. Just remember to not get carried away with staying behind bombers - they can shoot into your engine and set you alight; sometimes with no hope of getting rid of the fire. Though this aircraft is a Jack of All Trades, one may say this is a disadvantage itself - being master of none. Aircraft that excel in certain categories such as climb rate, manoeuvrability, and firepower can beat you if they play smart - but remember, if you play smart too, you may come out on top, even against very deadly aircraft such as the earlier mentioned Yak-3.
