Description of Spitfire_F_Mk_XVIIIe: 
Although visually similar to the Mk XIV, the Spitfire Mk XVIIIe was purpose-built from scratch as a new project, unlike the Mk XIV which was a Spitfire Mk VIII fuselage with a Griffon engine. The Mk XVIIIe received strengthened fuselage, gear, and airframe due to the added weight of the additional wing and fuselage fuel tanks. 299 of the Mk XVIIIe were made, the first 99 being in fighter configuration, with the remaining 200 for photo reconnaissance. The Mk XVIIIe was equipped with a type "E" wing, featuring two 20 mm Hispano cannons and two 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns. The Mk XVIIIe came too late to take part in WWII. Instead, between 1948 and 1949, they engaged in fighting Egyptian and Israeli Spitfires with 32nd and 208th Squadron RAF in Palestine.
