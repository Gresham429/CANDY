Description of Javelin_F.(A.W.)_Mk.9: 
After the end of WWII, the British government outlined the threat of strategic jet bombers and their ability to deliver nuclear weapons. The threat reached a critical level during 1947, when the Soviet Union's first strategic jet bombers like the IL-28 were nearing introduction to service. This caused the Air Ministry to issue Specification F.44/66, requiring a jet-powered, two-seat night fighter with radar capability. This aircraft was required to intercept enemy bombers at heights of up to 40,000 feet. It would also have to reach a maximum straight-line speed of 972 km/h at this height, and be able to perform rapid scrambles and ascents to attain the required altitude within ten minutes of engine ignition on the ground. Out of all the competing aircraft for this specification requirement, the renowned Gloster Aircraft Company, whom had already made a name for themselves shortly before by creating the Meteor, Britain's only operational jet fighter during WWII, would present the Gloster Javelin, a high-power interceptor that fulfilled the requirements. This design beat out the competition from de Havilland and was chosen by the Air Ministry in the early '50s to enter service under the FAW (Fighter, All Weather) designation class.
