History of Sunderland_Mk_IIIa: 
The Short Sunderland was a British flying boat aircraft crafted for the Royal Air Force pre-WW2 by the Short Brothers. Making its first test flight in 1937, it grew to become one of the most popular flying boat series used during World War II. It was operated by not only the RAF but the RNZAF (New Zealand), RCAF (Canada), RAAF (Australia), the French Navy, and many other nations. Powered by four Bristol Pegasus 9-cylinder radial engines, (and later, 14 cylinder Twin Wasp engines), it was also one of the most powerful flying boats used during WW2.
