Usage of Spitfire_Mk_IIb: 
The Spitfire is a high-performance thoroughbred, which is more than a match for any and all opposition it faces at its battle rating. However, if you don't know what you're up against and just try to out-turn everything with flat turns, you'll be able to get kills you need to grind up the tree, but you will not be able to excel in using the plane. Something important to remember is the seven P's: Proper Perusal, Planning & Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.
