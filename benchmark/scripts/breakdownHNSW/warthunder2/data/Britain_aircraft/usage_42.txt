Usage of Avenger_Mk_II_(Great_Britain): 
The Avenger Mk II is a single-engine torpedo bomber. Its dual forward-facing 12.7 mm MGs can be used to take out AA, artillery and vehicles while its 4 x 500 lb bombs can be put to good use against pillboxes, tanks or even ships. Defended very well, the Avenger has a dorsal turret with very good elevation and traverse angles armed with a single 12.7 mm that can inflict serious damage against enemy aircraft on your tail. The ventral turret has a single 7.62 mm MG, recommended to be equipped with AP belts to make up for its small calibre. Enemy fighters on your tail won't last long against the defensive armament. There is a dead spot behind the tail because the ventral turret doesn't have a huge amount of elevation, be careful not let a pursuing opponent manoeuvre there and change path to ensure you've always got your guns on target.
