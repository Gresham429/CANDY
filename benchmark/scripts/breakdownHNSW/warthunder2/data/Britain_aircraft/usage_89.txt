Usage of Lancaster_B_Mk_III: 
It is best to fly the Lancaster at a high altitude, at least 4,000 m, to be able to be unhindered by fighter aircraft. Beware, the aircraft has no defensive armament on the underside of the plane allowing an easy kill for experienced pilots. Due to this, and the large bomb load of the plane, it is best to target mini-bases and airfields, as moving tank columns are extremely difficult to hit, and even static targets like pillboxes can be tricky. Its defensive armament is lacking, so it is best to avoid enemy fighters altogether rather than attempting to fend them off. If you do find yourself under attack, weaving the plane left/right and up/down can help you dodge most of the fire, while allowing your turrets to still shoot back.
