Usage of Seafire_F_Mk_XVII: 
The Seafire F Mk XVII is a fighter that does best at low altitudes. Here, below 2,500 m, it climbs exceptionally well, and its engine has a great power output, but as soon as the plane passes that altitude, engine power begins to fall significantly. The best performance is had below 2,000 m of altitude, and above 3,500 m, engine performance is very much inadequate. Because of this, it is wise to pick and choose which engagements to commit to. It is often unwise to attack heavy bombers, both because the Seafire's armament can be lacking against such large enemies and because heavy bombers are usually found at high altitudes, where the Seafire's performance is greatly hampered. Instead, low-altitude dogfights are where the Seafire shines. It can also be used to defend ground units against enemy ground-attackers.
