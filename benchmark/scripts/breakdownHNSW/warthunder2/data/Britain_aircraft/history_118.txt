History of Javelin_F.(A.W.)_Mk.9: 
Gloster Javelin was the UK's first interceptor to use anti-air missiles[1] and the first jet all-weather and night fighter specifically designed for that purpose.[2] It went through a very convoluted development history, with a number of versions introduced between 1954 and 1959,[3] only to be replaced by the Electric Lightning from 1961 onwards.[4][5] To this day it's the western fighter with the largest wing area, featuring a massive 86.1 m² wing (comparing to 44.08 m² of the Lightning, 52.8 m² of the Ho 229 V3 or 43 m² of the F-35).
