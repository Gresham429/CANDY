Description of Havoc_Mk_I_(Great_Britain): 
The ▄Havoc Mk I is a premium rank II British bomber 
with a battle rating of 2.0 (AB/RB) and 2.3 (SB). It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. The Havoc Mk I is an excellent all-round bomber for its BR. The combination of speed, agility, and a forward-facing armament of 4 x .303 Brownings coupled with 4 x 500 lb bombs makes the Havoc a very versatile platform. Its speed allows the bomber to quickly enter and exit the combat area, run down other bombers or, act as a heavy fighter. The aircraft is capable of flying on a single engine, giving it a higher chance of surviving an engagement and making it back to base. In general, the Havoc has a sturdy airframe, capable of tanking large volumes of rifle-calibre machine gun fire (the most common weapon around its BR). The defensive armament of 2 separate .303 Vickers K machine guns is sufficient.
