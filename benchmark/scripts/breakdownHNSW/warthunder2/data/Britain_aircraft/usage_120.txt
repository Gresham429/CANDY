Usage of Scimitar_F_Mk.1: 
Thanks to its very powerful engines (it has a higher total thrust output than many supersonic aircraft), the Scimitar possesses an exception rate of climb and top speed for its BR, being easily one of, if not the fastest subsonic aircraft in the game. You should use this to your advantage when playing the Scimitar. At the start of the game you can choose to either go high or go low.
