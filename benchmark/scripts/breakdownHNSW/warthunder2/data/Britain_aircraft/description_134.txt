Description of F-4J(UK)_Phantom_II: 
Shortly after the Falklands War, the British Ministry of Defence decided to assign a dedicated air defence squadron to protect the islands from future attacks. However, this left a hole in the UK's mainland defence capabilities, and a decision was made to look for a surplus fighter until the Tornado F.3 could enter service. Both the F-14 and F-15 were considered, but seeing as those would cost more than intended for a short-term solution, the RAF instead opted for 15 upgraded ex-USN F-4Js, later known as the F-4J(UK)/Phantom F.3. These had maintained their General Electric J79-GE-108 engines and had largely adhered to the F-4J's original specifications but had undergone additional wiring to allow the carriage of British Skyflash missiles and the Telescopic Sighting System for visual identification of targets. The official rollout of the first complete F-4J(UK) was at North Island on August 10, 1984, and it was assigned to No. 74 Squadron RAF 'Tiger Squadron' at RAF Wattisham. The RAF received several batches of F-4J(UK)s, each one undergoing a Tiger Trial. This was a transatlantic flight from San Diego to Goose Bay, Canada, and then another flight to the UK with the help of tanker aircraft for aerial refueling. The F-4J(UK) served as a Quick Reaction Force for the RAF from 1984 to mid-1991, when they were replaced by the Tornado F.3.
