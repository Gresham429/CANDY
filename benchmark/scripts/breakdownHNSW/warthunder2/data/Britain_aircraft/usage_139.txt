Usage of Tornado_GR.1: 
There are multiple ways to use the Tornado in Air RB, one tactic is to stick to the team and try and give support with your AIM-9Ls on your way to the enemy bases and/or ground targets. This gives you the advantage of team cover and a bit of safety, although you will undoubtedly be in the midst of battle once enemy interceptors and fighters reach your team and there is always a chance that someone else will bomb all the bases.
