Usage of Spitfire_Mk_Vb: 
The Spitfire Mk Vb fills the role of an aerial superiority fighter in the British tier III lineup. It cannot fulfil any ground attack duties due to its low ammunition count and the absence of any heavy machine guns which can penetrate a tank's thin roof armour. In addition, the aircraft cannot carry any bombs or other air-to-ground ordnance. Like most Spitfires, the Spitfire Mk Vb is meant to be used as a pure aerial superiority fighter, while fighter-bomber duties are relegated to other aircraft, such as the Beaufighter series.
