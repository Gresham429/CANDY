Usage of Hunter_FGA.9: 
Side rush and burst climb, then enter the main cluster of aircraft in the middle (ideally with a height advantage). Your AIM-9Es (if you choose to bring them into battle) will quickly dispatch any enemies at a low energy state (hopefully distracted by fighting someone else). Use your superior speed in the cluster and launch your ordnance then zoom back up (the Boom & Zoom strategy). When you have expended your missiles, use your 30 mm ADENs as they are VERY destructive and typically only one shell is enough to critically damage or destroy any aircraft they come in contact with.
