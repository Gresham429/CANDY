Usage of Spitfire_F_Mk_IX: 
As a Spitfire Mk IX at its realistic mode battle rating, the most common and dangerous opponents are Bf 109s, normally the G-2/Trop and F-4 variants both of which often benefit from a better team composition on the axis side. When facing them, you should never attempt to hold an extended dogfight above 5,000 m as you will lose a significant portion of engine power in comparison to them. Instead, you should take the fight below 5 km where you can outrun a Bf 109 F-4, although Fw 190s and the German variant P-47 will catch up easily at the lower altitude.
