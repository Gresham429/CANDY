Usage of Wyvern_S4: 
Speed, climb rate, and armament are the Wyvern's only real method of taking out enemy aircraft. These are the strengths that any pilot of the Wyvern should always exploit, by employing Boom & Run tactics on enemies. With four Mk V Hispano cannons, and a staggeringly large ammo reserve, the Wyvern is more than equipped to quickly dispatch any aircraft that end up in front of it. The pilot should only take the plane up to a maximum of a couple thousand meters, unless bomber hunting, and use the Wyvern's excellent acceleration and top speed to quickly annihilate any enemies who end up on low altitude. The Wyvern can also use this speed to bait enemies, who see the Wyvern as an easy target, down to low altitudes. This will allow allied fighters to easily establish high altitude air superiority, which can often end up in victory by itself, without the Wyvern pilot actually putting himself in any great danger.
