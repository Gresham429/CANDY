Description of Spitfire_F_Mk_XIVe: 
The Spitfire F Mk XIVe was a British WWII-period fighter. Unlike the previous Griffon-powered Mk XIV, the XIVe featured a lowered tail section allowing for better rear view, as well as a new bubble canopy. The armament also differed from the regular Mk XIV as it featured an "E" type wing with two 20 mm Hispano cannons and two 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns instead of the "C" type with two cannons and four 7.7 mm machine guns.
