Description of Sea_Gladiator_Mk_I: 
The Gloster Sea Gladiator was a naval modification of the Gladiator biplane fighter in use by the Royal Air Force (RAF). 98 Sea Gladiators were completed: 38 "interim" airframes were modified from the existing Gladiator Mk II. Differences from the Gladiator Mk IIs in service with the RAF included the planes being fitted with catapult attachment points and a tail hook, the airframe being strengthened to withstand carrier landings, and a dinghy lifeboat being made mountable to the underbelly of the plane. It was powered by a nine-cylinder Bristol Mercury VIIA radial engine rated at 840 hp and mated to a three-blade Fairey metal fixed pitch propeller, while retaining the same armament as the Gladiator Mk.II.
