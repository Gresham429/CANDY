Usage of Typhoon_Mk_Ib: 
As a fighter, it is mainly a BnZ aircraft with lethal armament, especially the stealthy Air targets belts. Roll rate is below average but turn performance is decent for such a large aircraft. Where the Typhoon shines, as in real life, is in ground attack roles with 2 x 1000lbs bombs or 8 x RP-3 rockets. Used in this role the Typhoon can strike very fast and accurately and use its speed to disengage. Climb early in the battle as performance is maintained even with 2 x 1000 bombs underneath, select the target and bomb in a shallow dive. Disengage with a shallow climb at great speed away from enemy fighters. Softer targets can be destroyed easily with the cannons. This aircraft can be a real lion farmer used in a mixed role of fighter bomber attacking unsuspecting slower enemy aircraft, or blasting through furballs at high speed. The Air Targets belts will reward the good shot. Performance is best below 6 km (20000 ft). When manoeuvring keeps the speed up, this is a heavy aircraft and will not easily regain energy lost by high loads, making it vulnerable.
