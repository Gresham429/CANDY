Description of Spitfire_Mk_Vb: 
The advent of the high-altitude Ju 86 bomber over Britain in late 1940 saw a growing need for a new high-altitude-capable (pressurised) variant of the Spitfire. A stop-gap solution was presented in the Spitfire Mk V, a Mk I airframe fitted with a new Merlin 45 engine, producing 1,440 hp and incorporating a new single-stage supercharger, as well as other improvements including a carburettor able to handle zero-G manoeuvres without fuel flow issues. The Mk Vb was the main production model, featuring the B-type wing equipping dual Hispano cannons and quad Browning .303 machine guns. Spitfire Mk Vs were also commonly operated overseas, resulting in their tropicalised counterparts. However, the Spitfire Mk V was quickly outclassed by the introduction of the Fw 190 in 1941, and they were soon superseded by the Spitfire F Mk IX.
