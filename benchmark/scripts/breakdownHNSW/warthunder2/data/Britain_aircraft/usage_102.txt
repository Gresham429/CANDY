Usage of Sea_Meteor_F_Mk_3: 
The Sea Meteor F Mk 3 is navalised version of the Meteor F Mk 3. While the navalised components (tail hook, stronger gear, etc.) have added approximately 1,250 kg to the aircraft's weight, the Sea Meteor has also had its Derwent 2 engines replaced with vastly more powerful Derwent 5 engines. The end result is that the Sea Meteor has a ~25% increase in thrust to weight ratio over the Meteor F Mk 3. This improvement gives the Sea Meteor excellent acceleration and speed compared to its predecessor.
