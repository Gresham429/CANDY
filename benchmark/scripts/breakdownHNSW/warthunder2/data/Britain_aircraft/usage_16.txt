Usage of Wirraway_(Great_Britain): 
In Arcade, the Wirraway makes a great fighter-bomber, good for attacking ground units but also to rack up some aerial victories. In Realistic, the Wirraway becomes even better. While sluggish when fully laden, once it releases it bombs it is very manoeuvrable and will out turn almost everything it comes across. Use its manoeuvrability to your advantage as your weak armament will do some, but not a lot of, damage. The rear machine gun can be useful of scaring off enemies commonly faced by the Wirraway such as the He 51 and the Ki-27. The highest ranked plane it will see is the Bf 109 E-1 which are devastating to the little Wirraway. This little plane may be nimble but it is not fast. It is one of the slowest climbers in the game and with a max speed of 356 km/h even the slowest of planes can catch up to it. Try to avoid dive battles or diving in general as the airframe is not strong and will break under high speeds.
