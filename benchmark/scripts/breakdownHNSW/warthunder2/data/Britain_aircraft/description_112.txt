Description of Canberra_B_(I)_Mk_6: 
The Canberra B Mk 6 was the second production run of the English Electric Canberra, improving over the original Mk 2 with more powerful engines, fuel tanks in the wings, and a slightly lengthened fuselage. An interdictor variant known as the Canberra B (I) Mk 6 was also created as an interim prior to introduction of the more dedicated Mk 8, featuring a detachable ventrally mounted gun pod enclosing four 20 mm Hispano cannons, two wing hardpoints to make up for the partially occupied bomb bay, and provision for a toss bombing system allowing the use of nuclear weapons. Entering service in 1955, the Canberra B (I) Mk 6 was soon withdrawn from Bomber Command operations in 1961, but maintained operational readiness in the nuclear delivery role until 1972.
