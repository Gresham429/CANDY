History of PGZ09: 
During the late 1980s, after attempts to make their own AA guns to replace the obsolete Soviet 37 mm, the PLA sought instead to purchase the renowned Swiss Oerlikon 35 mm GDF-002 cannon. In 1987, a deal was made and examples were imported along with the Skyguard system, and in 1990, China got a license for domestic production under the name PG90. When the later arms embargo in the 1990s stopped additional importation, Chinese-made domestic upgrades resulted in the PG99, which is said to be on-par with the GDF-003.
