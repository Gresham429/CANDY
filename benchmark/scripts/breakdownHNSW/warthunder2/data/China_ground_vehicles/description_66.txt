Description of MBT2000: 
The MBT2000, known as the Al-Khalid in Pakistan, is an export MBT solution by NORINCO as a result of the Sino-Pakistan Type 90-II program in 2001. The menacing T-72S fleet in India was becoming a major threat to Pakistan, thus they sought for the help of Mainland China which was developing new MBTs as well. The new MBT would follow the requirements from Pakistan, while NORINCO would design and manufacture the tank accordingly. Thanks to improving relations with western powers, NORINCO acquired German engines and transmissions for their prototypes; the new BK1871 prototype was approved by Pakistan and was set as the foundation of the new MBT. The agreement was signed in 1990 and thus earned the name of Type 90 (-II was added to avoid confusion with the JGSDF's Type 90). Although there were plans to use NATO powerplants and transmissions, after political complications in both China and Pakistan, the Type 90-II would source the power pack from Ukraine (6TD from T-80UD which was also imported by Pakistan). The 3rd Type 90-II prototype was approved as the Type 90-IIM; with domestic FY-series ERA and AC unit for crew comfort installed. The new MBT, now under the name of MBT2000, was finalized in 2000 and first shown in Abu Dhabi IDEX 2001 as a new export product of NORINCO. The MBT2000 is still listed on the catalogue with revised designs and equipment for future battlefields alongside with its high-end counterpart, VT-4A1.
