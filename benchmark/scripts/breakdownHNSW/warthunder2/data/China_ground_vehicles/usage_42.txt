Usage of ZBD86: 
Some experience with the previous Type 62 will transfer to the ZBD86. Both are armed with HEAT rounds, have similar mobility, and are best used in ambushes. The ZBD86 enjoys a significantly faster reload, better turret rotation speed, and powerful ATGMs to supplement the main gun. However, the ZBD86 has poorer defensive properties since it's a larger target and has worse gun depression. It is even more important to maintain stealth and good positioning, but on the bright side it can unleash a lot of pain onto its victims upon a successful attack.
