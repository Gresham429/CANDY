History of CM25: 
During the heat of the Vietnam War, Taiwan was one of the major bases for US operations against the North Vietnamese forces; while the M113 APC was an iconic vehicle in the war, it also suffered from heavy losses to the Viet Cong. As such, the US signed an agreement with the Taiwanese government in 1967 to refurbish and repair M113s that were recovered by US forces under the "Third-Nation Overhaul Program" (第三國翻修計劃).
