History of M48A1_(China): 
Due to the impact of the Vietnam War, the United States changed its military aid policy to Taiwan. The United States no longer provided its surplus armaments for free to the ROCA, and instead required the ROCA to purchase equipment in the form of military aid loans. As a result, the progress of the ROCA's upgrade to newer American-made equipment began to stagnate.
