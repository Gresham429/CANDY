History of IS-2_No.402: 
Little information about the No.402 IS-2 can be found. It is believed that this IS-2 tank belongs to the 1st Division of Volunteer Tank Division, and participated in the Ma Liangshan defensive counterattack in November 1951. In the battle, the No.402 IS-2 won awards for continuously destroying many (believed to be around 6) United Nation fortifications. The crew members were awarded the collective second-class merit. It is speculated that it may be the 1st Battalion and 2nd Company of the 3rd Regiment of Tanks of the Division ("Tanshan Model Company for Fortification Fighting"), which was assigned to the 191st Division of the 64th Army to participate in the counterattack.
