Usage of PLZ83: 
As the very first enclosed SPH of PLAGF, PLZ83 does have some flaws since its introduction, but with careful planning and only firing when players are certain of a knock-out or fatal blow to enemy vehicles, the PLZ83 can still play like its counterparts at its tier with extra caution.
