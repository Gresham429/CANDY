Description of Type_69-IIa: 
The Type 69-IIa (BW121A) is among the best-sellers of Chinese weaponries as the most exported tanks for Mainland China. The tank was based on the Type 69-II design with reverted rifled 100 mm gun due to the inferior performance of the previous smoothbore cannon on the Type 69. The dire needs for foreign exchange to boost the economic reform by the 1980s let the newly-founded NORINCO took Type 69-IIA as their "spearhead" product during military sales to foreign countries, namely Iran and Iraq which happened to acquired thousands of these tanks during their conflicts in 1980s. While the performance was nowhere close to the tanks of NATO/Warsaw-Pact forces, the low price point and rather huge stock made Type 69-IIA a staple in Middle East battlefields with upgrades done by their respective users; although they were also infamous for being the theme of photos during the Gulf War and later Iran War as "coffins of Iraqi tankers", many of these tanks are now part of different insurgents' armoured vehicles inventory.
