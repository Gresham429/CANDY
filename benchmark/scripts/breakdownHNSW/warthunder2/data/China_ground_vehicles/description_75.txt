Description of WZ1001(E)_LCT: 
The Wu Zhuang 1001(E) LCT [Long Cannon Testbed] (Chinese: WZ1001(E) 125毫米多功能火炮试验车; lit. 125 mm Multipurpose Gun Test Vehicle) was one of the prototype of what later became the ZTZ99A. Visually, it distinguishes itself from the production version with a longer gun, a smooth finish for the FY-5 ERA instead of matte, and a different hull. Before ZTZ99 was introduced to PLAGF, there were already plans for a new "3rd generation tank" where the ZTZ99 (WZ123 at the time) would be the gap-filler before the new tanks could be introduced; as soon as ZTZ99 was certified in early 2000s, Institute 70 already started the WZ1001 program with various designs led by the new chief designer Mao Ming (毛明); the tank in-game represents the 2nd prototype of WZ1001 with a longer L/54 125 mm smoothbore cannon and a hull based on ZTZ99-III. Due to economics and better reliability for the gun system, the LCT was ditched and the other prototype with L/48 cannon was then certified as what known as ZTZ99A.
