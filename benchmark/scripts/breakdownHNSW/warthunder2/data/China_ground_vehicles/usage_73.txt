Usage of ZTZ96A_(P): 
Since the ZTZ96A prototype shares the same chassis of the mass-production version, the protection all-round is identical to the ZTZ96A. The LFP will be the greatest concern players might have during gameplay; the relatively large LFP doesn't have enough protection against common shell types at its tier, and a penetration will certainly lead to a crew knock-out or detonation of ammunition, so keep it hidden as much as possible. Meanwhile, the UFP has blocks of FY-4 ERA that provide up to 500 mm protection at certain angles, making it one of the toughest MBTs at its tier in this regard; the blocks are one-off protection however so beware of subsequent shots on unprotected areas. As for the turret, the design of applique armour provides similar protection to the ZTZ96A against shells at this tier, but the overall design is flawed where the lower part of the wedge block and areas in front of the mantlet provide lesser protection. Aside from that, any angling of turret will result in easy penetration of the applique armour since the angling cancels out the frontal arc protection, so do keep your turret aiming at enemies.
