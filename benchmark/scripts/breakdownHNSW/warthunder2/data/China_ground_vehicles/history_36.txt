History of SU-100_(China): 
The People's Republic of China (PRC) acquired 99 SU-100 self-propelled guns and other armoured vehicles from the Soviet Union in 1954, when the Soviet 39th Army withdrew from Lüda (now Dalian). Much of the armour, previously used by the Soviet 7th Mechanized Division, was used by the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s 190th Division. The 190th Division was then renamed to the 1st Mechanized Division (第1机械化师), and among its materiel were 24 of the SU-100 tank destroyers.
