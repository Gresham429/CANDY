Description of T-34_(1943)_(China): 
The T-34 (1943) is the fourth variant of the T-34 medium tank family. Built in 1943 and armed with a 76.2 mm F-34 tank gun, its was more powerful than its contemporaries when it was introduced, and its 60-degree sloping armour provided excellent protection against anti-tank weapons. In general, the T-34s had an enormous impact on the Eastern Front battle and had a long-lasting impact on tank design. During World War II, the Soviet Union sent a small amount of the T-34 (1943) to China. Some were also left behind by the Soviets during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which resulted in the defeat of Japan's Kwantung Army (関東軍/かんとうぐん/关东军). However, the T-34 (1943) saw extremely limited action in China, as the main variant used by the Chinese People's Liberation Army was the T-34-85 (S-53), a considerable remodelling of the original T-34 that increased firepower through the introduction of the 85 mm Zavod imeni Stalina (ZiS) S-53 tank gun.
