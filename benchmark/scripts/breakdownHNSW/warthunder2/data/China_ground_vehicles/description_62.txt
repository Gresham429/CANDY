Description of Object_122MT_%22MC%22: 
The Object 122 Medium Tank "Mechanical Controls" (unified Chinese naming: 122工程 to all the MBTs under this project) was the attempt of Chinese engineers to develop a 2nd generation MBT during late 1960s and 1970s in view of the possible invasion from Soviet Union. The plan for a new MBT was proposed way before the heat of Sino-Soviet border conflicts where PLAGF has to chase the mainstreams of tanks of the era (which ZTZ59 were by the time the most advanced tank) as the Campaign 2-4; due to the captured T-62 from Soviet Union and its new technologies, engineers of the Luoyang Tractor Factory (now the YTO; 一拖 at Luoyang, Henan) built their prototypes for the "Object 122" with 4 ATGMs and the very first 120 mm smoothbore cannon developed (decade before Rheinmetall), as well as sporting new FCS and new engines. Due to the route changes during the Cultural Revolution and the eventual cancellation of new armored vehicles during the 1970s, Object 122MT was halted and is now stored somewhere in the main factory of YTO Luoyang Factory.
