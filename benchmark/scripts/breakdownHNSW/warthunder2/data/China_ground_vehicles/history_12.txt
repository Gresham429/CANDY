History of M4A4_(China): 
Due to a production shortage of Ford GAA V8 engines, the M4A4 was equipped with Chrysler A57 multibank engines instead. The production ran from July 1942 to November 1943, with 7,499 M4A4 produced. Because of the much more complex maintenance that the Chrysler engine required, the M4A4 was unpopular with American mechanics. Nearly all models were sent to the British, Soviets, and Chinese through Lend-lease.
