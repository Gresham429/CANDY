Description of Chi-Ha_Kai_(China): 
The Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai (九七式中戦車 改「チハ」) is a World War II Japanese medium tank that was an upgrade to the original Type 97 Chi-Ha. The Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai ("improved") or Shinhōtō Chi-Ha ("new turret" Chi-Ha) was equipped with a Type 1 47 mm anti-tank gun and was often regarded as the best Japanese tank to have seen combat service during the Pacific War. Many Soviet-captured Japanese tanks were delivered to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. By 1949, the People's Liberation Army had 349 tanks, including Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai tanks. The Type 97 Chi-Ha Kai tanks were also instrumental in the official formation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's first tank brigade. On December 1, 1945, Gao Ke of the Northeast People's Autonomous Army (later renamed the Northeast Democratic Alliance Army) captured two Japanese Type 97 modified (Chi-Ha Kai) medium tanks from the Japanese "918" repair factory in Shenyang. They were designated as No. 101 and No. 102, respectively. With these two tanks, the People's Army officially formed the first tank brigade, the Northeast Tank Brigade.
