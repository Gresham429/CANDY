Description of ZSD63/PG87: 
The ZSD63/PG87, Dual-Barrel AA (known in Chinese client as ZSD63式履带裝甲输送车/PG87式双管高射炮, industry code: WZ531 for the chassis) was the field modification from PLAGF to build make-shift SPAA before new SPAAGs made into commission. The concept of ZSD63 started in 1958 as a fully-enclosed tracked APC with amphibious capabilities; after the flaws in design and new upgrades introduced to the 531A prototype, the ZSD63 eventually joined PLAGF in 1970 as the first domestic APC in service and has been used during the Vietnam War by Viet Cong and Sino-Vietnamese War by both side. The SPAA variant was likely the modification built in 1990s with dozer to reduce recoil during firing; alongside with other truck-base SPAA with PG87 25 mm autocannon, they served PLAGF to at least into the 21st Century when new SPAAG eventually replaced them.
