Usage of CM11: 
Like most MBTs in the Chinese tech tree, the CM11 should be played in a laid back, cautious manner since its firepower is good but its speed is not nearly sufficient for flanking quickly and catching enemies by surprise. Unfortunately, its poor armour and large profile make hull-down sniping difficult, though it does enjoy better gun depression than most PRC/Soviet tanks. It is best to stay close to cover and observe the environment. When the enemies are spotted, pop out, shoot first, and try to at least cripple them. The DM63 APFSDS has very good penetration for a 105 mm round, easily penetrating almost all targets that the CM11 is likely to encounter. The fast reload time ensures rapid follow-up shots. If the teammates do a good job distracting the enemy team or the CM11 somehow manages to flank successfully, several targets can be knocked out in rapid succession. Make good use of the thermal optics, as not all tanks at its battle rating feature them and they are very advantageous for spotting enemies early.
