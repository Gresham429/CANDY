Description of M4A4_(China): 
The M4A4 Sherman is the fifth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. The only record of the M4A4 variant serving in the Chinese Nationalist Army is within the Chinese Expeditionary Forces (中國遠征軍), where the Chinese Kuomintang government equipped 32 such tanks through the lend-lease program and established the 1st Provisional Tank Group stationed in India, commanded by U.S. Army colonel Rothwell H. Brown. Following the end of World War II, Chinese Expeditionary Forces - the New First Army and the New Sixth Army - equipped with M4A4 Shermans participated in the Chinese Civil War. Both armies were defeated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army during the Liaoshen Campaign in Northeast China. Following the Chinese Civil War, a memorial for fallen Chinese Expeditionary Force soldiers was constructed in Tengchong, Yunnan.
