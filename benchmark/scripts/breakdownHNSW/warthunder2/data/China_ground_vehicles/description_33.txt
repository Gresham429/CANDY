Description of Ph%C3%B2ng_kh%C3%B4ng_T-34: 
The Xe tăng phòng không 37 mm (37 mm anti air tank), known as the Phòng không T-34 (Chữ Nôm: 防空 T-34; English: Anti-air T-34) for short or by its erroneous designation "Type 65" in Chinese sources, was a North Vietnamese SPAAG created during the mid-1960s for the Vietnam war. It uses the hull of a Soviet T-34-85 but features an original open-top box turret fitted with dual Chinese 37 mm Type 65 cannons. It's likely that the NVA improvised this build during the Vietnam War, since North Vietnam invested heavily in anti-air weaponry to combat the US air support. However no NVA documentation on the vehicle is known and all known information comes from one unit captured by US forces during the war, which is now displayed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The name "Xe tăng phòng không 37 mm" was created for the game as the vehicle's real name is unknown, based on the descriptive names of other NVA vehicles of the time.
