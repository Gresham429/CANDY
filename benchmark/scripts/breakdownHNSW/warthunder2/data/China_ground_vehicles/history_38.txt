History of M64: 
After retreating to the island of Taiwan after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War, the ROCA was in dire need of new tanks to supplement the heavy losses of armoured vehicles; newer vehicles such as M24 Chaffee and M18 GMC were among the new tanks purchased in the early 1950s. M42 Dusters were purchased later in 1958 as military aid from the United States.
