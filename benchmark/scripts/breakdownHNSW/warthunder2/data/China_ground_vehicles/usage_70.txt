Usage of PGZ04A: 
With its rapid-firing 25 mm guns and IR missiles, the PGZ04A does serve its purpose in close to mid-range air defense. Consider it to have two layers of defence: missiles for up to 6 km (depends on the target; it can lock onto jets at around 5 km; while helicopters is another story depending on its size and their heat signature), and the 25 mm cannons for anything within 3 km. The IR missiles have questionable tracking ability and often give up track on a target entirely if it manoeuvres to evade. However, it will help to distract incoming aircraft and bleed their speed, making them easier to be finished with the 25 mm cannons. The PGZ04A will have a tough time dealing with helicopters hovering at their maximum range launching ATGMs, as neither of the PGZ04 armaments can reach anything that's beyond 6 km.
