Usage of M41A3_(China): 
The M41 series are well known for their great mobility and great variety of shells at their tiers; in the case of the ROCA's M41A3, its battle rating is significantly lower than its US-allied counterparts. This might sound good to players as the gun can finally handle most targets even up front. All things come at a cost though - in this case, APDS and HEATFS are not available, so remembering where armour weakspots of enemy vehicles are is very essential for quick and clean victories, more shots fired means higher risk of being hunted down.
