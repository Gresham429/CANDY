History of WZ1001(E)_LCT: 
As part of the "3rd Generation MBT" program of the PLAGF after the introduction of the "placeholder" WZ123/ZTZ99, the new MBT started its prototype production and trials. Designed by a new engineer, Mao Ming (毛明), the tank was built with 3 different prototypes: a "123AY" with higher engine deck for the latest 12V 150HB-1 engine and CH1000 transmission developed by Zhou Guangming (周广明), and two other prototypes, now dubbed WZ1001, one with a turret similar to the mass-produced ZTZ99A, and the other with a 125 mm L/54 for higher velocity and penetration.
