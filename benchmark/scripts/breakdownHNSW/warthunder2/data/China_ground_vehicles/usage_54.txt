Usage of ZTZ88B: 
Although ZTZ88B still appears to be a T-54/Type 59 derivative from its oval shape turret and hull design, but when players hear the similar engine sound to a T-72 and the gun has heat sleeves, as well as seeing the composite applique armor on the front, ZTZ88B will become the tank that will hit them hard.
