Description of ZTZ99-II: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 99 Stage II (ZTZ99式主战坦克 二类定型状态, aka 99一期改; coded WZ123) is the accepted version of the ZTZ99 in PLAGF service since the early 2000s. The plan for a new MBT for the PLAGF arose after the Project 122, which was lacking in firepower against possible Soviet assaults on Mainland China. The project for a new tank was issued in April 1984, and developments during the 1980s included evaluations on Object 172M-1 E-4 (known as T-72 Ural or Type 64 六四型 by Chinese engineers) and later mock-up targets of the T-80U. The standards were revised during development, and the new 3rd generation MBT was tested extensively during the 1990s. The finalized prototypes/LRIP models (ZTZ99-I) were then first shown during the 50th National Day Parade. These LRIP tanks, which were yet to be built at the factory, later received new protection packages in 2004 with FY-4 ERA on both the UFP and turret, leading to the well-known design of the ZTZ99.
