Description of T-34-85_(S-53)_(China): 
The T-34-85 (S-53) Model 1944 is a remodelling of the late-production T-34-85 variant with the introduction of an 85 mm Zavod imeni Stalina (ZiS) S-53 tank gun. Being the sixth variant of the T-34 medium tank family, it features an easier-to-reload ZiS S-53 tank gun, a radio relocated from the hull into a turret with an improved layout, and an improved gunner's sight. The T-34-85 (S-53) arrived in China as part of a Soviet military assistance package. With the start of the Korean War, China received 300 T-34-85 medium tanks, along with many trucks and other support vehicles. A total of more than 2,000 military vehicles, as well as three large and medium-sized repair factories and various ammunition, were transferred to China. The T-34-85 (S-53) was the main armoured backbone of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during the Korean War, performing various missions ranging from tank-to-tank combat to infantry support.
