Usage of WMA301: 
Like its domestic cousin, the WMA301's main advantages lie in its mobility and gun sight. As such one of the tactics the WMA301 can utilise is long-range engagements. Since it has an excellent second-generation gunner thermal, great APFSDS, and a laser rangefinder, it can comfortably sit behind and snipe. To be an effective sniper the player must have adequate map knowledge and memorise sniping locations on different maps. Because the WMA301 has very poor gun depression and slow reverse speed, these constrains place further limitations on the available spots, and unfortunately the player would not be able to use certain spots that other nations' wheeled vehicles can use.
