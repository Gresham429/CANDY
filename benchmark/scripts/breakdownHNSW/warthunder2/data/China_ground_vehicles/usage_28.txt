Usage of Type_62: 
With its excellent mobility, the Type 62 is great for getting from point to point and setting up ambushes. Avoid getting seen and stick close to concealment and cover. However it is important to note that the reload rate is around the same or even slower than most enemy tanks, so making your first shot count is always going to determine whether you survive the engagement or not. Aiming for the turret or ammo racks of the enemy are great options, as they usually ensure ammo rack detonations or that the enemy won't be able to fire back at you if not. Always have a backup plan in case your shot does not disable the enemy in one hit, which will typically mean moving to cover immediately and waiting for the target to be distracted. If you need to retreat, the Type 62 now has access to barrel-type smoke grenades seen on the ZTZ59A and several Soviet tanks, which should allow you to safely turn around and leave the area.
