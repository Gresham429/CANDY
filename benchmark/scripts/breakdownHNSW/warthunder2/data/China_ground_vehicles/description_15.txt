Description of M10_GMC_(China): 
In 1948, the Republic of China's party, Kuomintang, ordered the Armoured Forces Command to acquire abandoned military surplus specially from the Pacific theatre. A total of 34 M10 TDs were purchased from the US, which at the time was trying to dispose as much military surplus as possible. The vehicles never saw combat in mainland China, instead they were evacuated to Taiwan. In 1949, with the new government established in Taiwan, the vehicles received several modifications, some of which included the installation of a Japanese Type 91 105 mm howitzer, effectively transforming the vehicle into a self-propelled artillery piece. At the end, the vehicles were retired from said role, with the introduction of the more specialized M7 Priest in 1955-1957.
