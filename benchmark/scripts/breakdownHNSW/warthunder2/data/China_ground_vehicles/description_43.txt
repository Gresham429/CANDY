Description of M48A1_(China): 
The ␗90 mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton III , officially known as the M48A1戰車 and M48A3戰車* after engine refit, was the main composition of ROCA armored corps in 1970s until 1990s. As PLAGF and PLANMC have already acquired Type 59s for their armored brigades/divisions, ROCA saw the complications of their already obsolete fleet of US-built light tanks would be hopeless against the former; but this would be further hindered by the end of Mutual Aid Program with free aids, meaning any future equipment have to be purchased. By 1973, ROCA started to purchase M48A1 from US Army stocks under the Project Fire Bull (火牛專案) and has acquired 309 of them in 4 separated batches by 1980; due to the signature of Sino (Mainland China)-US treaties regarding to military sales to Nationalist Government, these tanks would be the main force until later purchase of M60A3TTS from US. Most M48A1s were then upgraded with new diesel engine with spare parts purchased from USA, while one of these tanks is experimented with a 105 mm M68 gun under the name Wancheng IV (萬乘四號) or M48A5; most of these tanks would be decommissioned by 1990s with the arrival of M60A3TTS and domestic rebuilt CM11 (M48H; based on M60A3TTS chassis and M48A5 turret), while 100 of these M48A1s would be modified with spare FCS from CM11 and refitted with M68A1 gun as the CM12. Due to the lack of spare parts from M48 series, these CM12 tanks were all in reserve until M1A2T eventually arrives in mid-2020s.
