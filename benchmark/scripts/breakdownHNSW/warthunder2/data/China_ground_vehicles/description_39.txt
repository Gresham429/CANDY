Description of T-34-85_No.215: 
The T-34-85 No.215 is a special T-34-85 (S-53) medium tank of historical significance during the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War. The T-34-85 No.215 took part in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, also known as the Battle of Seokhyeon-dong Northern Hill (石岘洞北山战斗) in July 1953, against the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The T-34-85 No.215 accidentally drove into muddy terrain while spotting a U.S. tank column at 1,400 metres while travelling at night. The crew immediately camouflaged the tank to avoid aerial reconnaissance by U.S. planes and successfully ambushed 3 U.S. tanks the next day, destroying 2 and seriously damaging 1. During the retreat, it exchanged fire with a few pursuing tanks, destroying two additional U.S. tanks. Throughout the Korean War, the tank crew of the T-34-85 No.215 destroyed 5 tanks, 9 mortars, 1 military vehicle, 26 enemy bunkers, 1 tunnel, and 1 command post. It also successfully provided infantry support in 7 combat operations. The Chinese Army awarded the prestigious title "People's Hero Tank (人民英雄坦克)" to the T-34-85 No.215 tank in appreciation of its significant military achievements, and all crew members were given the first-class merit award. The decommissioned T-34-85 No.215 tank is now on exhibit in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution (中国人民革命军事博物馆) for public viewing.
