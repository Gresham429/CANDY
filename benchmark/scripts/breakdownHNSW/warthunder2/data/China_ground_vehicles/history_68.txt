History of ZTZ99-II: 
In the late 1960s, Mainland China had found that the PLAGF was lagging behind the mainstream of MBTs of the era; the menacing Soviet armoured brigades in the Far East were also a great concern as well, especially after Damansky (Zhenbao) Island Incident where they captured a T-62. During the mid-1970s, the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND 国防科学技术工业委员会) made a few attempts to design new MBTs under the code WZ122 with multiple prototypes; technological issues put an end to those prototypes in the mid-1970s.
