Description of T-34-85_Gai: 
The Т-34-85 Gai (Chinese: T or 特[Te]-34-85改) was what would become the first domestic tank built by Mainland China in the 1950s. Due to the demand for new tanks to fulfill the needs of new armour divisions, Chinese engineers reverse-engineered or acquired the blueprints for the T-34/85 Mod. 1944 in the late 1950s. This version represents a planned modification equipping a HMG on the commander's cupola and minor appearance changes for domestic production. Due to the introduction of complete T-54A blueprints that set the foundations for the Type 59, the production plan for the T-34-85 was ditched and the remaining fleet was left in reserve until the 1990s.
