Usage of WZ1001(E)_LCT: 
A major difference of WZ1001 to its technological predecessors/successor is the gun barrel itself. In most cases, the PLAGF adopted for a L/48 gun, but due to the need for greater penetration against potential foes, the WZ1001 has a longer barrel than most MBTs in game, while retaining the very familiar 125 mm calibre.
