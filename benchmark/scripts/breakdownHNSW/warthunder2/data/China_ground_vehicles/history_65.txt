History of T-62_545_(China): 
After an initial period of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the fledgeling People's Republic of China, the Sino-Soviet split of 1956 soured relations between the two countries, resulting in the former allies becoming regional rivals. In 1969, the tensions came to a head as the PRC and USSR clashed over the disputed Zhenbao/Damansky Island for seven months. On March 2, 1969, the Soviet Army used a large number of advanced tanks and armoured vehicles in the Zhenbao/Damansky Island incident. Despite the PLA's warning, the Soviets repeatedly attempted to seize the Zhenbao/Damansky Island by force. At 11:07 on March 15, when four Soviet T-62 tanks formed a column to guide two armoured vehicles into the river branch on the west side of Zhenbao/Damansky Island, they were suddenly attacked by the ambush unit led by Yu Hongdong, the commander of the island garrison and reconnaissance platoon. In the panic, the Soviet force's leading T-62, No.545, drove into a hidden anti tank mine field set by the Chinese army earlier, and the right track was immediately blown up. The crew of the tank were killed by Chinese ambush detachment when abandoning the tank. The other three T-62 of the Soviet Army turned around and fled back along the same road. The T-62 whose track was broken by the anti tank mine was then left abandoned on the Chinese side of the ice-covered river.
