History of M41A3_(China): 
The ROCA received the first batches of the M41 series (A1 to A3) as replacements for the obsolete M24 Chaffee and M18 GMC in service. Due to the need to replace the older light tank fleet, the ROCA and ROCMC received 792 M41 series in 1981 as the main combat vehicle for the armed forces alongside the M48A1 series in their service. The M41 series would become key equipment during island defense exercises and training of the armored corps, as well as the only viable option to defend the outer islands (Matsu and Kinmen) thanks to their mobility and light weight. The M41A3 with fuel-injected diesel engine also became the target of reverse-engineering efforts to manufacture a domestic light tank for ROCA (as the Type 65) in 1976, but this never went into production.
