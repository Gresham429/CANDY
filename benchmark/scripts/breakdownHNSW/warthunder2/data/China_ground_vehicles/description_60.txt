Description of PTL02: 
The HuoPao TuJi LunShi 02 (Simplified Chinese: PTL02 轮式突击炮; lit. wheeled assault gun) is the first wheeled assault gun in PLAGF service as part of the modernization and mechanization of PLAGF by the late 1990s. The plans for a wheeled assault gun sprung up after seeing the performance of Coalition forces during the game-changing Gulf War when French AMX-10RC utilized the road network to assault Iraqi forces; before the Gulf War, PLAGF was testing the possibility to built such vehicles with the new WZ551 chassis based on Sino-German product from NORINCO Factory 256, two such vehicles were built under different caliber (smoothbore  100 mm and rifled 105 mm respectively); while the duo didn't make it into official development, the advances in technology in national defense industry and possible landing operations gave the second chance for the 100 mm prototype to utilize the extensive road network of enemies. The result of the 1997 version assault gun became what is now known as the PTL02 certified in October 2001 and was first publicly shown during National Day parade in 2009 as part a fire-support platform for artillery troops, while another prototype with 105 mm gun might likely been developed into the export-only WMA301.
