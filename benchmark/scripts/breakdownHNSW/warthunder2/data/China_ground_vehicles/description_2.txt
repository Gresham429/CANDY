Description of T-26_(China): 
The ‚êóT-26 mod. 1939 represented the T-26 Model 1933 (Note: the in-game model is Model 1939 which were never supplied to NRA, distinguished by the lack of rounded antenna around the turret of Model 1938) in NRA service by the time of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War; Soviet Union was still one of the weapon supplier to NRA where they were in dire need for tanks against invaders. 88 of these tanks were supplied alongside with some BT tanks via Northwestern China supply routes; these tanks served NRA from Shanghai to Burma where most of them seemed to have lost during the war, while very few of them somehow survived until the downfall of Nationalist forces in Mainland China where photos suggested these tanks were relocated to Taiwan Island but no further records marked the fate of these obsolete tanks; likely been scraped and replaced by US-aid tanks like M24 and M41 in near future.
