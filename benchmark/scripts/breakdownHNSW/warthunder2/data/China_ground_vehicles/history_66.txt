History of MBT2000: 
Date back to the previous Project 122 medium tanks by early 1970s, there were at least 5 different designs from different designers with different features; although Chinese engineers were very ambitious on their designs with some uncertified technologies, when the decade between 1978 to 1988 where Mainland China has improved relationship with western powers, the engineers saw one of the most advanced MBT at the time: Leopard 2 with unimaginable mobility for the engineers at the time. Although failed attempts to introduce either Leopard 2 or its powerplant, thanks to the Project 784 (WZ123; the future ZTZ99) and the debates of powerplant for the tank, Datong Diesel Engine Plant introduced MTU 8V331TC-41 and its production line from West Germany, the engineers put together a prototype: WZ1224 with the aforementioned engine. Another prototype with a hydraulic transmission known as WZ1226 was also built as part of the restarted Project 122 MBT; these were the beginnings of the future MBT2000.
