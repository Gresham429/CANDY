Description of SU-100_(China): 
The SU-100 (Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 100) is a Soviet tank destroyer with a casemate superstructure and a 100 mm D-10S tank gun. It saw widespread action in the final year of World War II and was utilized for many years afterwards by Soviet allies' forces all over the world. After December 1, 1950, when Soviet forces left Dalian, formally concluding a ten-year military occupation, 99 SU-100s in Dalian were sold to China, and they were all assigned to the Chinese People's Liberation Army's newly formed 1st Mechanized Division. During the Korean War, the SU-100s were extensively deployed, particularly to ambush enemy armoured vehicles.
