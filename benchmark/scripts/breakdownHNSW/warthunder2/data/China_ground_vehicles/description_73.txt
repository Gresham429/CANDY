Description of ZTZ96A_(P): 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 96A, Prototype was the failed prototype of what would have been known as the WZ122R where certain tank designers opted for an irregular, needle-nosed turret applique armour for what would later become the ZTZ96A. Due to undisclosed reasons, this design was ditched by PLAGF and the known design of what is now known as ZTZ96A won the competition; this prototype was then lost in history and only very few images could prove its existence.
