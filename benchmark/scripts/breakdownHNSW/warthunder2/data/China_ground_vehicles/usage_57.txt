Usage of PGZ09: 
Like its counterparts in NATO and Japan, speed is your friend and the PGZ09 is among the fastest ones, as an SPAA, your first priority should be aircraft and helicopters. At its BR range, few aircraft come with an RWR, so there should no worries on keeping the radar always on. If brought to a higher BR, do not keep your radar on for extended periods of time, as it will give yourself away to aircraft with RWR, so turn it off and only utilize the tracking radar after enemies have been spotted; alternatively, it comes with optoelectronic tracking system which helps concealing yourself from RWR-equipped aircraft (hotkey Y-1-4 by default changes between its tracking systems) or tracking low-flyers with excellent accuracy; another thing worth mention is that it's the only Oerlikon GDF-002 equipped SPAAG that comes with a thermal gunner sight (2nd generation), further accelerate your speed on spotting enemies from the background. Keep in mind your subpar ammunition count, so unless in emergency or fast-and-close targets, trigger-happy firing is not an option.
