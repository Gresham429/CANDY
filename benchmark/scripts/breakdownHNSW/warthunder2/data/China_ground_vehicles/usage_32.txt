Usage of IS-2_(1944)_(China): 
The IS-2 '44 is a definite improvement on its predecessor, the IS-2. Most notably the frontal armour now features a slope, which can bounce or outright block some rounds. This iteration of the IS-2 also features a roof-mounted machine gun that can be used to attack aircraft without moving your turret (by using weapon selection keys set in the controls). Otherwise, the IS-2 '44 is identical to the IS-2.
