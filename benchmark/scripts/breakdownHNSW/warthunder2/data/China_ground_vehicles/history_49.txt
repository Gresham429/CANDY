History of Type_69-IIa: 
The WZ121/BW121 (Type 69 and 79; coded BW when exported) was a family of medium tanks in Mainland China; their first domestic designs with new technologies introduced during the '70s and '80s. It was also the first commercially exported tank of the newly founded NORINCO, as Mainland China was in dire for arms deals in view of funding for economic reforms in the 1980s. The 69-II variant was the precursor of all export BW121 series with revised fire control system and safety features with automatic fire suppression system. They were first delivered in 1982 and the later batches of BW121A received turret fences and NBC filtering system for the crew. Due to the relatively low price over NATO or even Soviet tanks, the BW121 series received bulks of orders from countries with tight budgets, aside from Pakistan who had licensed production line and others that ordered ranging from dozens to hundreds, Iraq was the largest user of the BW121 series (2,860 69-II series and ARVs), including the later Type 79-based variants with 105 mm gun and western FCS. They were first used during the Iraq-Iran conflicts where oddly enough, both sides owned quantities of BW121; but the later Gulf War and Iraq War also gave the death sentence to these tanks for its overall obsolete design and outdated systems.
