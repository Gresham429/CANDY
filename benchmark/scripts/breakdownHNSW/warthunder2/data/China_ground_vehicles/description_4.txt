Description of Sd.Kfz.222_(China): 
The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 222 (Sd.Kfz.222), known as the Horch Armored Car (豪須裝甲車) from the name of manufacturer, was the second variant in the series of light four-wheel-drive armoured reconnaissance vehicles (Leichter Panzerspähwagen) manufactured in Germany between 1935 and 1944 by Horsh (now part of Audi). A substantial quantity of German-made equipment was transported to China in 1933, marking the start of the Kuomintang government's army reorganizing program. When these tanks were shipped, they were still painted in the dark grey of the German army. The Chinese Nationalist Army emblem was painted on the right rear side of the armoured car body and under the turret after it arrived in China, but the original German emblem was retained. The Sd.Kfz.222 was deployed by the Chinese Nationalist Army's special motorized unit. Its mission was serving as the fire support vehicle of reconnaissance corps when scouting with the lesser-firepower Sd.kfz 221 with only machine guns. The Chinese Sd.Kfz.222 is the early model; thus, it differs slightly from that of the German army's Sd.Kfz.222 in terms of tires and gun system.
