History of M5A1_(China): 
The ROCA acquired M3 Stuart tanks from the United States for the Burma Campaign against the Japanese during World War Two. The M3 Stuart's good handling and sufficient firepower to take down Japanese tanks meant that they played an important role within the armoured divisions of the ROCA. After the tides of the Chinese Civil War turned in favour of the PLA, many M3 Stuart were destroyed or captured by the communists. The M5A1 tanks left by US forces throughout the former Pacific Theatre became a supplement for the decreasing number of M3 Stuarts available to the ROCA. These leftover tanks were bought from the United States to help in the fight against the PLA. The exact detail of the deal was not recorded, it was only known that Chiang Ching-Kuo (蔣經國, son of Chiang Kai-Shek, second leader of Nationalist Taiwan before the end of martial law in late 1980s) handled this deal in 1947, later in 1948 Chiang Kai-Shek himself bought additional M5A1s and deployed them in Mainland China. Those spare tanks bought by Chiang Ching-Kuo were then shipped to Shanghai to assemble tanks with the spare parts. The 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment of the ROCA Armored Corps managed to assemble 24 M5A1s and these were soon shipped to Taiwan Island in view of the total lost of Mainland China [1]
