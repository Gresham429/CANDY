Description of M3A3_(1st_PTG)_(China): 
The M3A3 Stuart 1st Provisional Tank Group (1st PTG) is the premium third variant of the Light Tank M3 (Stuart) family. It features hull improvements inspired by the new Light Tank M5 (Stuart) family, which was developed from the Light Tank M3 (Stuart) family (the M3A2 Stuart was never produced). Other enhancements to the original M3 light tank included a turret with a rear overhang to accommodate the SCR-508 radio and a welded hull with sloping armour 20°from the vertical on the front and sides. During World War II, it was part of the Chinese-American 1st Provisional Tank Group of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces (中國遠征軍), where the Chinese Kuomintang government equipped 48 such tanks under the lend-lease program and established the first tank battalion under the "China-U.S. First Temporary Tank Group" stationed in India. This lesser-known battalion received little coverage while fighting in the China-Burma-India theatre (CBI).  While the U.S. Army Air Corps flew crucial supplies from India to China over the Himalayas, the 1st Provisional Tank Group helped the Allies reopen the land route through Japanese-occupied Burma by securing and repairing the Ledo-Burma Road.
