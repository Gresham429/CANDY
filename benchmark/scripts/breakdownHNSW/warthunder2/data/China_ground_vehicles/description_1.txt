Description of M8_LAC_(China): 
The M8 Greyhound Light Armoured Car (M8 LAC) was an armoured car developed by Ford Motor Company during World War II and primarily used by U.S. and British forces in Europe and the Pacific from 1943 until the end of the war. Many of the vehicles were provided to other countries for limited service, notably through the lend-lease program established by the U.S. during World War II. A few of these vehicles, likely used by US Army/USMC were captured in Mainland China in 1949 which one of them is still on display in the Chinese military museum; while additional vehicles were supplied to ROCA after their retreat and were not used during combat, as well as served as police riot-suppression vehicle.
