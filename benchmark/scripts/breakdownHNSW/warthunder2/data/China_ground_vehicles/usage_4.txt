Usage of Sd.Kfz.222_(China): 
The Sd.Kfz.222 is a fast vehicle capable of keeping up with the fastest of Rank I vehicles. This opens up numerous opportunities for you, as unlike the Flakpanzer I or the Flakpanzer 38, you are not nearly as vulnerable to gunner snipes as you would be with them. In addition, you are not nearly as well suited for AA work as you only have room for a maximum of 9 magazines (including the one you have loaded), so prolonged AA work will simply burn your ammunition long before the Flakpanzers even needed to start getting worried. The closest analogue one can compare the 222 to is the Sd.Kfz.234/1 (basically a Puma chassis with the same turret). Instead of shooting planes, one can actively use the 222 as a speedier version of the Pz.II, attacking enemy tanks. Your lack of armour and excellent speeds encourage flanking or ambushing roles. Remember enemy weak spots and avoid armour you can't handle.
