History of ISU-152_(China): 
Although it was deemed that the ISU-152 (aka Ëãè-152; the letter I was omitted in PLAGF naming) was a tank destroyer from a decade ago, it still had a 152 mm ML-20S howitzer as its main weapon, which could serve as mobile artillery platform and destroy enemies fortification as it did during WWII. A few dozens of ISU-152 were transferred from the Soviet Army after they had retreated from Dalian among with SU-100s and T-34/85s. Due to the lack of records, the only known case of ISU-152 in operation was during a military exercise in the mid-1960s. The remaining records claimed that both ISU-122/152 were used until 1970s.[1]
