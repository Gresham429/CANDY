Usage of LVT(A)(4)_(ZiS-2): 
The LVT(A)(4) (ZiS-2) is a fragile tank with a strong bite. The main gun is a very powerful Soviet ZiS-2 that have no problem penetrating through the hardest of enemies at its BR. Despite its size, it has great manoeuvrability that works on most terrain. Its high profile makes it a easy target for enemies to spot from afar and behind objects, fences and hills. The LVT(A)(4)'s thin hull armour makes it vulnerable to machine gun and autocannon fire. This makes Self Propelled Anti-Air vehicles and vehicles with 20 mm automatic cannons a lethal enemy, and large calibre guns with HEAT and HE can easily penetrate the thin armour and overpressure the LVT(A)(4).
