History of M3A3_Stuart_(China): 
The M3A3 Stuart was a substantially exported tank from the United States. Due to its proven capabilities in all theatres of the Second World War, it found itself on the battlefields of Eastern Asia. The Republic of China were supplied with over one thousand M3A3 Stuarts, making them a prolific user of the Stuart.[1] Some tanks during the late war use were retrofitted with light up-armour packages to further protect the front and sides of the tank thus extending its service life.[1] By 1946, the Kuomintang Armoured Corps were still operating at least 116 Stuart light tanks.[2]
