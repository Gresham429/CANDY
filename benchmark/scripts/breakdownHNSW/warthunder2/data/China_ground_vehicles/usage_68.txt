Usage of ZTZ99-II: 
Thanks to the technological advancements of the early 2000s, the ZTZ99-II shares a similar FCS to its (tech tree) predecessor ZTZ96A with variable 6x-11x magnification for the gunner's optics, and up to 10.7x magnification for the CITV, both equipped with TVD. This helps with engaging targets over ridge lines- commander override is a viable choice in case of long-range engagement. Thanks to its powerful 12V150HB engine, the ZTZ99 can accelerate fast enough to follow the team or alternatively, go to mid-field sniping positions. The laser warning system and high-quality thermal sights for the commander give the ZTZ99 a large degree of situational awareness, allowing enemies to be spotted and engaged quickly.
