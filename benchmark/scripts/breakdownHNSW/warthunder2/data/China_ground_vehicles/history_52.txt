History of CM11: 
In 1980, the Republic of China (ROC), also known as Taiwan, created the Armoured Vehicle Development Center. It was created partially to develop the CM-11 tank. The Republic of China Army (ROCA) needed a 2nd generation main battle tank (MBT), and they wanted to acquire one without breaking any limitations placed on the ROC by the US-PRC Joint Communique. As such, they decided to create a hybrid design using the M48A3 turret and the M60A3 hull. In the ROC, it is known as the CM-11 Brave Tiger, whereas the United States designated it as the M48H for "M48 Hybrid". To create the tank, the ROC imported M60A3 hulls from the United States along with M68A1 105 mm cannons and M48A3 turrets, and commander cupolas from Israel. Two prototypes were finished in 1988 and the ROCA ordered 450 CM-11 tanks.
