Usage of ZTZ99A: 
As the spearhead of the current PLAGF armoured corps, thanks to the vastly improved mobility compared to its predecessors and new technologies integrated onto ZTZ99A, it has better handling than its predecessors and is comparable to NATO vehicles in terms of its power-to-weight ratio and top speed. The newly designed tank also has very similar protection to its predecessors while parts of its turrets are replaced by brand new FY-5 ERA blocks and the top is covered by FY-1DA ERA blocks, improving its survivability against top-down attacks. However, the mantlet is still lightly protected compared to other MBTs at its rank, a penetrating shot is now even more likely to cause a breech knockout or even lethal damage to the gun crews. In terms of the hull, although it was remarked to have the protection of a ZTZ99 and the driver has been moved to the left side, the age-old problem of a huge LPF and less protected area over the driver can certainly ruin a player's day at top tier. So it is better to keep the ZTZ99A away from heated battlefields or make sure to cover the LFP and mantlet as much as possible. In case of complicated terrains, either avoid them or quickly dig for cover with the dozer blade modification.
