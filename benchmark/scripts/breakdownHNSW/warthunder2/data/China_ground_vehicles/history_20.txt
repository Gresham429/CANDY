History of T-34_(1943)_(China): 
In Soviet official documents, little difference was made between the T-34 Model 1942 (German designation T-34/76C) and the T-34 Model 1943 (German designations T-34/76D, E and F); most of the differences between the models were because they were produced at different facilities.
