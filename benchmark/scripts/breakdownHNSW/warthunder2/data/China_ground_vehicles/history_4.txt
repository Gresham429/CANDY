History of Sd.Kfz.222_(China): 
By the decade of 1930s, for the need to import tungsten and seek for opening the arms market in China, the Nationalist Government purchased 22 Sd.kfz.221 series (twelve Sd.kfz. 221, six Sd.kfz. 222 and four Sd.kfz. 223 respectively) from the Third Reich as part of the modernization attempt for the NRA before the 2nd Sino-Japanese War broke. These vehicles were delivered in two batches in 1936; unlike the standard (late) version in Wehrmacht service, NRA's Sd.kfz.222, the weaponry was downgraded to earlier series with Kwk 30 autocannon and a RHS MG13 machine gun, as well as conventional tires instead of crossroad tires. These 22 vehicles were also the foundation of NRA's armored reconnaissance corps thanks to having radio for every vehicle which were all delivered to the 3rd Company, Reconnaissance Regiment, NRA Armored Corps (later NRA 200th Division). They were usually deployed to the battlefield according to the purpose and intensity of battle, where normally a duo of 221 and 222 would compose a recon platoon in combat area.
