Description of Type_69: 
The Type 69(Chinese: 69式中型坦克; industry code WZ121) was the first batch of 100 tanks manufactured as the domestic replacement of the previous Type 59 tanks with some parts of the domestic upgrades inspired from Soviet T-62. The plans to built a completely domestic tank rose after the worsen Sino-Soviet relationship, in fact the new tank was proposed in 1963 to replace the aforementioned Type 59 and the development started in 1965; while the later Cultural Revolution hindered the development severely, Chinese engineers eventually acquired the No. 545 T-62 from Soviet Border Troops and many parts of the most advanced Soviet tank known to Chinese inspired the engineers to revise their designs. The WZ121 eventually passed for certification in 1974 with new diesel engine, FCS and the infamous 100 mm smoothbore cannon; due to the rather disappointing performance of the cannon and flaws found during trials, these 100 tanks were soon returned to Factory 617 with the only known surviving tank stored in China Tank Museum (now closed), where the new Type 69-II with rifled 100 mm cannon passed as the true Type 69 in service, as well as the bestseller of Chinese medium tanks during 1980s as the Type 69-IIa.
