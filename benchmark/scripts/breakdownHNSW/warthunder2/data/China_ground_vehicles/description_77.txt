Description of ZTZ99A: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 99A (Chinese: ZTZ99A式主战坦克; industry code WZ1001; erroneously known as ZTZ99A2 before official ratification in the late 2010s) currently serves as the spearhead of the PLAGF armored corps and has been their most advanced tank since the 2010s. The plans for a true 3rd generation MBT emerged during the development of the WZ123 program, as the PLAGF recognized the need for a new tank capable of effectively countering NATO and Russian tanks in the future. This led to the initiation of the WZ1001 program, which aimed to equip the new tank with advanced features such as a new smoothbore gun, FCS, and powerplant by the early 2000s. Through a series of prototype iterations, one particular design from the WZ1001 program emerged as the chosen configuration for the new MBT. It was officially named ZTZ99A and made its first appearance during the VJ Day parade in September 2015. The ZTZ99A has become an iconic piece of equipment for the PLAGF, representing a departure from the low-profile design of previous tanks.
