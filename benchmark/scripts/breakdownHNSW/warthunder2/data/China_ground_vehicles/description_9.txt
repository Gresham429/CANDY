Description of M5A1_(China): 
The M5A1 Stuart is the second variant of the Light Tank M5 Stuart family, which shares many similarities with the Light Tank M3 Stuart family. To respond to the wartime shortage of the radial aero-engines used in the M3 light tanks, a new version with twin Cadillac V8 engines and dual Hydra-Matic gearboxes functioning through a transfer case was designed. The Chinese Nationalist Army initially received the M5A1 Stuart from the U.S. forces in 1948. In the three major battles of the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Nationalist Army was defeated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with its armoured divisions captured or wiped out. Following the Huai Hai campaign, the Chinese Nationalist Army Armored Command began the process of rebuilding its armoured divisions. Since the U.S. Army abandoned numerous tanks in the Philippines, Guam, and Okinawa after World War II, Jiang Weiguo, chief of staff of the Chinese Nationalist Army Armored Command, negotiated with the U.S. to purchase these tanks. The rebuilt tank battalions went out to find useable tanks and parts, which were then repaired and reassembled. The first battalion of the third tank regiment managed to assemble 22 M5A1 tanks and divide them into two companies.
