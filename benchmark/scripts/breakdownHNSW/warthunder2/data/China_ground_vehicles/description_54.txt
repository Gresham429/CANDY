Description of ZTZ88B: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 88B (Chinese: ZTZ88B式主战坦克; industry code WZ122E) belongs to the WZ122 family of MBTs and is the first mass-produced variant of the ZTZ80/88 series. The WZ122 series traces back to the Object 122, which emerged after Chinese engineers embarked on a campaign to develop new armoured vehicles for the PLAGF in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Although the program was canceled after direction changes, one of its prototypes, WZ1225, made it to PLAGF evaluation and was later designated as the PLAGF's new 2nd generation MBT, retaining its industry code WZ122. The tank was first manufactured as the ZTZ80-I for evaluation, and with a need for new MBTs and the 3rd generation MBT (Project 784; later renamed WZ123 and ZTZ99) still being in development, the a fusion of the hull of the ZTZ85 and the turret of the ZTZ80-I later joined the PLAGF as the ZTZ88B and was first shown during 50th National Day Parade.
