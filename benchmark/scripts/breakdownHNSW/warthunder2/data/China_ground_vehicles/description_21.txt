Description of M4A1_(75)_W_(China): 
The ‚êóMedium Tank M4A1 (75) W Sherman is a unique Sherman variant due to its nature as a retrofitted tank using parts of different models of M4 Shermans. In this case, these were the six Sherman tanks with the cast hull of the M4A1 (76) W (distinguished by the travel lock of the original 76 mm M1 gun) and its iconic D82081 (full-sized mantlet) turret, but only armed with a less powerful 75 mm M3 cannon. These tanks were part of the post-Civil War order of supplementary tanks for the ROCA from Great Britain, delivered in late 1949 after the loss of most of Mainland China. As the ROCA later adopted M18 GMC as their main tank, these Shermans were soon retired in 1952.
