History of ZTZ96A_(P): 
The overall information on this failed design on upgrading the later ZTZ96s with new appliqué armour was minimal; both ZTZ96A (WZ122R) were designed in the early 2000s in view of an upgrade scheme for later ZTZ96s in production line. While both tanks retained the same firepower and mobility, as well as a pair of Shtora-1-like IR jammers known as JD-3 developed domestically on the side of the turret (some suggest that JD-3 was based on the Ukrainian's Shtora-1 equivalent model of IR jammer), they have a very different turret designs, where this design has a pair of wedge blocks of appliqué armour in the front of the turret.
