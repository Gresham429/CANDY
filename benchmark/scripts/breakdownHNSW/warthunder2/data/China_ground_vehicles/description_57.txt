Description of PGZ09: 
The HuoPao GaoShe ZiXing 09 (Chinese: PGZ09式自行高射炮; industry code WA3001) has been in PLAGF service since the late 2000s, alongside previous systems and SAM systems for field and infrastructure defense. The Oerlikon KDA (GDF-001) was introduced to Mainland China during the late 1980s and was licensed to be built domestically in 1990 as the PG90. With the introduction of AHEAD ammunition for the 35 mm autocannons by the mid-2000s, there were also plans to built a new SPAAG with such capabilities on a variety of chassis ranging from wheeled APC to the latest artillery chassis; alternative plans to introduce the 2S6 Tunguska were also proposed. The prototype using the latest artillery chassis eventually won the bidding; although there were plans to install SAMs on the sides, the finalized prototype only has a new FCS installed and the armament consisted of only a pair of 35 mm autocannons.
