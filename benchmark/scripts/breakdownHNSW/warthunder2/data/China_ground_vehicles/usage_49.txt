Usage of Type_69-IIa: 
Players who own a T-55A or Type 69 will get used to the Type 69-IIa very quickly as both of them share many features including a two-plane stabilizer and very similar appearance. The distinctive cage armour is mostly there for appearances but still offers some protection against small HEAT rounds. Other than that, most of its performance is identical to Type 69 aside from being a bit heavier; the overall mobility is identical though. Do note that the overall turret traverse speed is still not as fast as its NATO competitors, so be extra careful in close-quarters brawling; being prepared for any situation is the key to utilising the Type 69-IIa. Although it doesn't have the 3D3 smoke shell at disposal, it does comes with 8 smoke grenades with 2 shots per round which can mitigate the problem.
