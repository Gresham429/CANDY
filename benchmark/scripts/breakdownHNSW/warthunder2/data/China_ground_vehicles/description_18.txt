Description of Object_211: 
The Object 211 is a prototype designed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the late 1950s to produce an effective amphibious tank. By 1957, the structure of the Chinese People's Liberation Army had been revised, and the Chinese Marines were integrated into the Chinese Army. The southeast coastal areas remained unstable as the Chinese Nationalist Army in Taiwan, led by the Kuomintang, has not abandoned the goal of "counterattacking the mainland." Since Southern China is mountainous and has a lot of rice fields with water networks and rivers, it was considered that medium and heavy tanks would be unsuitable and amphibious vehicles would play an indispensable role during defence. In July 1958, a development code called "Project 211" was assigned, and China purchased the Soviet Union's PT-76 amphibious tank to acquire the technologies. The program initially encountered various challenges due to the Chinese tank industry's inadequate technologies at the time, primarily as a result of World War II and the Civil War. Nonetheless, by the early 1960s, the program had proven to be a success, and it was ready for production as the Type 63 amphibious light tank. The model in-game represented the 4th prototype with new Type 62 85 mm cannon now displayed at Block 4 of family housings at Institute 201 (aka China North Vehicle Research Institute, 中国北车研究所).
