Description of ZTZ59D1: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 59D1 (Chinese: ZTZ59D1式中型坦克; industry code WZ120C) is the proof-of-concept of what would later become the ZTZ59D in PLAGF service. Although PLAGF has already upgraded some of their fleet of Type 59s with now-domestic 105 mm cannons, there were still plans to further upgrade its protection against enemies and its FCS at a more economic price, including FY-1/2 ERA for different types of threats and new digitalized FCS. The modified tanks, now under the designation of WZ120C passed for certifications in April 1995 with the technologies used on ZTZ59D aside from the main cannon. These tanks have been part of the PLAGF armored corps until they are eventually replaced by wheeled assault guns or ZTQ15 with overall superior performance.
