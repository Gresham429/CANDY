Usage of Type_59: 
The Type 59 is best used similarly to the original T-54. The vehicle's mobility is decent, but the turret's rotation speed and the gun's inclination's velocity are really bothering. For those not used to this vehicle, it is better not to rush straight into the combat zone. Instead, stay behind other teammates, keep an eye on the surroundings, and anticipate where enemies may appear. The vertical stabilizer, an oddity for a high-tier vehicle, is effective up to around 40 km/h, which is a major step up from the familiar vertical stabilizers used by the M4 Sherman family and practically equivalent to two-plane stabilizer under most circumstances since the Type 59 will typically only exceed 40 km/h when driving downhill or on roads. Still, the mediocre gun handling makes high-speed shooting risky, since the turret will struggle with the rapid aim adjustments required. The stabilizer is a significant advantage when fighting unstabilized tanks, since the gun does not need to settle before an accurate shot. The gun should be kept pointed towards possible enemy positions and when rapid adjustments in aim are needed, both the hull and the turret should be turned.
