History of CCKW_353_(M45): 
The GMC CCKW-353 was a 2 1/2 ton six-axle truck operated by the US and other Allied forces during WW2. It was the second most produced US truck, with only the MB Willy Jeep beating it in production numbers. The CCKW series as a whole had a wide array of variants and models produced, with over 520,000 units produced between 1940 and 1946. The Republic of China specifically would have the open cab CCKW-353 variant used in a wide variety of roles, from general transport, artillery towing, and fuel trucks, to mounting the M45 Quadmount in the rear bed as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun.
