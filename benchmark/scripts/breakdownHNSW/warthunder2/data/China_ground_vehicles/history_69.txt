History of ZTZ99-III: 
After the commission of ZTZ99-II (WZ123 or ZTZ99 Mod. 2003, 99一期改, ZTZ99 "二类定型状态" in game; erroneously known as 99G), Factory 617 kept on revising the design and eliminated some of its design flaws, such as replacing the bulged cast turret with a brand new welded turret, as well as re-positioning the existing applique armour of turret front and lengthening the side ones; the UFP was also redesigned to fit FY-4 in a more reasonable positioning. It was then finalized just a year later and in the 60th Anniversary of the Establishment of PRC in 2009, the new ZTZ99-III (WZ123B or ZTZ99 Mod. 2004, 99二期改, ZTZ99 "三类定型状态" in game; erroneously known as 99A1) showed up as the leading column of vehicle phalanx (numbered 01-01 to 01-18 from 334th Regiment, 112th Mechanized Infantry Brigade, 38th Army Corps), serving as the new spearhead of PLAGF elite armoured brigades.
