Usage of T-62_545_(China): 
The T-62 is similar to Chinese MBTs such as the Type 59 or the ZTZ59D1. As usual with Chinese MBTs, only the turret has armour to speak of. Do not let this put you off as the T-62's 115 mm U-5TS is a formidable cannon, capable of dealing with practically any tank it faces. This comes at the cost of a somewhat slower reload time of 12.0s (9.2s if maxed crew), which is below average for its BR. All in all, the T-62 will give Chinese tankers a general idea of how to play upcoming MBTs, as the playstyle doesn't change much. Outside of its slow reload it has excellent reactive mobility and armor while not nonexistent will generally not stop enemy shells - something that is more exemplified the higher up the tree you go.
