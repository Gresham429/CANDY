Description of VT-4A1: 
The VT-4A1 , previously known as MBT3000 during development, is one of the export MBTs produced by NORINCO as their high-end MBT solution to customers, where the A1 upgrade was first shown in 2022 Zhuhai Airshow in NORINCO's exhibition hall. After the development of Sino-Pakistani MBT2000 (Al-Khalid) in 2001, PLAGF's new 3rd Generation MBT were also in progress of development by early 2000s, thus plans for a completely domestic export MBT was suggested as Pakistan held half of the shares of any sales of MBT2000 as signed in a referendum. The original design of MBT3000 in 2009 planned for Ukrainian 6TD-2 engine pack, but threats from Ukroboronprom to not provide the necessary power packs (due to them also offering the T-84s to Peru, in competition with NORINCO's offering), meant that NORINCO has to source the components completely from NORINCO subsidies; thanks to the commission of ZTZ99A by 2010 and new full-electric gun laying system developed in 2000s, the new MBT3000 utilized a new power pack based on ZTZ99A; its prototype was completed by 2012 and the scaled mock-up was first shown in Eurosatory 2012,  then the prototype was first shown during an armored vehicle show day for military attach√© in Mainland China, then the Zhuhai Airshow of 2014 known as the VT-4. VT-4A1 introduced GL-6 hard-kill APS and a micro-drone for extra situational awareness, while VT-4 has been exported to Thailand, Pakistan (VT-4A; locally produced as Al-Haider) and Nigeria respectively, the VT-4A1 has yet to secure export orders.
