Description of ZLT11: 
The ZiXing LunShi Tanke 11, or by its more well-known pre-2012 codename "ZTL11"* (Simplified Chinese: ZLT11式105毫米轮式突击炮; lit. wheeled assault gun), is the Chinese equivalent to MGS units in US Army service and now being used as the quick response vehicle of PLAGF heavy composite mechanized brigades or PLANMC's amphibious brigades. As Mainland China was developing wheeled chassis for mechanization of PLAGF, NORINCO brought up their BK1970 and 1990 prototypes as a wheeled assault gun with varieties of drivetrains (6x6; 8x8); although the prototypes did not make into service, the concept of more advanced wheeled APC/IFV was approved and was first used on export "VN" series APCs with the VN1 as the 8x8 solution from NORINCO. After the development of ZTD05 (now ZLT05) and its turret systems, the turret was likely been reused on the project to produce new 8x8 assault guns for PLAGF troops after the certification of ZBL08 family; the new assault gun was certified in 2011 and made its first public appearance in 2015, where later batches received AMT transmissions. All ZLT11 is currently in service with PLAGF and been exported to different African countries under the name ST1 until the new 8x8 IFV family which was discovered in late-2010s gets certification by the 2020s.
