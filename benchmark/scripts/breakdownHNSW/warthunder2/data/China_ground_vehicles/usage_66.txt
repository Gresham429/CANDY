Usage of MBT2000: 
To put MBT2000 among its Chinese cousins or Eastern Bloc competitors, if these tanks are literary tractors, MBT2000 can be said as a Bugatti among these tanks in terms of mobility. It offers a very different approach from earlier Chinese design and now has equivalent mobility to some NATO MBTs albeit having lesser engine power, not only it has the top speed of a T-80U, it also has neutral steering and unprecedented reverse speed on any Warsaw-Pact/PLAGF tanks at its era (-31 km/h, equivalent to Leopard 2A4); this enables MBT2000 as a flanker to enemy defense lines, but players still have to take extra caution on its protection and not being hit as much as possible.
