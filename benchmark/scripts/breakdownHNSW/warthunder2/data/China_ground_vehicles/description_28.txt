Description of Type_62: 
The Type 62 light tank (62式轻坦), developed and produced by China North Industries Corporation, is a Chinese light tank developed in the early 1960s that is based on the Chinese Type 59 medium tank with a reduced main gun calibre, lighter armour, and a smaller suite of electronics and other equipment designed to reduce weight. The Chinese Type 62 tank was conceptualized in 1958, finalized in 1962, and put into production and service in 1963. It is primarily utilized by armoured divisions in China's southern region, where the environment is rocky and mountainous. The Type 63 light tank is mainly used for critical tasks such as reconnaissance, infantry support, and combat against enemy lightly armoured vehicles. The Type 62 light tank has a total combat weight of 21 tons and can withstand most machine guns and close-blast shell fragments. A total of around 1,500 tanks had been constructed by the time production ceased in 1989.
