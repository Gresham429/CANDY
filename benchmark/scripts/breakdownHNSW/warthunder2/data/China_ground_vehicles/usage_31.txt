Usage of IS-2_(China): 
As the tank's design purpose suggests, the IS-2 is a heavy tank built with an emphasis on engaging hostile armoured vehicles as well as a breakthrough tank. The tank's heavy armour retains the similar properties of the IS-1 and KV line of battle-tanks but introduces some sloped armour on the front plate and turret mantlet. It is armed with a powerful but slow reloading 122 mm D-25T cannon, mimicking that of the two Soviet assault guns, the ISU-152 and ISU-122 at around the mid-20 seconds. Nevertheless, its gun will commonly destroy almost all but the most heavily armoured vehicles with a single shot. At the IS-2's battle rating, the armour no longer stands up to much punishment with the advent of opponents with more powerful weaponry, and caution should be taken. Close-quarters combat and brawling against more than one target at a time is highly discouraged due to the long reload speed unless the tank operator is trapped and situation requires this as an absolute necessity. Alternatively, if escorted and accompanied by other friendly tanks, the IS-2 can be supplemented and perform better in dire close-quarters situations.
