History of M8_LAC_(China): 
During World War 2, more than 1,000 M8 armoured cars were lend-leased to the Allies, including Free France and Brazil. After WW2, the US Foreign Military Assistance Program donated surplus cars to the United States Constabulary in various Western European and Asian nations. French Forces noted usage of this car, and during the Korean and Vietnam War, both Viet Cong and Chinese got their hands on it as well, but the Korean Army was the primary user, who then donated them to the Vietnamese. Belgium also used these cars as part of NATO, and in UN forces sent to peacekeeping operations in the Congo. M8s are still in service in Columbia, Guatemala, Peru, and Paraguay.
