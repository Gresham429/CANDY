Usage of T-26_(China): 
It is recommended to play the T-26 in a support role, flanking the battlefield and finding a good position to support your teammates from. The 45 mm cannon has very good characteristics with its rounds (APHEBC, AP) being able to deal a fair amount of damage to enemy vehicles from both short and long-range. The fast reload allows for quick adjustment of aim between shots, meaning the T-26 can be a highly effective flanking vehicle if a good camping spot is found. The limited gun depression however, (-6Â°) will affect which positions are usable. Keeping back at long-range is certainly an effective way to avoid taking damage.
