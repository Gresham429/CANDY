Usage of ZTZ96: 
Like preceding Chinese MBTs, the ZTZ96 is not suited for rapid assaults due to its substandard mobility and should be played conservatively. Let speedier teammates charge first into combat while you cover them and move to good overwatch positions. Situational awareness is key since faster opponents may arrive earlier and the tank lacks thermal sights. The gun handling is a bit better than contemporary Soviet MBTs but it still has a slow vertical traverse speed. The ZTZ96's composite armour is not amazing but still enough to shrug off some incoming fire, and staying close to cover is helpful. Try to hide the lower glacis since that is the ZTZ96's most dangerous weak spot. The ZTZ96's extra two degrees of gun depression compared to previous PRC tanks are helpful for peeking over small hills. Be on the lookout for flankers since the ZTZ96 has weaker side armour than Soviet tanks and 25-30 mm IFV autocannons can penetrate it.
