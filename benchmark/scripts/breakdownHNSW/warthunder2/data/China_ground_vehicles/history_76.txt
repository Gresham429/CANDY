History of VT-4A1: 
Soon after the development of Sino-Pakistani MBT2000 and its debut in 2001, the engineer team of MBT2000 kept on improving their tank design with provisions of future battlefield; a major problem rose up during the development of MBT2000 - namely the powerplant. Recalling from the development history of MBT2000, due to the sanctions to Mainland China and Pakistan in 1990s, as well as inferior transmission systems, MBT2000 has to source from Ukraine with their 6TD-2 engine pack.  This eventually led to a controversary between Mainland China and Ukraine during the MBT bidding of Peru in 2009, as Ukroboronprom threated not to supply 6TD-2 to MBT2000 production line in favor for the T-84 with identical powerplant (note: Peru eventually opted for T-55M8A2 Tif√≥n 2; the country received four MBT2000 for evaluation but were later returned to NORINCO); all sales profits of MBT2000 from NORINCO would also be divided with Pakistan as both countries hold half of the shares and intellectual property of the tank. Thus the need for a completely domestic MBT rose.
