Description of PTZ89: 
The HuoPao Tanke ZiXing 89 (Chinese: PTZ89式坦克歼击车), known among Chinese military enthusiasts as the "Eastern Ferdinand" (东方费迪南) due to its shape and heavy firepower, was likely the last gun-based tank destroyer ever produced, part of the PLAGF modernization program in the late 1980s aimed at countering the menacing Soviet forces. The 120 mm smoothbore cannon can be traced back to the Project 122, which originated from the PLAGF's requirement for a high-calibre gun capable of neutralizing Soviet tanks in the Far East. Although previous attempts faced technological challenges and the introduction of NATO-calibre guns, Chinese engineers eventually developed a new 120 mm cannon as part of the WZ123 (ZTZ99) program. This was tested against a reverse-engineered 2A46M gun from an Object 172M-1 E-4 (T-72U or Type 64 六四型), with the latter being selected. In order to preserve their efforts and enhance firepower against waves of Soviet armoured units, the 120 mm gun was incorporated into a new mobile gun platform on the WZ321 chassis for the PLAGF. This platform, known as the PTZ89, featured an autoloader to maximize firepower during potential defensive operations. Although introduced at a time when it was already considered obsolete, the PTZ89 remained in service until 2015, its retirement officially marking the end of gun-based tank destroyers.
