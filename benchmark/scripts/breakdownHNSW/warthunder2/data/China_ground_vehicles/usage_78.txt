Usage of Tor-M1: 
As the long-awaited long-range SPAA for Chinese TT players, Tor-M1 also introduces some unique features from its counterparts in different countries- the most iconic feature is the unique cold-launch VLS cells onboard that ejects the missile vertically, which then turns and ignites its motor from a safe distance. While players can enjoy the aesthetic feature of the Tor-M1, this also means that it has a minimal firing range unlike its counterparts with "direct-fire" SAMs: a 1 km dead zone around the vehicle that can be embarrassing when aircraft show up in the radius at tree-top altitude on very rare occasions. Do remember that Tor is not an SPAAG with guns, so players used to the PGZ04A will need to make extra sure nothing comes too close to handle; teaming up with friendly SPAA armed with cannons or "direct-fire" missiles is also viable for better efficiency. Though the high elevation of the sight can make sure targets that are high overhead (anywhere before 75°) will face a miserable end thanks to the radar system. The other feature of the Tor-M1 is the capability of TWS with up to 2 tracked targets. If there are multiple targets within a 15°x15° scan zone of the radar, locking the other target via the "Select Radar/IRST target to lock on" button after a missile has been launched will cause the missile to become guided by the radar towards the originally locked target, allowing the new target to be engaged simultaneously by manual guidance. Depending on the desired accuracy of acquisition, changing the scanning pattern of the radar may be necessary for targets at different altitudes at the cost of additional scans required to detect higher targets.
