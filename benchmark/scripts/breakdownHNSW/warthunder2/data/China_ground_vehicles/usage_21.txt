Usage of M4A1_(75)_W_(China): 
Similar to the other 75 mm Shermans, the M4A1 (75) W has a good gun that can take out most opponents even when uptiered. The tank can handle itself against enemies, but it's never a problem to work with your team in it, cover your allies when they are moving forward. The M4A1 (75) W's vertical stabilizer allows it to aim during stops or at low speed, providing a major advantage in engagements with other medium tanks, though other Shermans and some US and British tanks also have access to one. While rival M4 tanks would not be a threat to a seasoned player, they can prove a nuisance to beginners.
