History of ZLT11: 
Back in the 1990s, Mainland China was in need for a new wheeled APC family, with either 6x6 or 8x8 chassis. Among the 3 companies in competition, Factory 256 (NORINCO Chongqing Tiema) finalised their WZ551 6x6 design which was designed in the mid-1980s, and it was successfully commissioned under the name ZSL92 (and later PTL02/WMA301 assault gun). While Factory 617 (NORINCO Inner Mongolia First Machinery) had themselves built a 6x6 assault gun under their factory codename BK1970, and later BK1990 with an 8x8 drivetrain, these designs didn't make it into service, but the experience gained in the process helped Factory 617 develop a new APC with a brand new transmission system. Later, in the 2000s, the designs were accepted by PLAGF and were approved for further development.[1]
