Usage of AFT09: 
Players of VAB MEPHISTO will soon find themselves home as AFT09 shared a very similar config of missile launcher and chassis; both vehicles are 4Ã—4 and have a retractable launcher with 4 missiles. The HJ-9 is much deadlier than the HOT-2 however, with twice the flight speed, 25% greater raw penetration, and a tandem warhead, allowing players to be more aggressive. The AFT09 shares a similar chassis with the PTL02, but thanks to its relatively lighter weight, it has a higher top speed than the latter and a slightly faster reverse speed; although this might not sound like much for such a lightly-protected vehicle, the mobility is enough to take advantageous positions before most enemies can. Be ready to counter enemy assaults or retreat as soon as the tides have turned, as the AFT09 takes a while to reload and has a poor reverse speed. Do remember that the overall protection of it is only rated for rifle-caliber bullets, anything larger is like a hot knife through butter, therefore cover and stealth are the most essential element to ensure the overall survival of the vehicle. Be especially careful of vehicles with top-attack missiles such as the M3A3 Bradley because they can very easily destroy the AFT09 behind cover. The number of smoke grenades on the vehicle might be low, but it is still enough for a retreat or two.
