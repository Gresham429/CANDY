Description of T-62_545_(China): 
After the worsening of the Sino-Soviet relationship and further escalation of the threat of nuclear strikes, the armed conflict between two countries finally broke out on Damansky/Zhenbao Island on the Ussuri River. On March 15th, 1969, T-62 â„–545 crossed the frozen Ussuri River to assault the island, but it was disabled by Chinese artillery and mines, forcing the crews to abandon the vehicle alongside their commander. After artillery wars to gain control of the vehicle, the Soviets sank the tank with artillery fire. A month later, the PLAGF recovered the tank with the help of PLAN divers, and it was sent to Beijing for further evaluations.
