Description of M24_(China): 
The M24 Chaffee (formally Light Tank, M24) is a U.S. light tank that served during World War II; it was also used in post-war wars such as the Korean War and by the French in the War in Algeria and the First Indochina War. Under World War II's lend-lease program, a small number of M24 light tanks were shipped to China for the Chinese Nationalist Army. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, U.S. President Truman declared military aid to Taiwan. The United States exported 295 M18 tank destroyers in 1952, followed by 289 M24 light tanks. This late World War II tank gradually became obsolete during the Cold War era; therefore, different modifications were performed to make it combat-ready in Taiwan. During the late 1900s, Taiwan had a maximum of roughly 325 tanks in service.
