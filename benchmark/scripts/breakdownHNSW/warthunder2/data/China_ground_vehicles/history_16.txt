History of M3A3_(1st_PTG)_(China): 
The Chinese Expeditionary Forces (中國遠征軍) were among one of the most famous unit in the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theatre of WW2. Soon after the total outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War (抗日戰爭) in 1937, and the later Southbound assault by the Imperial Japanese Forces in December 1941, the major blood line of the ROC at that time was the Burma Road (滇緬公路). It was still under construction and would certainly become a target of the Japanese forces. On 1941/12/23, the Sino-British Joint Defense Agreement on Burma Road (中英共同防禦滇緬路協定) was signed, leading to the establishment of the Expeditionary Forces to defend this vital supply line.
