History of WZ305: 
In the 1980s, Iraq requested that China make a copy of the ZSU-57-2 and provided a few examples of the Soviet SPAAG for reverse engineering. China had not previously imported or used the ZSU-57-2. However, a local copy of the ZSU's gun was available. The result of the project was the Type 80 SPAAG, sometimes known by its industrial designation of WZ305. Designed on the chassis of the Type 69-II medium tank, the Type 80 was very similar to the ZSU-57-2, featuring twin 57 mm cannons in an open topped turret with no fire control systems, limiting it to clear weather anti-aircraft use. A proximity-fused round was later developed that improved its utility.
