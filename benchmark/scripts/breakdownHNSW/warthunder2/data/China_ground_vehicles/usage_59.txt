Usage of PTZ89: 
The selling point of the PTZ89 is its ability to sling very powerful APFSDS downrange at a very rapid pace. If a target is in the gunner's sight, cleaning them up is easy. The challenge is getting into a situation to use that firepower; the PTZ89 is easy to spot, not particularly fast, and horribly protected, so any enemy that sees the PTZ89 can easily send it back to the hangar. IFVs and SPAAs are perhaps the biggest threat to the PTZ89 since, unlike MBTs, they can afford to start sending dozens of rounds downrange at first sight instead of needing to carefully lay their gun on target, reducing the window of time available for a preemptive shot. The M3 Bradley's relatively small 25 mm autocannon, which can hardly scratch the paint off the ZTZ59D1's armour, will turn the PTZ89 into a colander.
