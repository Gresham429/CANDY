History of M60A3_TTS_(China): 
The August 17 Communiqu√© (The Announcement by China and the United States on Solving the Issue of US Arms Sales to Taiwan) signed by the PRC and the United States restricted the United States' sales of military equipment to Taiwan not exceeding the technology level of the 1980s. At that time, it was not possible for the ROC army to equip with new American-made MBTs in the close future. However, in August 1994, the US government agreed to sell 160 second-hand M60A3TTS main battle tanks to Taiwan, and in May 1996 approved the contract for a second batch of additional 300 tanks. These M60A3TTS MBTs were delivered around the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, and this move undoubtedly contained the PRC's further attempts to invade Taiwan by force.
