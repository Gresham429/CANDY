Usage of Object_211: 
As the project number and its design suggests, Object 211 is what set the foundations for the ZTS63 family which was PLA's weapon of choice when crossing battlefields with extensive water networks. As there was no need for an amphibious tank with crew compartments, the overall size could be further shrunken to an even small size. The turret design be reminiscent of the Type 62's oval shape turret, but the Object 211's is even smaller: enemy tanks very unlikely to find the 211 while hiding in vegetation. The size and function also means that the protection will not be anywhere near normal non-amphibious light tanks: the overall protection is only rated for .50 calibre at most, skirt heated frontlines and avoid any vehicles with autocannons at all costs as the 211 will meet its end rather quickly. Be sure to keep the crew alive as much as possible, since it has a 3 men crew rather than 4 in Type 62 or 63; although it is more likely that the Object will be knocked out by enemy shells right away, any reduction on crew also further lowers its combat capability. The major problem goes to the turret traverse, this turret with a 85 mm cannon turns extremely slowly, so be prepared to turn the turret beforehand for maximum reaction time.
