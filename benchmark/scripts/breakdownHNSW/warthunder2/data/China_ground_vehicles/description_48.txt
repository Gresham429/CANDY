Description of ZTZ59A: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 59A (Chinese: [ZTZ]59A式中型坦克 or 59-I式中型坦克; industry code WZ120A) was the first major revision for the Type 59 in PLAGF service. The plans for this revision was based on the suggestions gathered from the armored corps during the Sino-Vietnamese War to upgrading the existing fleet with new FCS and suspensions before the later 59-II (59B) with 105 mm gun could enter service; the upgrades included IR searchlight, LRF and new FCS with automatic ballistic solutions for faster acquisition, side fences and smoke grenade launchers by the turret, as well as new APFSDS for better penetration. The upgraded tank was certified in 1984 and became the placeholder upgrades during the modernization of PLA.
