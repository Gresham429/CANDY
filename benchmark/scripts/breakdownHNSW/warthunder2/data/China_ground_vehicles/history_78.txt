History of Tor-M1: 
The Soviet Army developed a complete and extensive field air defense network to repel possible oncoming air assaults from their enemies, with a great variety of missile systems for short-range defense. Although there are SA-8 Gecko/9K33 Osa systems for the army, the Soviet Armed Force still requested a successor to the 9K33 system with land/sea-based systems for different platforms, tackled by the joint efforts of Antey, Fakel and Altair (now part of the Almaz-Antey). After extensive tests under the restrictions from the armed forces and the use of their latest electronics including PESA radar, the ground-based version Tor (9K330) entered service in March 1986. The -M1 variant (9K331) was a further improvement for the system including the capability of attacking 2 targets simultaneously, revised missiles, new FCS, as well as new electronics for complicated battlefields with electronic interferences. The new system joined the Soviet Army in 1991.
