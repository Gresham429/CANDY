Description of IS-2_No.402: 
The IS-2 No.402 is a special IS-2 heavy tank of historical significance during the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War. In November 1951, the IS-2 No.402 took part in the Battle of Ma Liangshan against enemy fortifications. Given the battlefield's rough terrain, the Chinese heavy artillery could not effectively engage the enemy fortifications. The IS-2 No.402 was used as an assault gun, engaging and destroying enemy fortifications with high-explosive shells. In that battle, the IS-2 No.402 destroyed 6 enemy fortifications (British), boosting the morale of the19th Infantry Division it was supporting. The second-class medal of merit was awarded to all crew members.
