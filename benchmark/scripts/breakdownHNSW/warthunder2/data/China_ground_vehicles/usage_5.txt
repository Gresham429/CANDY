Usage of M8_HMC_(China): 
In general, the M8 Scott plays like a beefed-up M5A1. Being based on the same chassis, the massive increase in gun calibre and destructive potential means that enemies the light tank previously had difficulty destroying can now be dealt with more easily. One strategy is to push for the capture point and take it immediately using the high speed the chassis is capable of reaching. Once the capture point is held, find a good hull-down position and use the 75 mm HEAT to destroy any and all oncoming tanks.
