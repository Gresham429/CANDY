Description of ZTZ96: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 96 (Chinese: ZTZ96式主战坦克; industry code WZ122H) is one of the MBTs in PLAGF service since late 1990s. After the introduction of ZTZ88 by early 1990s, there were plans to fuse the hull of ZTZ88 with the successful turret from Type 85-IIM exported to Pakistan with domestic FCS. The development of such tank went on successfully as the WZ122H in PLAGF service and it has humbly served the PLAGF for almost 3 decades and possibly received upgrades to current standards due to being unable to upgrade from older tanks to the new ZTZ96A in service with ERA packages.
