Description of T-69_II_G: 
The Medium Tank T-69 II G is a Bangladeshi upgrade to their fleet of T-69 tanks (Type 69-IIM, industry code WZ121H), most likely inspired by the modifications performed by Pakistan as the Type 69-IIMA (WZ121K); these tanks underwent upgrades sometime between 2007 and 2009 with a new long-barrel 105 mm cannon, ERA packages on both the UFP and turret and likely FCS upgrades, especially for the optics. The tank was first seen in 2009 during the BDR mutiny. The upgrade served as an economic alternative to extend the service life of the Type 69 tanks. Later these tanks supported the newly bought MBT2000 tanks before T-59G Dujoy (Invincible; দুর্জয়) or VT-5 joined the army.
