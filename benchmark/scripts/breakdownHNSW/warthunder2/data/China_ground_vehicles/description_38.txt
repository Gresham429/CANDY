Description of M64: 
The M64, also known as the M64 (Chinese: 六四式戰車), was an attempt to develop domestic tanks in Taiwan using parts from the M18 GMC and M42 Duster. In the 1970s, the previous fleet of M18 GMC tanks was ageing, and there was a lack of light tank replacements. To address this issue, the ROCA planned to create a hybrid tank using the hull of the M42 and the turret from the M18. The project was undertaken by a factory on the main island and resulted in the M64, in parallel with a domestic, reverse-engineered version of the M41, designated as the M65 (六五式戰車). A total of 42 tanks were converted into the M64 configuration. However, these tanks were never deployed during the height of the Taiwan Strait Crisis and were subsequently retired in the 1980s. Only a few of these tanks are preserved and exhibited by the ROC.
