Usage of QN506: 
As a Chinese light tank, the QN506 carries a variety of weapons to use in battles. The QN506 is a fairly effective vehicle when it comes to destroying enemy light tanks and helicopters without mercy. However, the QN itself is also very vulnerable to enemy fire due to its lacking armour and volatile ATGM launchers. The QN also struggles against MBTs at closer ranges, as almost no armament the QN has aside from the Fire-and-Forget QN502CDDs can reliably handle a T-72 or Leopard 2 from the front. Contrary to the expectations of many players, the QN506 does not have any meaningful advantage on hilly maps. The QN502CDDs can't lock enemy ground targets unless their hulls are mostly exposed, while the QN201DDs lack the penetration to reliably hurt enemy vehicles and the 30 mm cannon unable to depress past -5 degrees.
