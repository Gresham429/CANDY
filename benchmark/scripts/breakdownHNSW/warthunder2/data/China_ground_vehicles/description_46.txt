Description of WZ305: 
The Wu Zhuang 305, or the PGZ80 as it would have been designated by the PLAGF, was an SPAAG that was based on the design of the ZSU-57-2 but mounted on a ZTZ79 chassis. In the late 1970s, the PLAGF recognized the need for a new SPAAG, as they had an abundance of towed anti-aircraft guns but lacked self-propelled systems. The plans included reverse-engineering ZSU-23-4s exchanged from Egypt and developing their own domestic systems. Additionally, they aimed to create a SPAAG with a relatively high-calibre weapon for field air-defense. Chinese engineers likely acquired the ZSU-57-2 from either Vietnam or Egypt, and the twin-barrelled turret was finalized by the mid-1980s. However, due to its inferior performance against third-generation jets and the development of new domestic SPAA systems, the WZ305 never entered service with the PLAGF. Instead, it was exported to Middle Eastern countries.
