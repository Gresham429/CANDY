Description of M41A3_(China): 
The ␗M41A3, officially designated as M41A3戰車 or by its translated nickname 華克猛犬 (Walker Bulldog), was a light tank used by the ROCA and ROCMC from 1958 to 2022. The design concept of the M41 series was for improvements on close-quarter self-defense firepower while retaining mobility on the battlefield under the T41 program. While the tanks were produced during the Korean War, it was only until the Vietnam War when they were put in service. M41A3 was a modification of the older M41A1, equipped with a fuel-injected AOS 895-5 diesel engine which was received by the ROCA in 1958 as military aid to the heated Taiwan Strait frontline. They mostly served as the fire support vehicles for the outer islands and training vehicles for ROCA armored corps. Due to the aging and obsolete performance of Walker Bulldogs, ROCA upgraded 50 of these tanks with better hull condition to the M41D standard, while the remaining ones would serve until the 2020s when a fatal vehicle rollover accident accelerated the decommissioning of unconverted M41s, as well as replacing them with the CM32 series. The final vehicle was decommissioned at Armor Training Command, ROCA in Hsinchu on 25th February 2022.
