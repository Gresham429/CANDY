Usage of ZLT11: 
Speed is the ZLT11's best friend, being an 8x8 chassis, and thanks to a more powerful engine and revised transmission, it can reach a top speed of 100 km/h on road; alternatively the chassis has also designed for difficult terrains so it can still reach 40-50 km/h off road, just keep in mind that mud is always the enemy. Thanks to the pair of propellers behind the wheels and its acceptable weight, the vehicle is also amphibious, so in some maps you might be able to take a detour and strike the enemies with surprise. The protection up front is also sufficient to stop up to 30 mm autocannon APHE shells (aside from where the headlights are), which is a great improvement over PTL02.
