Description of CM11: 
The CM11, also known as the M48H (Hybrid) and commonly referred to as "勇虎" (Brave Tiger), has served as the MBT of the ROCA since the 1990s. The decision to acquire new tanks arose from the need to replace the ageing fleet of M48A1s. In the late 1980s, the ROCA purchased several hundred M60A3 TTS, and plans were made to upgrade the existing fleet of Pattons by utilizing spare hulls obtained from the United States. The result was a hybrid tank, combining an M60A3 hull, M48A5 turret, and an M1 Abrams-equivalent FCS. Additionally, some spare M48A5 turrets were mounted on a few dozen M48A1s, resulting in the CM12 variant. The initial batches of these hybrid tanks became the spearhead of the ROCA's armored corps, particularly intended to counter potential PLA landing operations. The CM11 has faithfully served for over three decades, but may soon be replaced by the M1A2T from the United States. This particular representation of the CM11 is equipped with an experimental French GIAT ERA package, providing enhanced protection against chemical shells.
