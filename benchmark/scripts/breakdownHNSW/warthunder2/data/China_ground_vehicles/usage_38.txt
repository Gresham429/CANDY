Usage of M64: 
Thanks to the fusing of M18's turret onto an M42 Duster's chassis, the M64 retains the same firepower of an M18 while having the mobility of an M41. While it has higher horsepower than an M18 and comes with neutral steering capabilities, it is also 50% heavier than M18 so it might have slightly slower speed, but in most cases this is enough for flanking enemies or rushing for vantage points. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the change of chassis also reduced the wobbling effect on the gun when coming to a full stop, allowing for quicker aim and accurate shooting after stopping from top speed.
