History of T-69_II_G: 
The Type 69 was intended as an improved version of the Type 59. It featured a more powerful engine, two-plane stabilizer, night vision systems, and a 100 mm smoothbore gun, and production vehicles benefited from some technology reverse-engineered from a captured Soviet T-62. However, the Chinese military was not very satisfied with the initial Type 69 variants and only used them in small numbers.
