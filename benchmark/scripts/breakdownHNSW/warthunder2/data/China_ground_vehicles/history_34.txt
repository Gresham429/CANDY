History of M36_GMC_(China): 
According to available documents, neither the People's Liberation Army (PLA) nor the Republic of China Army (ROCA) received the base variant of M36 GMC (although one was captured by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) in 1951 during the Korean War, which is currently displayed in Beijing). However, the ROCA did receive the M36B2 variant from France.
