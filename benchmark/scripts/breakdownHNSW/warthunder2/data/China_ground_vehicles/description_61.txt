Description of AFT09: 
The DaoDan Fan Tanke 09 (AFT09型反坦克导弹武器系统; lit Anti-tank missile weapon system) is one of the dedicated ATGM carrier of PLAGF alongside with platforms with HJ-10 ATGM in PLAGF service. HJ-9 was part of the pre-development efforts by Institute 203 after they foresaw that the combat capabilities of HJ-73 and the earlier variants of HJ-8 would be ineffective against new MBTs; after PLAGF HQ demanded for a new ATGM against possible enemy MBTs by the 2000s, the engineer team based on the previous team that developed HJ-8 started the development of HJ-9 in 1988. The new missile ditched wire-guidance and opted for TV guidance instead, featuring tandem warhead for maximum effectiveness against enemy armored targets and revised solid fuel rocket engines for higher speed. The missile and its weapon system was finalized and delivered to PLAGF in 1999, appeared in both 50th and 60th National Day Parade as the anti-armor spearhead of PLAGF.
