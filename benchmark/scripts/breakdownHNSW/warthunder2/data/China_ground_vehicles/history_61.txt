History of AFT09: 
As the development of the previous generation ATGM has settled (HJ-73) and earlier HJ-8 were proved ineffective against the latest MBTs from both USSR and NATO, PLAGF was in dire for a new heavy ATGM with new guidance system as well as sporting their latest FCS. The new missile started its pre-development theorization in early 1980s by Institute 203 and officially started its development in 1988, with the likelihood of influence from the US BGM-71 TOW captured in Vietnam in terms of caliber and appearance; the engineer team also has to develop TV guidance systems and quad-mount, retractable missile launcher which could be traced back to different ancestors such as the ZDF89 ATGM carrier with quad-mount HJ-8 and WZ504 ATGM carrier using HJ-73 with retractable launcher, the system was later installed on the newly-developed WZ550 4x4 chassis by Factory 256 (NORINCO Chongqing Tiema). Due to the oversized superstructure to fit in the weapon systems, designers simplified the design with superstructures cover only the missiles and new intergraded launcher with enhanced FCS. The result was the HJ-9 that has been finalized in 1995; the new weapon system, delivered in April 1999 for the Project 9910 (50th National Day Parade) as the earliest new equipment for the parade, was first shown in both the 50th and 60th National Day Parade as the vehicles G phalanx and 14th phalanx respectively on a WZ550 chassis with different camouflage designs.[1] In NORINCO catalogues, they also displayed a tripod variant as a standalone weapon system or onboard a open-top Iveco truck as its main weapon; different export customer, such as Rwanda opted to mount HJ-9A launcher on top of their Otokar Cobra APC[2] while Morocco purchased the tripod mount HJ-9A for their Marine Corps[3]
