Description of PT-76_(China): 
The PT-76 (плавающий танк, plavayushchiy tank, or ПТ-76) is a Soviet amphibious light tank that went into service in the early 1950s and quickly became the standard reconnaissance tank of the Soviet Army and other Warsaw Pact armed forces. It was widely exported to other allies all over the world. As China's southeast coastal area was unrestful in late 1957, and the terrain was harsh with massive water networks and rivers, China was committed to developing an indigenous amphibious tank that would be deployed along the southeast coastal area in the event of future conflict. The development code "Project 211 (Object 211)" was assigned in July 1958, and China purchased the Soviet Union's PT-76 amphibious light tank to acquire the technology. The project underwent numerous revisions before entering production as the Type 63 amphibious light tank. Since an early variant of the PT-76 was imported to China, it lacks the two-plane stabilizer that subsequent variants feature.
