Usage of Chi-Ha_Kai_(China): 
The Chi-Ha Kai is best used as a front line support vehicle. Although it has its down sides, a player who knows this tank well can utilise its interesting potentials. Stay close to your teammates, and try to use its manoeuvrability to flank the enemies when possible, while being careful and sneaky as it can be knocked out with a single shot by a lot of tanks.
