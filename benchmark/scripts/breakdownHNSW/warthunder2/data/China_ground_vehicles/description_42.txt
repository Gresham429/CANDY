Description of ZBD86: 
The ZhuangJia BuBing LÜDai 86 (ZBD86式步兵战车; industry code: WZ501) is the Chinese reverse-engineered version of the Soviet BMP-1 which was acquired from military equipment exchanges with Egypt in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, during military modernization, the PLAGF faced a pressing need for a new IFV for its mechanized troops. As a result, one of the stored BMP-1s from Egypt was transported to Mainland China for evaluation. In order to expedite the development of a new IFV, the Central Military Commission approved plans to reverse-engineer the BMP-1, despite its underperforming gun systems. The WZ501 was subsequently built in December 1980, incorporating some domestic subsystems. However, due to testing and manufacturing flaws, engineers took nearly 8 years to finalize the design, making additional changes that happened to align with the improvements made to the later BMP-1 variants. The ZBD86 successfully passed state certification in 1986 and began production in April 1987, initially with placeholder gun systems. After failed attempts to introduce American and British turrets, the ZBD86 eventually received new 25/30 mm autocannon turrets in the late 1990s, becoming the ZBD86-I and ZBD86A respectively. These versions are still in service and recently competed with their ideological counterpart, the BMP-2, in the Army Games jointly held by Russia and Mainland China, where the ZBD86A demonstrated superior performance.
