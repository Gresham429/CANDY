Description of M8_HMC_(China): 
The 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 (M8 HMC) is a self-propelled howitzer vehicle used by the U.S. Army during World War II. It was built on the chassis of the Light Tank M5 and was armed with an M116 howitzer (later changed to M2 howitzer; also known as the M101 howitzer) mounted on an M7 mount. During World War II, the M8 HMC was transported to China as part of the lend-lease program, where it functioned as a fire support vehicle for the Chinese Nationalist Army. However, since the Japanese conquered most of the coastal areas and ports later in World War II, the M8 HMC were transported to China in relatively small numbers as the allies had difficulty finding an appropriate landing spot for bringing in equipment while avoiding Japanese capture at the same time. The only occasion the M8 HMC may have seen limited combat was during the Huai Hai campaign of the Chinese Civil War, when both sides deployed tanks.
