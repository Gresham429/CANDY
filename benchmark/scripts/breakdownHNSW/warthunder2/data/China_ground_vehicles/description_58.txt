Description of CM25: 
The CM25, officially known as CM25拖式飛彈車 (lit. TOW Missile Vehicle) in ROCMC's description plate during open day, is the missile carrier of ROCMC. The CM25 has to trace back to its hull - CM21; after the Nationalist Government signed contracts to repair US Army's M113 APC in Taiwan Island due to the heavy loss during the Vietnam War, the experiences gained during rebuilding these hulls and previous attempts to built the Project Wancheng (萬乘; lit. 10 thousand vehicles/chariots) prototype vehicles were then used to reverse-engineer a domestic APC using parts from M113. There are variants such as its base model APC, mortar carrier, commander vehicle and the TOW launcher vehicle; although there were plans to built an IFV with GIAT's autocannon, the project was ditched.
