Usage of Type_63: 
The Type 63 is best used in a way that avoids direct exposure to enemy fire and gives you time to set up shots and ambushes. Running straight into battle or rushing cap points may not end well. Flanking is a recommended method as this gives you the time you desperately need due to slow turret rotation and reloading. It also gives you chances to shoot at enemy side armour, which is the only way to penetrate heavier enemies if you use conventional shells. When flanking, avoid driving in the open if possible and keep an eye out for other light vehicles. Some of them, like armoured cars and Hellcats, can be overpressured by the HEAT-FS round on occasion, while others like the M41 Walker Bulldog used by several nations cannot and are best dispatched with the APHE rounds. Once a good position is reached, stay close to cover and be sure to hide when reloading.
