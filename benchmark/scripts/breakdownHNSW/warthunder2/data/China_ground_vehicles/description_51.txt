Description of M60A3_TTS_(China): 
The ␗105 mm Gun Tank M60A3 TTS, officially M60A3戰車 as listed on ROCA open day's description, is currently the only two MBTs in ROCA active service alongside with CM11 since 1990s. Due to the aging of their already obsolete M48A1 fleet and intensify of possible cross-strait conflict, ROCA ordered 460 M60A3 TTS from US stocks (160 in 1994 and 300 in 1996 respectively, delivered from 1995 to 2002) to upgrade their tank fleet with more advanced FCS than PLAGF tanks. Although the outbreak of war was adverted, these tanks would mostly be used by ROCA armored corps on the main island; after the plans to upgrade all these tanks domestically with 120 mm gun and new FCS were cancelled in favor for retrofitted M1A2T, the remaining operable tanks will serve ROCA for the time being until the new tanks deliver from 2024. With only 108 M1A2T deliver in future, some of these M60A3 TTS will receive FCS upgrades while some will upgrade their now-discontinued engines to higher output Renk America AVDS-1790-2 CAU (1050 hp).
