Description of CCKW_353_(M45): 
The CCKW 353 (M45), where the truck platform was known as the 季姆西十輪大卡車 (GMC 10-wheeled truck) by the NRA during 2nd Sino-Japanese War, was the attempt by the ROCA to built domestic SPAA. The CCKW-353 2 1/2 ton truck manufactured by GMC has been a staple of ROCA during both the Civil War and the Taiwan Strait Crisis as ROCA's utility trucks; due to the spares information on the modification, it was very likely that ROCA assembled CCKW-353 truck with a M45 quad-mount turret as placeholders or mock-ups for the ROC Year 50 (1961) parade in Taipei to show the strength of the armed forces. After M35 trucks and new SAM systems were introduced, these trucks were likely been abandoned and were lost in history, with only very sparse images during the parade that shown their existence.
