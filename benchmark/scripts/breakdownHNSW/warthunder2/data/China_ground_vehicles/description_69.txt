Description of ZTZ99-III: 
The ZhuangJia Tanke ZhuZhan 99 Stage III (ZTZ99式主战坦克 III类定型状态; lit. Third Type Certified Design; industrial code WZ123B) is the finalized 2004 design of the WZ123 project, with slight alterations to both the turret and hull (extended rear turret basket and ERA coverage, and revised welded turret and ERA block placements). This design soon became the standardized revision of ZTZ99 and was first shown in military training images by 2006. First officially publicized during an exhibition at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution (中国人民革命军事博物馆) and being the leading vehicle phalanx of the 60th National Day Parade in 2009, the ZTZ99 is still in service with its LRIP version (ZTZ99-II) and its successor (ZTZ99A), mostly in northern China and Tibetan Plateau where there are extensive plains for tank assaults and defense.
