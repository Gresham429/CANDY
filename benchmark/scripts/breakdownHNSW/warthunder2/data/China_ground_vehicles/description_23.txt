Description of M42_(China): 
The ␗M42 Duster(known as the M42防空砲車 in ROCA service) is the SPAA of ROCA and ROCMC since 1958 as the replacement of M19 GMC. Due to its inferior performance by the 1960s where supersonic jet were commonplace, these vehicles were usually used as a fire-support vehicle instead thanks to its devastating dual 40 mm autocannon; although domestic 20 mm autocannon and imported SAMs have replace them by 1980s, they are still sometimes used during exercises as fire-support vehicle by ROCMC in recent years.
