Description of Marcolin%27s_C.R.42_CN: 
The CR.42 was an attempt by FIAT to modernize the CR.32 that saw great success in the Spanish Civil War. The CR.42 would also be an excellent biplane and was considered the best biplane of World War II by many experts and analists. Even though it was outdated, in early World War II it saw some success as an escort fighter, night fighter and even interceptor, it was even capable of dogfighting with some of the early variants of the Hurricane and Spitfire. When the war progressed the CR.42 was relegated to night bombing, light ground attacker or patrol. One of the most influential pilots of the night fighter variant of the CR.42  (The CR.42 CN) was the Italian pilot Luciano Marcolin, the commanding officer of the 377a Squadriglia Autonoma.
