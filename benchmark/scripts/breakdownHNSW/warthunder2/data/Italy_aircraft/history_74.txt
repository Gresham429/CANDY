History of G.91_YS: 
During the 1960s, Fiat began developing a successor to their previous G.91 fighter, which had thus far managed to obtain a favourable reputation with its operators. Fiat based their new aircraft heavily on the two-seat trainer version of the G.91 and decided outfit the aircraft with two General Electric J85 afterburning engines contrary to the preceding single-engine G.91.
