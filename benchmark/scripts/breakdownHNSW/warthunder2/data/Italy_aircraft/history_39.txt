History of C._202D: 
The story of the C. 202D began in 1941 when the newer and deadlier Macchi M.C.202 Folgore ("Lightning") began to equip units of 7Â° Gruppo. It was developed and manufactured by Macchi Aeronautica for the Italian air force. The C. 202 was designed by a team headed by the company's chief of design, Italian aeronautics engineer Mario Castoldi. As per company tradition, Macchi aircraft designed by Mario Castoldi received the "C" letter in their model designation. It was derived from the C. 200 Saetta by using the airframe of the plane as a foundation for a new fighter. However with various different modifications, for example the cockpit became enclosed. It also would be modified to accommodate a more powerful licensed-built Daimler-Benz 601Aa engine. Swapping the old, radial engine for the German-designed, inline Daimler-Benz produced tremendous performance gains. for the aircraft. The C.202's fuselage would also streamlined to eliminate unnecessary drag as well as to better house the new engine. Where the Saetta"s top speed was only 504 km/h, the Macchi C 202 Folgore enjoyed a top speed of about 600 km/h. Eventually after a few prototypes and refinement of the design, the aircraft would receive its baptism by fire in 1941, around the same time it would first enter service inside of the Royal Italian Airforce. Many pilots had loved the design and the allies would begin to realise its presence and the threat it posed due to the great characteristics it sported. It was one of the many great Italian aircraft which would usually win dogfights it took part in. It was serve on the African front and more famously in the countless sorties around Malta. The Folgore would grow into the backbone of the Italian air force. In fact, it would soon be  regarded as one of the best Italian fighter aircraft of the second world war. It also did receive several upgrades during its left. In terms of this specific variant of the plane known as the C. 202D, in late 1941 the Italian Air Force would conduct an experiment. This experiment included changing the position of the coolant radiator, and installing it directly under the engine. This idea was not the first time it was attempted, as it was already attempted with the prototype of the Caproni Vizzola F6M, which made its first flight in September 1941 with a radiator directly under the engine. This variant of the C. 202 was specifically tested on the serial variant known as MM.7768. The aircraft would then be re-classified as the C.202D. The new installation was designed in such a way to allow in theory, to simplify maintenance and improve the cooling system itself by eliminating the long and vulnerable pipes. Moving the radiator under the engine also created an opportunity to consider the possibility to carry external payloads in central position. However, during the experimental phase, it became evident that doing this came with some setbacks. The testing revealed that it would cause unacceptable drag penalties which would hinder it during dogfights, so the idea was dropped. Moreover, changing the design would have caused delays in the production line and cost way too much money for Italy.
