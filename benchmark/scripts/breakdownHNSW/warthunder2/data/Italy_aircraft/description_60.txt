Description of G.55S: 
During the end of World War II, in order not to consume too many resources to produce a new airplane some engineers began to try to make small modifications to specialize such an airplane, there were several new variants, in particular we saw the development of the G.55 which was modified to create the G.56 variant and also the G.55S variant, the G.55S is a variant specifically for attack against enemy ships, in fact the S stands for Silurante, it could mount a torpedo in comparison to the standard G.55, only a few examples were built then used in battle but without having any success against ships but more used as an air superiority plane.
