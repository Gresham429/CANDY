Description of CR.32_quater: 
The CR.32 quater was the next development of the CR.32 family, in particular compared to the CR.32 ter, this variant was lightened to increase manoeuvrability at low altitudes. It was the last variant of the CR.32 to be built when production of them ended in 1939, and they began to be replaced by the more powerful CR.42 from 1940 onwards. When World War II broke out, the CR.32 quater were mostly in the hands of the 1st, 2nd and 6th Stormo, Caccia Terrestre, and a small part of the Gruppi Autonomi, and eventually the 410th and 411th Squadriglia Autonoma Caccia located in East Africa.
