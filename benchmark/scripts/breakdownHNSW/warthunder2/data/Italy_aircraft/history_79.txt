History of F-104S.ASA: 
An upgrade program was carried out in the 1980s while the Italian military was working on the Eurofighter Typhoon, resulting in the F-104S-ASA (Amodernamento Sistema Arma; "Weapon Systems Upgrade"). The ASA is differentiated by the additions of the AIM-9L Sidewinder missile and the Italian Selenia Aspide semi-active radar homing missile. The avionics, countermeasure systems, and weapons were improved, however the cannon could not be carried along with the missile guidance equipment due to improvements in avionics. The ASA was also tested with Flare and Chaff pods, which was also one of the notable improvements over the S variant. The ASA would be updated once more beginning in 1995-1997 to the ASA/M standard. The changes were relatively minor and limited to the addition of modern AIM-9Ls, overhauling the electrical system, and adding new navigation features. These changes also resulted in a pure interceptor and therefore could not carry rockets or bombs.
