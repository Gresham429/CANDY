Usage of G.55S: 
Arcade Battles: Once in the game, climb to a suitable altitude. The G.55S's high climb rate ensures that the plane can quickly gain an altitude advantage over its adversaries. Once altitude superiority has been achieved, practice Boom & Zoom tactics against enemy planes and take them out in high-speed fly-bys. Due to the low armour on the G.55S, it is not recommended to loiter about. Rather, minimize the time being targeted by enemy vehicles.
