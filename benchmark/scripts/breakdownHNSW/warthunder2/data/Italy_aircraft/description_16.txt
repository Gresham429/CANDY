Description of B.R.20M_M1: 
The B.R.20M M1 was an important upgrade over the original BR.20 Cicogna, in fact it was the most widely produced variant of this bomber. The upgrades consisted of a redesigned nose with a smaller glass area for the gunner and more glass at the lower section of the nose. It also had a redesigned deffensive armament, now introducing access to 12.7mm HMGs, far more superior than prior 7.7mm LMGs. The BR.20 was Italy's most predominant bomber during World War II, however it was considered outdated by the time the war started, but even with that in mind, it served with Italy between 1936 and 1945. It also served with Japan, although it was not very well regarded and was retired to training duties in 1941.
