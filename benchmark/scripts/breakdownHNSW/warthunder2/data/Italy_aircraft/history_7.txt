History of G.50_serie_2: 
The G.50 was the first all-metal Italian monoplane fighter, and the first with retractable landing gear. A contemporary of the CR.42 biplane, it was a transitional plane that was not well-liked by pilots used to more manoeuvrable biplanes. Sturdy and easy to handle, it was slow and poorly armed even by early war standards. Designed by Fiat's Giuseppi Gabrielli, it lost the 1936 competition for a new interceptor to the Macchi M.C. 200, but was chosen anyway. Combat flight tests in Spain in 1939 followed, and the first planes entered combat service in late 1939. Finland bought 35 G.50s, using them in their air force until 1944.
