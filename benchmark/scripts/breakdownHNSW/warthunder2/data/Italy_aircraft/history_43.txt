History of C._205N2: 
The C.205N2 was a further development of the C.205V Veltro, Macchi engineers tried to perfect the C.205V design and they developed the "Orione" variant with 2 different prototypes: the new variants got increased firepower and high-altitude performance. To achieve this, the engineers made the fuselage longer and increased the wingspan of the aircraft and in the second prototype they have adapted the fuselage for a 20 mm cannon within the engine shaft.
