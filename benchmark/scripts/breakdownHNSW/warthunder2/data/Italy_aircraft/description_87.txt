Description of Tornado_ADV: 
The Italian Panavia Tornado ADV was born out of a joint effort by Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom during the late Cold War in the 1970s. The Tornado would be designed as a twin-engined, variable-swept wing aircraft with a two-person crew, an internal gun, and provisions for a wide array of ordnance which included guided/unguided bombs, mine launchers, rockets, air to air missiles, and air to ground missiles. The ADV variant was made to be better suited for air-to-air engagements, it had access to better avionics and better anti-air missiles. Italy would gain access to this aircraft due to the need to replace the F-104S as their frontline air-defence fighter jet.
