Usage of Bf_110_G-4_(Italy): 
The Bf 110 G-4 is an excellent aircraft to perform almost any task. It can be used to defend allied bombers, or it can simply act as a support aircraft thanks to its two rear machine guns. It is an excellent aircraft to destroy ground targets and provide cover for allied tanks, but it can also be used as a heavy fighter and thus provide air superiority in a very effective way, if accompanied by some fighters. It is recommended to use it according to the needs of the team. If the squadron needs more of a CAS aircraft, the various payload options allow it to perform the task as a CAS aircraft, if bombers need cover then do not equip external payload and gain the necessary altitude to fight. It is a very versatile aircraft to play.
