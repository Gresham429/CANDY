History of Vampire_FB_52A: 
The de Havilland Vampire was an early British jet fighter. Its development began in 1941 and the design boasted several novel features. It was powered by a single turbojet engine in contrast to the twin engined Gloster Meteor due to the availability of more powerful engines; most production Vampires were powered by the Goblin engine, also manufactured by the de Havilland company. The twin-boom tail design allowed the fuselage to be kept short, reducing the length of the jet pipe and maximizing the amount of effective thrust by minimizing energy losses from friction. The air intakes were also located in the wing roots as opposed to directly in front of the engine. The fuselage was largely constructed of balsa wood as on the de Havilland Mosquito. While the Vampire first flew only months after the Meteor in 1943, it arrived too late to see combat in World War II. In Royal Air Force service, the initial Vampire F.1 variant replaced propeller fighters. Later fighter-bomber versions under the "FB" designation were capable of serving ground attack roles, leaving air defence to the better suited Meteor. While the Vampire was not an impressive jet aircraft in terms of speed, climb rate, or range, it was agile and easy to handle. It would ultimately equip 33 air forces over more than 30 years of service. The RAF retired the Vampire from combat roles in 1954 but retained the trainer variants until 1971. The design was developed further into the de Havilland Venom, which had a new engine and wing.
