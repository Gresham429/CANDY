History of Tornado_IDS_(1995)_(Italy): 
The Panavia Tornado was born out of a joint effort by Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom during the late cold war in the 1970's. The Tornado would be designed as a twin-engined, variable-swept wing aircraft with a two-person crew an internal gun and provisions for a wide array of armament which included guided/unguided bombs, mine launchers, rockets, air to air missiles and air to ground missiles. The aircraft was also armed with 2 German made 27mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon which was able to make short work of pretty much any aircraft it had in its sights, with the right munition it was also capable of taking out lightly armoured vehicles such as the BMP-1. The Panavia Tornado was primarily made to undertake missions which included tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence and maritime patrol. What they aimed when making the design was an aircraft which could be very multi-role, ot would allow the Panavia Tornado to replace several different types of aircraft which were at the time in service with the respected countries. The main variants which were designed included the IDS which was mainly a strike-fighter, the ADV which was the Air Defence Variant and lastly the ECR, which was mainly created to carry out recon and SEAD missions. In terms speed the Tornado could go up to 2,400 km per hour, its engine being known as the Turbo-Union RB199-34R Mk.103. After several proposals and design changes, the first prototype of the Panavia Tornado would fly on the 14th of August, 1974. The prototype would further solidify the partnership as when it was being demonstrated, a lot of positive comments would be made. Thus development would continue smoothly with the first aircraft being officially delivered to the RAF (Royal Air Force) and the German Air Force on 5 and 6 June 1979 respectively.
