Usage of Breda_88_(P.XI): 
The Breda Ba.88 (P.XI) should be used to attack ground targets, for aerial manoeuvres it simply lacks the grace or flying ability necessary. Yet even ground strafing can be difficult due to sluggishness and even deadly as the pilot is extremely vulnerable. Try to avoid enemy planes if possible, as any enemy that engages on its own accords may prove to be fatal. Also note the Ba.88 can carry bombs but does not have air brakes or bombsights, so one must manually slow down and estimate the payload release on target.
