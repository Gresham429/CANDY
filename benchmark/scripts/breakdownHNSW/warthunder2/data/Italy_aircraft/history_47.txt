History of P.108B_serie_2: 
Building large aircraft is difficult even for large companies, and it was no different when the famed Piaggio S.p.A. endeavoured to build a large bomber in the mid 1930s. Giovanni Casiraghi had recently returned after 9 years in America and was put in charge of building the original P.50-I mid wing design being made of wood and used the common-for-the-era tandem engine layout (e.g. Farman 222). This design was disappointing so Casiraghi reworked it into a more familiar 4 puller engine layout, but still made of wood. The P.50-II flew even worse, but the experiment was not a wasted exercise.
