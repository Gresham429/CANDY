Description of Breda_88_(P.XI): 
The Breda 88 (P.XI) was developed in the mid-'30s as a heavy fighter with a range of 2000km, capable of fast interception against enemy bombers and fighters at high altitude. For the time it was seen as revolutionary, it set up multiple records with the prototype Ba.88, thus it was a very promising design. It was amazingly fast for its time, and was used as an air racer, too. However after being deployed the aircraft performed much more poorly, due to the added weight of navigation equipment, weapons and other systems, so it never saw use as a heavy fighter/interceptor.
