Description of Re.2005_serie_0: 
The Reggiane Re.2005 "Sagittario" (Archer in English) was the result of many years of developing and refining the Re.2000 series of fighters. It was much faster than previous models thanks to its DB 605A engine and was more aerodynamically sleek. These changes helped propel the Re.2005 to speeds well over 640 km/h (397 mph). The elliptical wing, also seen in early Spitfires, gave the Re.2005 an incredible turn rate that could keep up with Spitfires. German pilots would also state that the Sagittario had similar flight characteristics to the Bf 109 G-14. The Re.2005 was a relatively good aircraft, but it would never be built in massive numbers. Only a handful were produced, and the armistice forced the destruction of some Re.2005s.
