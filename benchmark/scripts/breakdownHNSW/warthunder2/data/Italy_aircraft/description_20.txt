Description of CR.32_bis: 
After the development of the CR.32, an improvement of the aircraft was requested. In particular, two 7.7 mm machine guns were added, which increased the weight, though it was accepted by the pilots despite the loss of manoeuvrability and speed. 328 examples were produced from April 1936 until July 1937, and 45 of these were sold to Austria. These CR.32 were used in the Spanish Civil War with the Aviazione Legionaria with great success, proving to be deadlier than other biplanes also in service like the I-15, and even the I-16. They also served during World War II where they were later replaced with the more powerful CR.42 and relegated to training or used for civilian purposes.
