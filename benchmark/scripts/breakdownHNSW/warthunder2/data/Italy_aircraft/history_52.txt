History of G.55_serie_1: 
The Fiat G.55 serie 1 (G.55/1) was the first production aircraft series of the Fiat G.55 family. The aircraft's origins can be traced to a variant of the Fiat G.50, to be powered by a new Fiat RA.1050 inline engine (a license-built variant of the DB-605). The first G.55 prototype flew on 30 April 1942, immediately exhibiting its great flight performance and handling characteristics. Though initially equipped with a 20 mm MG151/20 cannon and four Breda SAFAT machine guns, the design was revised to include two additional cannons replacing two of the wing-mounted machine guns. This armament scheme became the standard for G.55/1 aircraft, though some had field-modified wing machine guns instead of the cannons.
