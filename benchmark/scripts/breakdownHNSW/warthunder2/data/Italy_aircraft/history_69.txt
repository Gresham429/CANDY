History of G.91_R/4: 
The story of the Fiat G.91 R/4 began during the late stages of the Cold War, with the first pre-serie G.91s being tested in Italy. NATO had set up a competition between nations, in the hopes that all NATO members would share the same aircraft to facilitate the overall structure of NATO member air forces. Having access to the same aircraft en mass would have benefited the alliance in many ways, such as the availability of spare parts, NATO pilots being able to operate the same aircraft (meaning that in the event of war there would always be trained pilots available to operate the aircraft), and overall saving a lot of time and money. The original competition specifications which NATO outlined called for a jet able to carry up to 450 kg of ordnance, an operational radius of 180 km, with a maximum speed of at least Mach 0.95 and a takeoff distance of no more than 1,100 m, on unprepared or grass runways. For this, a lot of nations had decided to take part, mainly because it would result in an influx of financial support. Overall from all the nations that had decided to participate, 8 aircraft competed. This would include aircraft such as the French Dassault Etendard (then called the Mystere XXVI), the British Folland Gnat and the Italian Aerfer Sagittario 2 which would ultimately lose to the G.91. During the competition, a lot of aircraft would not pass to the next stages of the competition. The G.91 among some other aircraft were selected for the second round beginning in late 1957. The Italian Air Force was already showing interest despite the NATO competition still ongoing, eventually Fiat went ahead with a small batch of 27 pre-production ("pre-serie" in Italian) aircraft, with the first flight of the G.91 being completed in August 1956, seven months ahead of its competitors. Sadly, during testing the first prototype of the G.91 would crash due to aeroelastic vibrations in February 1957. Although this proved to be a setback, it did not stop the interest from the Italian Air Force, and the G.91 would still enter the second round of the NATO competition as scheduled, shortly thereafter announced as the winner in January 1958. After extensive testing of the Fiat G.91, and some refinement to the design, the first official major order from the Italian government would arrive, which initially ordered 23 examples of the production version of the G.91.
