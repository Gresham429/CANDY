History of G.55S: 
Early Italian fighter planes were mainly built over the Italian copy of the DB 601 engine, such as the C.202 Folgore. However, with the appearance of the DB 605 engine and the acquirement by Italy on its licensed production as the Fiat RA. 1050, the Italian aircraft manufacturers moved on to produce a more capable aircraft that could exploit this engine's power.
