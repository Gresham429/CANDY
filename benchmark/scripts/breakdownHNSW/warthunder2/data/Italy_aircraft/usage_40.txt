Usage of Re.2001_CN: 
The Re.2001 is a very manoeuvrable plane with decent performance at all altitudes. The great MG 151s (with access to devastating Minengescho√ü rounds through the Air Targets belt), respectable climb rate, and good high altitude performance allow it to be an effective interceptor. With its ability to mount a single 250 kg bomb, it can also be a fighter bomber that can drop its payload and then join the furball as a regular fighter.
