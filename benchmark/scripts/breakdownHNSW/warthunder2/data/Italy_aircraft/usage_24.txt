Usage of C._200_serie_3: 
The C. 200 serie 3 is a fighter aircraft exclusively made for the energy fighting style. With its excellent acceleration and climb rate, it will not be a problem to take off and gain altitude faster than your opponents. It is recommended to play it at medium-high altitude because without combat energy, this aircraft looks like a brick. Once you've gained enough altitude, jump on top of your enemies without fear of ripping a wing because this plane is capable of reaching 750 km/h before breaking up. When you have accumulated enough combat energy, you can challenge even the most manoeuvrable planes, but be careful not to run out before the end of the fight otherwise it will be very difficult to win.
