History of P-47D-30_(Italy): 
The Italian Air Force operated some 100 P-47s between December 1950 and March 1954. After the Second World War, the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties placed severe restrictions on all of the Italian armed forces, but due to their actions towards the end of the war and Italy becoming one of the founding members of NATO in 1949, there was an immediate need for the modernization of all sections of the Italian armed forces, which included the Italian Air Force. As such, the West would begin to send additional aid, mostly surplus equipment that no longer had a use to Italy. Italy already had experience in using American aircraft as the Italian Co-Belligerent Airforce during the end stages of the Second World War, equipped with aircraft such as the P-39 aircobra. Thus American military aid sent by the Mutual Defense Assistance Program brought about the introduction of America's premiere piston-powered fighters, being the P-47D-30 Thunderbolt, P-38 Lightning, and P-51 Mustang, into Italian service. The 5th Stormo would primarily use the P-47's, they aren't known to have taken part in any conflict but were likely part of several NATO exercises during the era they were in service.
