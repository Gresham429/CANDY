History of G.91_R/1: 
The first production version of the G.91 was the G.91 R, which was intended for both close support and photo-reconnaissance. The first production aircraft was finished in 1959, and the R/1 entered Italian Air Force service with 14th Gruppe in March 1961. In total 48 of this model would be built, all serving with Italy, while the West Germans used the more powerfully armed R/3 and R/4 variants. These would be followed by another 50 R/1B combat aircraft.
