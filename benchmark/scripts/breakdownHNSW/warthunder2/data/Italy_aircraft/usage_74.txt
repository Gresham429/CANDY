Usage of G.91_YS: 
The G.91 YS has a lot of power and energy potential, keep that in mind before going into battle. To add to this fighters punch, it also utilises AIM 9B missiles and in capable hands, this fighter can be a monster on the battlefield. The YS also has the capability of mounting 76 x FFAR Mighty Mouse rockets which provide the potential of low-altitude Boom & Zooming on trucks, anti-aircraft artillery, light tanks and even enemy fighters attempting an airfield capture, though this does not come without a cost. When dropping in low on ground targets, the fighter sacrifices its speed and manoeuvrability for that ordnance. The YS also can outfit a few bombs so the YS can then be used as a base bomber following up by attacking enemy fighters, but even still it isn't always reliable and can be easily intercepted from any other supersonic fighter jets patrolling the area.
