Usage of CR.32_quater: 
The CR.32 Quater does not have a real playstyle that differs much from other biplanes. Compared to the Soviet and German biplanes, it is slightly less manoeuvrable because it has a little more structural resistance, this also means that it is able to absorb many more shots during fights. Its increased resistance allows it to absorb many hits from 12.7 mm MGs without causing too much damage to the aircraft. In these cases, each player is free to use the aircraft as he likes, being a biplane it is difficult to differentiate it from the others, but use it in pairs or in groups when possible because its slowness is a disadvantage in solo fights.
