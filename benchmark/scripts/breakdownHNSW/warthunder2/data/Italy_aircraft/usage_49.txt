Usage of Hs_129_B-2_(Romania)_(Italy): 
The plane is very heavy, which makes it nearly impossible to take out fighters (unless the fighters come to the Hs 129 B-2, see below), even most medium bombers are more manoeuvrable, however the plane is heavily armoured. Even so, don't expect to hold up well against cannon fire and any machine gun fire targeted towards you will be a death of a thousand cuts. The armour around the cockpit makes getting pilot sniped uncommon but not rare. Don't expect this plane to fly you back home on one engine. If the engine is shot out, it usually means that your wings are also damaged which means a loss of lift, which on a one-ton brick means a death sentence. The planes incredibly stable flight behaviour makes aiming even for joystick pilots very easy and accurate thus not wasting too much ammunition.
