Usage of CR.32_bis: 
The CR.32 bis is virtually similar to its reserve counterpart, the CR.32 with the exception of 2 additional 7.7 mm machine guns.Equipped with air targets belt, it can easily set other planes on fire. The only downsides of the plane are the lack of protection and speed. While these machine guns provided extra kick to the opponents, the CR.32 bis will have to face much faster and stronger opponents: monoplane fighers and bombers. The best way to use the CR.32 BIS is by playing as a support. As a biplane, you can easily outturn most opponents. The recommended tactic is to always have an altitude advantage over your enemies. Do not turn too much and fire your machine gun in bursts as you have limited ammo, this means you have to be more careful when engaging targets. With a top level speed of only 380 km/h, the CR.32 will be usually outrun by most opponents it faces. Instead, climb to much higher altitude, then use its surprisingly fast dive speed to execute boom-and-zoom attack to kill an unsuspecting opponents. While it can dogfight against monoplanes to some extent, the CR.32 bis' poor energy retention will eventually catch up and slow down the plane significantly, be decisive and strike at enemy weak points (engines, pilot, etc.) to finish them off as fast as possible.
