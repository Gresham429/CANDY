Description of AV-8B_Plus_(Italy): 
In 1989, Italy's ban on using fixed wing aircraft in naval aviation was finally lifted, and without missing a beat, Italy signed a contract the following year for the purchase of 14 AV-8B+ VTOL fighters and 2 TAV-8B trainers for usage aboard their Giuseppe Garibaldi-class aircraft carrier. The Harrier IIs would form the backbone of Italian naval aviation in the modern era, being modernized for operations aboard the new Cavour-class carrier and soon the upcoming Trieste carrier, where they will be supplemented in the VTOL strike role by F-35B Lightning II fighters.
