Usage of Ba.65_(K.14)_L: 
Although the Ba.65 is an attacker, it can be used in an anti-fighter role with much success. The plane receives an air-spawn which invariably allows it a significant altitude advantage over enemy fighters. Boom & Zoom tactics, therefore, become very effective against slow, climbing, enemies. The Ba.65 has very good armament for its battle rating, and they will be enough to destroy any enemy fighter with one precise diving attack.
