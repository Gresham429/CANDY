Description of SM.91: 
During 1942, the Regia Aeronautica required a defence fighter to provide a defence against bombers accelerating the advance of Allied troops into Italy. The SM.91 was created, a twin-engine fighter with DB 601 engines, armed with six 20 mm MG 151s up front and a turret equipped with a 20 mm MG 151 controlled by the gunner. 2 were created, taking flight for the first time on 11 May 1943, and achieved 27 hours of flight time but never entered official evaluations. One was captured by the Germans, while the other was destroyed by Allied bombing raids.
