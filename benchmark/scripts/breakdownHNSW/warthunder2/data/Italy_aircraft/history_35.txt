History of He_112_B-1/U2: 
In 1933, the German air ministry (RLM) issued a requirement for a new fighter aircraft to replace their ageing biplanes. The aircraft was to have a Junkers Jumo 210 engine and an armament of two 7.92 mm machine guns. It was also required to be of all-metal construction, monoplane design and have retractable landing gear. Arado, BFW and Heinkel were all awarded contracts to design and build prototypes; the final ones submitted were the Ar 80, Bf 109 and He 112.
