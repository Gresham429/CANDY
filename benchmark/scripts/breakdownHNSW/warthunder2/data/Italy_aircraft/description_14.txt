Description of S.81: 
The S.81 was introduced in a time when Italy needed an aircraft capable of covering the large distances of the African Campaign, providing reconnaissance and the ability to carry bombs. Chief designer of the new project, Alessandro Marchetti developed the aircraft based on the Savoia's SM.73 airliner and militarized the vehicle for its intended use. The first prototype flew in 1935 and the aircraft was designated SM.81 Pipistrello ("Bat"). The aircraft served until 1944 with a total of 534 units built. For its time, the aircraft was considered one of the best medium bombers, but when World War II broke out it was already an outdated design. It served with Italian forces in Spain and Africa, and three were also sent to the Chinese Nationalist Forces but they were lost in training exercises in early 1938.
