Usage of Re.2000_G.A.: 
The Re.2000 G.A. can be used in the same way as the Re.2000 serie 1 in the air superiority role. The bomb load is not large enough to be worthwhile against ground targets or base bombing, especially since the Re.2000 G.A. does not have an airspawn, so using it as an attacker or bomber is not recommended.
