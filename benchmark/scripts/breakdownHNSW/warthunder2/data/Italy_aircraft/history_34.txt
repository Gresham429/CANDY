History of Z.1007_bis_serie_5: 
One of the three standard Italian wartime bombers, alongside the S.M. 79 and the B.R. 20, the Z.1007 had speed, armament, good range, and an acceptable bombload. It was used on all Italian fronts despite being of all-wood construction. Also known as the Alcione, it was designed by Filippo Zappata and built by Cantieri Aeronautici e Navali Triestini (Trieste Shipbuilding and Naval Aeronautics), with the prototype debuting in spring, 1937. After 34 original models, production shifted to the bis model, with a more powerful radial engine; over 400 of this model would ultimately be built. They conducted combat tests with Italian forces in Belgium during the Battle of Britain in September, 1940, used for diversionary actions only. Their real combat debut was a month later, during the Greek campaign. They also flew in Africa and the Mediterranean. They were not used much in Russia. A total of 560 were built, with about 60 still in service when Italy surrendered. About 30 continued on after, now in Allied service, in the Balkans.
