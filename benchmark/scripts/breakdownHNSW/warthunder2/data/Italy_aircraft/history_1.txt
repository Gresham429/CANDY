History of Ro.44: 
The IMAM Ro.44 was a single seat fighter seaplane derivative of the Ro.43 and first flew in October 1936. By taking out the rear gunners positions and all the extra equipment and radios, the much lighter aircraft gained in manoeuvrability but barely any speed increase. At a distance, both the Ro.44 and Ro.43 are practically indistinguishable due to the copied design. It also did not improve on its predecessor for seaworthiness, being too difficult to land in open ocean. In the end it was a disappointment, with its order reduced from 50 to 35 and being soon used as trainer for advanced pilots.
