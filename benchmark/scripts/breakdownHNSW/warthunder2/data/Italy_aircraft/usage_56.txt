Usage of Bf_109_G-14/AS_(Italy): 
Just like its predecessors, the G-14 should generally be utilised as an energy fighter/Boom and Zoomer. While it's fairly more manoeuvrable than other Bf 109s, its increased agility should be used for maintaining high speed and energy rather than dogfighting, since even the G-14 is only passable at best. Due to its excellent energy retention and climb rate, it is exceptionally good at stall fighting, since many fighters will not be able to keep up with its climb rate, giving it the opportunity to put overconfident pilots in vulnerable situations.
