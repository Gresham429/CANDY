Description of Re.2000_serie_1: 
The Re.2000 was a monoplane fighter developed in Italy during the mid-1930s. It was one of the first modern fighters used in the Regia Aeronautica. It also served in the Swedish Air Force as the J20, and in the Hungarian Air Force as the MÁVAG Héja I, a modified version of the original model. The design team took inspiration from the American Seversky P-35. The aircraft was considered an outstanding dogfighter, proving superior to the more modern Macchi C.200s and Messerschmitt Bf 109 Es in flight trials. However, the aircraft was not deemed satisfactory by the Italian military, and its manufacturer exported most of the produced units to Hungary and Sweden. The aircraft served as a basis for future models like the 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 fighters.
