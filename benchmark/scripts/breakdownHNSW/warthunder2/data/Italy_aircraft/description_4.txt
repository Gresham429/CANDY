Description of CR.32: 
The CR.32 is a biplane fighter designed by the aeronautical engineer Celestino Rosatelli, as a modification of the CR.30: the structure around the engine was modified, and the armament was improved with two Breda-SAFAT 12.7 mm. It was given the serial number MM 201, tested at Montecelio and consequently renamed to CR.32. The biplane was appreciated by the Regia Aeronautica for its balanced manoeuvrability and armament and was used in several units and various campaigns.
