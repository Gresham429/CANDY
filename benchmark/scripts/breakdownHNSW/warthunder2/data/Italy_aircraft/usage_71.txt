Usage of F-104G_(Italy): 
F-104G is a hit-and-run type of airplane, for the simple fact that the wings of this airplane are very small, and this means the aircraft has little manoeuvrability. Its strong point is its engine that makes it very fast and gives it a thrust of 4,530 kgf while with afterburner 6,360 kgf, this makes it capable of regaining speed very quickly after a manoeuvre.
