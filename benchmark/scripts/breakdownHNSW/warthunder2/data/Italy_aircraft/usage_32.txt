Usage of S.M.79_B: 
It is a bomber with a decent climb rate for the BR, allowing you to easily get above fighters. In most scenarios, you will eventually be intercepted at the end of the battle. Try outrunning climbing enemy fighters at high altitude, since most fighters at the BR will see their performance drastically reduced at high altitude. If you face a interceptor like the MiG-3 or the P-38, it is better to turn back to base or seek allied cover.
