History of F-16A_ADF_(Italy): 
The history of the F-16 ADF began during the mid 1980s, America had phased out their USAF Air Defense Command which meant the duty to protect the American skies would completely fall to the Air National Guard. Their main task was to intercept bombers from the Soviet Union during a theoretical invasion. This meant that they would need an agile aircraft which would not only be fast enough to intercept the high altitude bombers, but also be properly equipped to shoot enemy aircraft down. General Dynamics initially would convert up to 270 F-16A/F-16B airframes into ADF standard. The modification would retain the ability to mount air-to-ground missiles, rockets and bombs however it introduced the AN/APG-66 radar which greatly improved target acquisition of small targets, IFF for distinguishing friendlies and foes (AN/APX-109), and a 150,000-candlepower night spotlight for identification. The ADF would be in service for many years, but ultimately due to the Cold War dying down after the dissolution of the USSR, the need for all the surplus F-16s would dwindle down. Some of the ADFs would be converted back into regular F-16As or Bs, whilst others were either put in storage or exported to other nations.
