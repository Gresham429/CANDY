Description of G.91_YS: 
The G.91 YS was based in the earlier G.91 Y, which was a complete redesign of the G.91 series of aircraft, going from a small and light airframe to a heavier and more capable one, with two afterburning engines, a longer range, and a bigger payload for ground attack missions. The G.91 YS was a version of this fighter developed for Switzerland, the main difference was slightly modified avionics and the addition of more modern loadouts, such as AIM-9 Sidewinders. Though the country was interested in acquiring the G.91, the purchase was never completed.
