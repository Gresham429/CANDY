History of G.91_Y: 
The story of the Fiat G.91Y began during the late stages of the cold war. During the mid 1960s, Fiat decided to develop a new lightweight fighter-bomber, destined to replace the G.91R aircraft which at the time, would be in service inside of the Italian Air Force. They were also looking and studying the possibly to raise the interest in a possible purchase of this new aircraft by other air forces who were looking to replace their G.91s. In addition, some requirements from the AM (Aeronautica Militare) needed the new aircraft to be capable of medium-range interdiction missions as a successor to the Italian F-84Fs which had been taken out of service. During the design stages Fiat decided to start and base the new aircraft from the previously made G.91T air frame. During development however the airframe underwent several different changes that in effect made the aircraft basically become a completely new machine. One of the main differences between the standard G.91 and the Y variant was the addition of two General Electric J85 afterburning engines, which was contrary to the preceding single-engine G.91. These engines allowed the Fiat G.91Y to nearly reach speeds of mach 1, although ultimately it remained a subsonic aircraft. The aircraft's fuselage and wings were also enlarged to accommodate 3 more fuel tanks (for a total capacity of 3200 liters), it also had bigger powerplant and a vastly improved flight and handling characteristics. The new G.91Y performed its maiden flight in December 1966. Testing revealed minor aerodynamic issues which would be resolved on subsequent production aircraft with only minor redesigns. In terms of armament, another thing the G.91Y improved on from the previous variant was in the form of armament. The G.91Y was equipped with 2 x 30 mm DEFA cannons which were installed unto the aircraft. For suspended armament the following was available for the G.91Y; Mk.82 and Mk.83 free-fall bombs, BL.755 cluster bombs, Orione pod, LAU-3A and LAU-18 rocket pods, Zuni rocket pods, 4 x AS-20s and 2 x air-to-ground AS-30L (LÃ©ger) Nords. Fiat had named the aircraft to G.91Y, probably to exploit the overwhelming positive image it had gained through previous G.91 users. After a few modifications and refinement of the design, the first 55 aircraft orders for the Italian Air Force would be completed by march of 1971 (out of a grand total of 67 aircraft eventually being delivered). The G.91Y served exclusively with Italian squadrons up until the early 1990s, before being replaced by the AMX International.
