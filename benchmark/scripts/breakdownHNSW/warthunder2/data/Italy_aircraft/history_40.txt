History of Re.2001_CN: 
The Reggiane Re.2001 was designed to be a replacement for the failed Re.2000, and did away with the weak Piaggio P.IX radial, in favour of a new, more powerful R.A.1000RC.41-1a Inline (which was a fiat built, more powerful and reliable DB 601A, the same engine used in the early BF 109s). Other than the engine and shape of the nose, there were no real notable changes between the Falco I and Falco II. The Falco II retained a fairly similar fuselage and even kept the entire tail unit. While considered to be equal to the Macchi MC.202, the MC.202 had the first call on the R.A.1000, and the Re.2001 was delayed by several design changes the Italian army insisted on, giving the MC.202 almost a full year head-start on its rival, leading to more Macchi fighters being produced than Reggiane fighters.
