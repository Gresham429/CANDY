Usage of G.91_pre-serie: 
Air superiority is the combat objective for the G.91 Gina, anything else is secondary. In team games lure enemy fighters into extensive and excessive dogfights to allow your heavier and less nimble allies to "Boom-and-Zoom" or "Boom-and-Run" them. With their great thrust to weight ratio the G.91 can maintain their energy superiority and in emergencies (such as non-existant teamplay) to disengage. Alternatively standard BnZ is considerable choice. Again the great acceleration allows for more energy expensive manoeuvres and still disengage without much worry from the target. Such follies would be deadly in many other fighters, but the Gina is hence quite forgiving. In fact too forgiving, new pilots to the jet age need to lose old habits and the G.91 does not force one's hand.
