Usage of G.50_serie_2: 
The Fiat G.50 Freccia is a typical Italian pre-war design, it's fairly sturdy, has modest speed and armament for the BR consisting of 2 Breda-SAFAT 12.7 mm guns mounted in the upper cowling, which means it has the distinctive low rate of fire (roughly 400 rounds per minute). However it does have its merits as well, it's fairly agile, it has no trouble dog fighting Hurricanes it will commonly face, and if things become too hectic, the G.50 can quickly escape by going into a dive, and exploiting its surprisingly good dive acceleration to gain separation. Furthermore it pays to be aware of its modest acceleration and overheating, as such, it's generally advised to keep an eye on your speed and use WEP sparingly.
