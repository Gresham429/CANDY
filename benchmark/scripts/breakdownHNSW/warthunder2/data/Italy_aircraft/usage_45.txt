Usage of P-47D-30_(Italy): 
Always maintain speed. The P-47 handles like a dream at about 550-650 km/h (350-400 mph), but once it gets below 350 km/h (220 mph) it handles sluggishly, like a pig dipped in mud. One great thing about the handling at high speed though, is that the P-47 responds quickly at high speeds, and this allows some impressive defensive scissoring without losing wings at terminal velocity. The high-wing loading is an issue though, as the Jug will lose most of its energy in a blackout turn. This does endow the Jug with one key feature. it is a rock-solid gun platform.
