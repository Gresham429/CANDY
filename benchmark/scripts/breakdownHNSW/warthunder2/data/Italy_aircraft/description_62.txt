Description of Vampire_FB_52A: 
In 1946, the Kingdom of Italy became a democracy (the Italian Republic); meanwhile, between the 1950s and 1960s, a big step in aviation took place due to the simple fact that jet aircraft began to enter service in several nations, replacing some propeller-driven aircraft. In Italy, the first aircraft to be acquired was the Vampire F.3, and then later the Vampire FB.5. and eventually 51 Vampire FB.52As were purchased from Great Britain. The FB.52A variants in particular had a new Goblin 3 engine that offered more thrust than the FB.5's Goblin 2. After the delivery of the 51 Vampire FB.52As, Italy began to produce them locally by FIAT and Macchi building 195 units. In 1960, they were decommissioned and replaced by the F-84G Thunderjet.
