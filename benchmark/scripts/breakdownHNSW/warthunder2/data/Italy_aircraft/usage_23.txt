Usage of Re.2001_CB: 
The Re.2001 CB can be used in air battles as a fighter since it does not differ greatly from the original Re.2001. In this role, it should be primarily used against other fighters as opposed to hunting bombers or heavy twin-engined fighters because of its lacklustre guns. It is best to drag opponents into extended engagements since it is unlikely that the Re.2001 will be able to destroy a target in one pass.
