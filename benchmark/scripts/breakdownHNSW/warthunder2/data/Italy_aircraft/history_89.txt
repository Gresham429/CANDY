History of AV-8B_Plus_(Italy): 
The Italian's Harrier story begins on 1st February 1989. Due to post-war laws, Italy had a very strict guidelines to follow when it came down to its own military forces, these laws would however change shortly after Italy would join NATO. Of these many laws, one would prohibit the Italian Navy from possessing heavily armed aircraft. As such, a new law would be passed known as the "La Legge N.36 del 1 febbraio del 1989 " or "Ali alla Marina" (wings to the Navy) which allowed the Italian Navy to equip itself with armed jets to not only bolster its forces, but mainly to guarantee the security of the Italian Navy and one of its flagships known as the Garibaldi. The Italian Navy was only looking for VTOL/STOL aircraft, so in turn it went for the Harrier, as it fit the role perfectly. Italy was always interested in the Harrier and had even designed a few VTOL/STOL designs of its own, one of the Harrier prototypes was also tested in Italy which likely further pushed the Italian Navy's interest in the platform. This aircraft has been seen being used in multiple countries. Users of the Harrier II include Spain, America and the UK under several different variants. BAE systems had acquired the right to further develop and build the AV-8A that the Americans were already using, so in turn BAE systems had improved it so much such as giving it a better engine. Along other upgrades and changes BAE systems had practically made a new machine which now went under the name of the AV-8B, and also went by the name of "Harrier II". It had access to the latest logistical equipment, and was able to partake in day/night operations.
