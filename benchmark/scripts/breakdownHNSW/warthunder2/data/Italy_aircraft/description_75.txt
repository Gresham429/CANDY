Description of F-84F_(Italy): 
The F-84F was exported to several countries, one of which was Italy. The 102nd Group was the first Italian air group to equip the F-84F and replaced the F-84G in 1956, then later the 101st Group, and finally the 103rd Group. The F-84F was not much liked by the pilots at the time because it had poor flying qualities, however between 1958 and 1959, the F-84F was used by the Diavoli Rossi aerobatic patrol. In addition to the F-84F, Italy also used the reconnaissance variant the RF-84F. Eventually, the F-84F would be replaced by the G.91 and in other groups by the F-104G, and their last use would be by the 5th Air Brigade to escort Pope Paolo VI who went to Israel for the first time in January 1964.
