Usage of G.50_AS_serie_7: 
The Fiat G.50 Freccia is a typical Italian pre-war design, its fairly sturdy, has modest speed and poor armament consisting of 2 Breda SAFAT 12.7 mm guns mounted in the upper cowling, which means it has the distinctive low rate of fire (roughly 400 rounds per minutes). However it does have its merits as well, its fairly agile, it has no trouble dogfighting Hurricanes it will commonly face, and if things become too hectic, the G.50 can quickly escape by going into a dive, and exploit its surprisingly good dive acceleration to gain separation. Furthermore it pays to be aware of its modest acceleration and overheating, as such, its generally advised to maintain an eye on your speed and use WEP sparingly.
