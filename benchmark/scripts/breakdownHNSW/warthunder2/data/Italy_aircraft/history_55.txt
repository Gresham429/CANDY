History of C._205_serie_3: 
The Macchi C. 205 was a development of the famous C. 202 "Folgore". The Folgore was the most modern and effective domestic fighter available to the Regia Aeronautica when it was introduced in 1941, proving itself well against Allied Spitfires, Hurricanes, and P-40s. It did still have a number of flaws, including the weak armament of only two heavy machine guns and two rifle-calibre machine guns. This was insufficient for attacking heavily protected American bombers. The design still had further developmental potential and the improved C. 205, initially designated the C. 202bis, mainly differed by the installation of a German DB605 engine (used by the German Bf 109G series) instead of the license produced DB601 used by the C. 202.  The DB605 was heavier and more powerful but had very similar dimensions, easing the transition. The resulting aircraft had much improved performance over the C. 202, comparable to the other Italian "Serie 5" aircraft powered by the DB605: the Fiat G.55 and the Reggiane Re.2005. The C. 205 had the worst handling at high altitudes due to its relatively small wings and high wing loading. Its strengths were in speed and diving abilities at low and medium altitudes. Its similarity to the existing C. 202 was a significant advantage, especially compared to the high performing but very complex Re.2005, and it was chosen for mass production along with the G.55.
