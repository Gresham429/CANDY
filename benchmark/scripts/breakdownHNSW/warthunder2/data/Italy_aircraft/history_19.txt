History of Marcolin%27s_C.R.42_CN: 
The C.R.42 was Fiat's attempt at modernizing their C.R.32 design, which was deployed during the Spanish Civil War with great success. The new fighter would be of all metal construction, with Fiat's new, home-grown A.74 supercharged radial engine. The result, was a fast, accurate, and manoeuvrable platform, that, while outdated at the onset of World War Two, would be almost the pinnacle of biplane design.
