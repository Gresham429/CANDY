History of Re.2005_serie_0: 
It has been called "the most beautiful fighter aircraft of the war" and "aerodynamically perfect". The Re. 2005 was the final version of the basic Reggiane fighter design that began with the Re. 2000 in 1939. The third of the Serie 5 third-generation Italian fighters designed to take the DB 605 engine, it had numerous improvements over the company's previous models. Test flights on the prototype began in April 1942, three weeks behind the third-generation M.C. 205 and nine days behind Fiat's G.55. But only 29 of the planned 750 were ever built. Operational service began in May 1943 with the 362nd Squadron in Sicily, and then Capua, until the armistice. A few are known to have flown in battle for the German Luftwaffe over Berlin in the final days of the War in Europe.
