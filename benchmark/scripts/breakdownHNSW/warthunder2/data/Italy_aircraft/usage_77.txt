Usage of Ariete_(Fighter): 
Using the Aerfer Ariete is quite straightforward, it's an aircraft that nearly anyone can pick up and do fairly well in. It plays basically like a better Sagittario 2 so a lot of how to use this vehicle remains the same. The Aerfer Ariete will be one of the top dogs when it comes to dogfighting, this is mainly due to its amazing flight performance, which when compared with the majority of aircraft it'll face in a downtier, make this vehicle quite fun to use. The best way to play the Aerfer Ariete is to climb to an average altitude of around 3,500-4,000 metres at a 10Â° angle to make sure that you have some spare speed, and engage with any somewhat isolated enemy you can encounter. This is highly effective mainly due to the powerful 30 mm HS 825 cannons that the Ariete has access to. This plane is really good dogfighter so you are able to perform quite a lot of manoeuvres that many aircraft are not able to pull off. Make sure you consider that during engagements, especially because the aircraft can easily pull G's without too much punishment towards the player controlling it. However, you should be careful to not get caught in a furball or doing sustained turns as your plane bleeds a higher amount of speed during turns than your enemies, However if you have a pack of enemies behind you, and you're flying at a good speed (650 km/h or more), you can pull hard to evade all of them and try to fight back. Keep in mind, if you want to take advantage of its speed and manoeuvrability, you will have to keep the aircraft as light as possible, meaning bringing the minimal amount of fuel. This may seem like a disadvantage to some, but it's likely the most effective way to get eliminations with the vehicle as it allows the aircraft to remain fast and nimble. Do keep in mind that if you decide not to bring a lot of fuel, you won't be in the battle as long, so make sure to make every second count.
