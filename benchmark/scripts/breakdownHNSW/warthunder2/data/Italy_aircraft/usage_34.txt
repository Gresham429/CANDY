Usage of Z.1007_bis_serie_5: 
Lacking in both defensive armament and protection, not to mention blessed with early control lock-up speeds the Z.1007 is pushed into the role of a hit-and-run bomber. Either against ground bases with mediocre success or as ground support against stationary ground units and armoured columns. The latter option is quite viable with multiple drops available per run depending on the load-out, learning the drop order of the payload allows to maximize the effect of each bomb by selecting the appropriate target in ground strike missions.
