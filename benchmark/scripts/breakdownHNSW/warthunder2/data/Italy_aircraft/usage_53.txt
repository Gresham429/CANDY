Usage of Re.2005_serie_0: 
The Re.2005 is a classic dogfighter, with surprisingly amazing manoeuvrability that can catch most enemies off guard and shred them with its excellent armament setup. While the aircraft can tailor to most forms of air combat, it should ideally be used as a mid-to-high altitude energy fighter or turn fighter where it can use its amicable energy retention and spectacular manoeuvrability to its advantage.
