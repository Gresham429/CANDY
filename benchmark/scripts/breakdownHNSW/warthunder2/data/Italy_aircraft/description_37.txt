Description of IAR-81C: 
The IAR-81C was a Romanian fighter that was developed before but served in World War II. Developed from the IAR-80, the vehicle went through several modifications until reaching the IAR-81C standard, which was the latest wartime variant of the IAR-81. The C variant was requested by the Romanian Air Force in 1942, with a couple of improvements, mostly, improved offensive armament. The first order for 100 airframes was delivered, like all of the prior updates to the 81 series, with the centreline bomb rack removed to be used as fighters. An additional order for 35 was placed in February 1943, and then another 15 in January 1944. These aircraft were primarily to replace losses in earlier models while production of the Bf 109 G ramped up.
