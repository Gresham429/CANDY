Description of CL-13_Mk.4: 
In 1949, Canada wanted a new fighter to supplement its growing air force. The F-86 Sabre was a good option, but the Canadian government didn't want to have another American aircraft in service. As a compromise, Canada received a license to build their own Sabres and thus birthed the Canadair Sabre. The Mk.4 was originally intended to have Canada's own engine in place of the J47-GE-13; the Avro Canada Orenda 10. It would've been a substantial improvement over the J47 but it wasn't ready by the time the Mk.4 was introduced and as such, the J47 was kept in. Other than minor changes like the compass, it was largely the same as the Canadair Sabre Mk.2. Italy would end up receiving over 170 Mk.4 Sabres from the Royal Air Force and continued to use them until the F-104 Starfighter began service with the Italian Air force.
