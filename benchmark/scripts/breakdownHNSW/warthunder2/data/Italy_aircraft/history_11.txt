History of Breda_88_(P.XI): 
The Breda Ba.88 was an Italian heavy fighter bomber that was made for the Regia Aeronautica's 1936 requirement for a twin-engine heavy fighter capable of 329 mph, 2,000 km range, and capable of carrying 20 mm cannons. It made its debut around late 1936 to 1937 and during its evaluation, it was a promising design. Standard firepower of the plane was three 12.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine guns in the nose and a gunner in the dorsal turret with a 7.7 mm Breda SAFAT machine gun. The prototype aircraft flew with two Isotta-Fraschini K14 series while production models of the plane had two Piaggio P.XI RC.40 "Stella" 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engines capable of 1,000 hp each, setting several new world speed records in 1937, with speeds in the 550 km/h range. By 1938-39 the Breda Ba.88 came into production but it would be retired in 1941 with only 149 made, after only brief service in Libya in the summer of 1940. The plane was found to perform much more poorly with an operational bombload and unsuitable for the designated role of heavy fighter/assault.
