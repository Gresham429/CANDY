History of SM.92: 
The Savoia-Marchetti SM.92 was an Italian prototype heavy fighter/bomber aircraft developed during the Second World War. Based on the previous SM.88 prototype heavy fighter, the aircraft featured a dual-boom design with two engines and two crew members both in a single cockpit. Like its predecessor, only a single prototype was built; this aircraft was tested but later damaged when an Axis fighter pilot mistook it for the similarly-shaped American P-38 Lightning. After being grounded for repairs, the single aircraft was destroyed by Allied bombing, thus ending the life of this unique Italian heavy fighter.
