History of F-86K_(Italy): 
The F-86K is the NATO variant of the F-86D with the exception it did not sport the internal FFAR Mighty Mouse rocket launcher, but 20 mm cannons and Sidewinder missiles instead. Many foreign countries wanted a high altitude interceptor. This need was created by the Soviet bomber threat many Western countries feared of. The U.S. felt the F-86D would be the perfect candidate for NATO countries, however, they didn't give the F-86D away. This was due to sensitive material the F-86D possessed, especially the state-of-the-art fire control system. Not only was the fire control system sensitive info, but it was also unreliable and the U.S. did not want to give unreliable equipment to other NATO countries. So the U.S. came up with the F-86K, an almost exact copy of the F-86D other than an improvised fire control and a slightly longer nose. After the F-86K was designed, production started with NAA (North American Arms) making around a hundred F-86Ks. These were shipped to NATO countries and Italy, but the U.S. also sent sets of parts to Italy around 1956. Fiat took these sets and assembled their own F-86Ks. Some of the Fiat assembled F-86Ks were shipped to France or other NATO countries. Italy continued to use F-86Ks up until they started to slowly get rid of them starting 1964 to make space for the F-104 Starfighter. The last Italian F-86K was decommissioned in 1973.
