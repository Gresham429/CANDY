Usage of SM.91: 
When flying it as an interceptor, it can shred bombers apart with its powerful armament and can ward off escorts who try to tail it with its single 20 mm cannon. However, it is paramount that you come in from oblique angles when attacking bombers, as their gunners can easily take out your pilot due to your lack of armour and bulletproof glass.
