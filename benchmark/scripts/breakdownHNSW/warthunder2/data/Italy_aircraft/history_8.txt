History of G.50_AS_serie_7: 
The Fiat G.50 "Freccia" ("Arrow") was the first monoplane fighter to be adopted by the Regia Aeronautica. Designed for a 1936 fighter tender, the G.50 competed with a number of contemporary Italian designs like the Macchi C.200 "Saetta". It was a clear step above the CR.42 "Falco" biplane fighters that had equipped the Italian military at the time: the all-metal monoplane construction with retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit gave it superior speed to the outdated Falco. The development process was complicated, however, and the G.50 underwent many revisions in response to changing specifications and design flaws uncovered by testing. For example, the enclosed cockpit was abandoned after the first production series. Though it arrived and began production earlier than the C.200, the overall performance of the Freccia was somewhat inferior, especially in terms of speed. It was retained since retooling the Fiat factories to produce Saettas would take too much time, effort, and resources. The basic G.50 was produced from 1937 to 1940. It saw considerable service during World War II, but due to the rapid pace of aircraft technological development, it was outdated even at the start of the war. Slow speed, poor armament, limited range, and a complete lack of armour protection did it no favors. The Hawker Hurricane, itself not a cutting-edge fighter, easily outclassed the Freccias during their deployment in the Battle of Britain. The G.50 had somewhat more success in North Africa against British aircraft. They were eventually relegated to fighter-bomber roles, which they fulfilled well. Other users of the Freccia included the Independent State of Croatia and Finland. The latter used their G.50s to surprisingly good effect against the Soviet Union, but they were ill suited for the freezing northern climate and were held in lower regard than other foreign aircraft obtained by the Finnish Air Force.
