Usage of G.56: 
Thanks to the powerful DB 603 and general aerodynamic improvements from the previous G.55, the G.56 will be a competitive aircraft in almost any role you put it in. Low-altitude, medium-altitude, high-altitude, energy fighting, Boom-&-Zoom, or (in some cases) turn-fighting, the Super Centauro can do it all! However, your ideal flying style should be as a more reserved medium to high altitude energy fighter, as this is the area the aircraft excels. One should always keep their speed up, a minimum of 370 km/h (230 mph), as this allows you to whip your nose around with alarming speed and bug out of unfavorable scenarios. The G.56 can very quickly bleed velocity in high-speed horizontal turns, and you may find yourself struggling to regain it.
