History of F-104G_(Italy): 
The story of the Italian F-104G originally began in America. In February of 1954 at the Lockheed facilities in America, the first 2 prototypes of the F-104 would take flight for the first time. America was looking to develop a new aircraft to combat the Soviet's new age of supersonic jet fighters. The aircraft would incorporate the smallest possible airframe with the most technologically advanced turbojet at the time, to create the base of what would become the F-104. Although the program would have some minor setbacks, such as the intended engine not being available during the beginning, development would continue and would lead to the first variant of the F-104, the F-104A. From the base variant of the F-104 many variants would begin to be developed, such as the F-104C, the F-104S and in this case, the F-104G.
