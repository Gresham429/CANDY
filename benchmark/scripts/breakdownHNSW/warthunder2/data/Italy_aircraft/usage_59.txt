Usage of Yak-9P_(Italy): 
Though the Yak-9P is similar to the Yak-9U in terms of design, handling, and performance, its places more emphasis on armament than performance. The Yak-9U could match or exceed most of its opponents in climb and speed and easily engage in energy fights. The Yak-9P faces tougher opposition and it is difficult to argue that the performance has improved, so it is important to pick your battles carefully and make good use of the powerful guns to destroy opponents quickly.
