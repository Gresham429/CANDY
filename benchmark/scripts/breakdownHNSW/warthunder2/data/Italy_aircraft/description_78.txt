Description of F-104S: 
The F-104S would be one of the most capable Starfighter variants ever built. The F-104S would receive Sparrow missiles, the NASARR R-21G/H radar, more hardpoints, and other airframe improvements. It was essentially an evolution in the F-104G. Fiat would take charge of producing the new Starfighter variant with the help of Alfa Romeo and Selenia. The first F-104S would take flight in late 1968, and Fiat would build over 200 F-104S Starfighters by 1979. Around 40 F-104S aircraft were exported to Turkey which continued using them until the mid-1990s. This would also mark the end of the Starfighter's production run as more advanced planes replaced it.
