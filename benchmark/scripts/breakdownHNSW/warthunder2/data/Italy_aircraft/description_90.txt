Description of MiG-29_(Italy): 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian air force was in a very weak state, with their best fighters at the time being a selection of poorly maintained MiG-23MFs. However, in 1993, a welcomed surprise upgrade happened, as the Russian Federation's debt compensation package to Hungary included twenty-eight MiG-29 aircraft, of the 9.12 chassis standard. Hungary would operate these aircraft extensively and begin the most in-depth pilot training program for its air force since the 50s as a result. The Hungarian MiG-29s would begin the end of their service in 1999 when Hungary joined NATO and was essentially forced to upgrade to a NATO fighter aircraft for compatibility and interchangeability purposes. As the JAS-39C Gripen was chosen and purchased, the MiG-29 fleet was slowly retired as deliveries of the Gripen took place over the next decade. The last Hungarian MiG-29 was retired in December 2010, when the decision was made to sell all former Hungarian MiG-29s to the highest bidder.
