History of Re.2001_CB: 
The Re.2000 "Falco I" was the Reggiane company's first successful fighter design. Taking some design notes from the Seversky P-35, the Re.2000 was a very capable design compared to other early Italian fighters like the Macchi C. 200. It did have several issues: the wing mounted fuel tanks were not self sealing and the engine was unreliable. In light of this, the Regia Aeronautica declined to order the Re.2000 for mass production and it was largely produced for export.
