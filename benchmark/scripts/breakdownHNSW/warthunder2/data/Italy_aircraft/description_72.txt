Description of Sagittario_2: 
The Sagittario 2 is a rank VI Italian jet fighter 
with a battle rating of 8.7 (AB), 9.3 (RB), and 8.0 (SB). It was introduced in Update "Red Skies". The Aerfer Sagittario 2 is one of the more nimble and dog-fight friendly jets that Italy has access to inside its tech tree. It has great handling and 2 fast firing cannons which destroy pretty much any aircraft that is unlucky enough to get hit by it. Sadly it does not have a lot of fuel for it to be able to stay in the air for too long, so players may not want to over extend when playing the aircraft. Aerfer Sagittario 2 is a prototype aircraft which was competing with other NATO designed aircraft during the cold war, with its aim to become the next standard NATO jet. Although the Fiat G.91 was the winner, Aerfer would go unto develop the Aerfer Ariete, which was based on the Sagittario but with an extra engine.
