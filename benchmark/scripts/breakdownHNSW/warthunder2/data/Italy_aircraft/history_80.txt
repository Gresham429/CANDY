History of AMX: 
The story of AMX International began with a joint cooperation between Alenia-Aermacchi of Italy and EMBRAER of Brazil. The project emerged from the need to find a suitable replacement for the G.91 Y and to assume its role as a ground attacker. The G.91 Y was becoming outdated and unreliable, prompting the search for a more modern aircraft. Italy also sought an advanced multi-role platform with reconnaissance capabilities. Brazil joined the collaboration to replace the outdated Aermacchi MB-326, which was not adapted for modern warfare.
