Description of P-47D-30_(Italy): 
In 1949, five years after the Second World War, Italy became one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In an attempt to modernize the aging Italian Air Force, Aeronautica Militare, the United States sent outdated or surplus equipment to countries like Italy under the MDA (Mutual Defense Act). As a result, Italy received around 100 P-47s. The P-47D-30 was essentially a P-47D-28 with minor improvements and dive brakes.
