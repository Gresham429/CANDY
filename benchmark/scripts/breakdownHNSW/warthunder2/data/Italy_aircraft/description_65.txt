Description of G.91_R/1: 
The G.91 was a light subsonic fighter developed by Fiat in the late 1950s, it was a great success being introduced in the Italian, German, and Portuguese air force. The objective of said fighter was to create a cheap, light fighter-bomber capable of becoming the standard between all NATO nations, this was due to the experience of the US and UN forces in the Korean War, and the introduction of more capable jet engines, that pushed the NATO Command to set a competition for this role. A total of 756 aircraft were built in a span of 19 years. The G.91 R/1 was the first light attack/reconnaissance version of the G.91; compared to previous versions, it featured the same armament and powerplant, but added the capability to launch MACLOS guided AA-20 and AS-20 Nord missiles, as well as three cameras mounted on the nose.
