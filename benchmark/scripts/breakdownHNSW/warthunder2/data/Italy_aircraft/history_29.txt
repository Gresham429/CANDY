History of SM.91: 
In 1942, the Regia Aeronautica requested a new, long range aircraft that was to be powered by the German DB 601 Inline Inverted V12, carry an 800 kg bomb load, have 6 x 20 mm main armament and a single 20 mm rear cannon. Savoia-Marchetti had previously worked on the SM.88 heavy fighter and the request for a long range fighter disqualified the 88, as it only had a 1,250 L fuel capacity. SM started to work on a new fighter named the SM.91 that was made entirely out of metal, had 6 x 20 mm MG 151 cannons (7 if you count the rear gunner) provided by Germany, was powered by two DB 605 engines and had a range of 1,600 km with a 1,600 L fuel capacity that could be enlarged to 1,800 L with auxiliary tanks.
