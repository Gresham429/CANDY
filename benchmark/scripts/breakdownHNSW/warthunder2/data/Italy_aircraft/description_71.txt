Description of F-104G_(Italy): 
The first F-104G to be delivered to Italy was on March 3, 1961, built by Lockheed and was later disassembled and studied for production in Italy. 105 units were then produced under license in Italy, and they were used as interceptor aircraft, armed with AIM-9B Sidewinder missiles, and in some departments were used as fighter-bombers. After the continued use of the F-104G, an updated version was requested that would become the F-104S produced by Aeritalia. At the end of their service, the various Italian F-104s would become monuments and kept in museums.
