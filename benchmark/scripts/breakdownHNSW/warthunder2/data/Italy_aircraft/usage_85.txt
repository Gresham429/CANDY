Usage of F-104S_TAF_(Italy): 
Being a member of the Starfighter family, the F-104S excels excellently at its main feature - speed and climb rate. As one of the earliest jets to hit Mach 2.0 at high altitude, the design doctrine called for the maximum climb rate and speed possible, resulting in the pencil-like airframe. Players will soon find it very different from other jets of its tier: while those jets would still have the chance to succeed in a dogfight to a certain extent, this is not the case for F-104S. The jet itself does have varieties of air-to-air weaponries, such as later series of rear-aspect Sidewinders and even Sparrows at its disposal, the jet itself does also come with an M61 cannon on the port side of the airframe. At first glance this might sound pleasing as there are 6 missiles in total for the jet, but when players decided to equip AIM-7Es, they will find that the only cannon onboard is removed to fit the Sparrow guidance equipment.
