Usage of Ro.57_Quadriarma: 
At the start of the battle, climb as high as you can. Use the air spawn to your advantage. Intercepting bombers is usually your main job as an interceptor. Head-on engagements are an option as you have good frontal armaments located in the nose. If you are engaged by a fighter, don't hesitate to turn fight. Your turn rate with combat flaps is much better than it may appear and is sometimes on par with even the Spitfire's turn rate under the right conditions. Boom and Zoom can be done but do so with extra caution as you will be chased quite easily by enemy fighters.
