Usage of G.91_R/1: 
Air superiority is the combat objective for the G.91 Gina, anything else is secondary. In team games lure enemy fighters into extensive and excessive dogfights to allow your heavier and less nimble allies to Boom and Zoom or Boom and Run them. With their great thrust to weight ratio, the G.91 can maintain their energy superiority and in emergencies (such as non-existent teamplay) to disengage. Alternatively, standard Boom & Zoom is a considerable choice. Again the great acceleration allows for more energy-expensive manoeuvres and still disengage without much worry from the target. Such follies would be deadly in many other fighters, but the Gina is hence quite forgiving. In fact too forgiving, new pilots to the jet age need to lose old habits and the G.91 does not force one's hand. The G.91 can hold its own against several aircraft at once, but won't be able to win such a battle on its own
