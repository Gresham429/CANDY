Description of C._205N2: 
The C.205N2, also known as the "Orione" ("Orion"), was the next development of the C.205V Veltro. During 1942-1943, the Regia Aeronautica requested an upgrade for the C.205. The C.205N1 prototype was created in 1942 with larger wings and a longer fuselage but only armed with 12.7 mm machine guns, and it was not accepted due to its poor armament. In 1943, the second prototype of the C.205N named C.205N2 was produced with a more powerful engine and the addition of a 20 mm cannon inside the crankshaft. Thanks to its improved armament the C.205N2 was accepted by the Regia Aeronautica but due to lack of resources and the Armistice, it was abandoned and remained at the prototype stage.
