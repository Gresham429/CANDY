History of Re.2000_G.A.: 
The Re.2000 "Falco I" was the Reggiane company's first successful fighter design. Taking some design notes from the Seversky P-35, the Re.2000 was a very capable design compared to other early Italian fighters like the Macchi C. 200. It was an all-metal aircraft like the C. 200 but boasted unique elliptical wings and sleeker aerodynamics. Overall performance was better than the earlier Italian monoplanes and it could even compete with the German Bf 109 E. The Re.2000 did have several issues as a prototype: the wing mounted fuel tanks were not self sealing and the engine was unreliable. It also flew and become operational about two years later than the C. 200 and G.50. In light of this, the Regia Aeronautica declined to order the Re.2000 for mass production and it was largely produced for export to countries like Hungary and Sweden. The Re.2000 did provide a basis for more successful aircraft, its immediate successor being the Re.2001 with an inline engine. A special catapult-launched variant, the "Re.2000 Cat.", holds the distinction of being the perhaps only navalised fighter used in combat by the Italian Navy in World War II.
