Description of AMX: 
The AMX International AMX, known in Italian service as A-11 Ghibli, is a joint venture between Alenia and Aermacchi of Italy, and EMBRAER of Brazil. Italy initiated a requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Fiat G.91 Y's that were in service, while Brazil joined the venture primarily to replace an Italian aircraft in their service, the Aermacchi MB-326. After several prototypes, the AMX was adopted into service by the air forces of both Italy and Brazil. Initially, the primary variant in service was the A-11A, with the AMX-T serving as the dual-seater trainer variant. The AMX served for many decades and demonstrated its worth in multiple deployments. The variant featured in the game is the A-11B / AMX ACOL. The AMX ACOL was a further upgrade which outfitted 55 AMX-11A aircraft with new avionics. These enhancements included the addition of an INS/GPS navigation system, new communication systems, IFF, and new HUD displays. The most significant addition to the upgrade was the capability to deploy smart munitions, such as JDAM bombs, which later played an essential role in its deployment in Afghanistan.
