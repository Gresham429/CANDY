History of B.R.20M_M1: 
Designed by Fiat's Celestino Rosatelli in the mid 1930s and first flying 10 February 1936, the "Bombardiere Rosatelli 20" (B.R.20)  Cicogna (Stork) was an advanced design with a first for Italy all metal structure of duralumin. The fuselage was a space frame structure with the forward half covered in sheets of aluminum and the rear half fabric covering, including all the tail surfaces. The wing was all clad in metal, but the ailerons were also fabric covered. This may seem unusual compared to better known modern semi-monocoque structure, but it was a very common and effective design for the 1930s.
