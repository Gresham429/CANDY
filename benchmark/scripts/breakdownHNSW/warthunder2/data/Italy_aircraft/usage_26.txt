Usage of C._202: 
The most important things the C. 202 needs are speed and altitude. It is generally a good idea to climb to at least 4-5,000 meters before levelling out and gaining speed. From there on, it's Boom & Zoom, working your way from top to bottom. Priority should be given to P-39 Airacobra's, Hellcats and Spitfires, as these are difficult opponents if they are allowed to engage on their terms. The Hellcat is a considerable problem for the C. 202, due to the fact it is considerably faster and climbs fairly well. The best way of dealing with them is to fight them at speeds above 400 km/h, where the Hellcat begins to stiffen up, but you retain your very good roll rate, which you can use to spoil his gun solution by constantly changing direction.
