Usage of Re.2001_serie_1: 
The Re.2001's greatest strength is its turning capability and its greatest weakness is its poor armament. This means that it should be primarily used against other fighters as opposed to hunting bombers or heavy twin-engined fighters. It is best to drag opponents into extended engagements since it is unlikely that the Re.2001 will be able to destroy a target in one pass.
