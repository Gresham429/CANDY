History of Ju_87_D-3_(Italy): 
In early 1939, a commission of the Luftwaffe met the Regia Aeronautica in Italy to share technology and knowledge. The Luftwaffe tested Italian aircraft and the Italian Air Force tested the Junkers 87. The dive bombing technique was not commonly used by Italian bombers as they lacked capable planes like the Stuka. The Italian government ordered 100 Ju 87 B-2 following the visit of the Luftwaffe. Italian fighter pilots were sent in Austria to be trained as Stuka pilots and in the summer of 1940, the Regia Aeronautica had its first dive bombing group followed later by additional squadrons.
