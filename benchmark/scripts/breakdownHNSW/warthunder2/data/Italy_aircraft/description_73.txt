Description of G.91_Y: 
The G.91 Y was a multi-role fighter which first debuted in 1966. Based largely on earlier Fiat G.91 fighters, the G.91 Y was a complete redesign but kept the basic shape of the G.91 series. The biggest difference between the two types was the conversion from a single-engine to two General Electric J85 turbojets outfitted with afterburners. This conversion alone resulted in a 60% increase in the aircraft's thrust, however, it was not enough for this jet to become supersonic even when in a dive. The new design of the aircraft was based on the longer trainer version of the G.91 which allowed the installation of the bigger engines. The armament was also improved with the addition of two DEFA 30mm cannons, and all the G.91 Y aircraft served only with the Italian Air Force.
