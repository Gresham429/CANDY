History of Bf_109_G-14/AS_(Italy): 
In 1943, the Bf 109 G-6 entered service. While its performance was less then stellar, its worth derived from the ability to be easily modified into a dedicated fighter bomber, high altitude interceptor or reconnaissance plane. Likewise, great care was taken to make sure the G-6 could fit heavy armament to attack bombers, which were beginning to appear in force over Germany, and the shortcoming of the Fw 190s at high altitude became increasingly apparent.
