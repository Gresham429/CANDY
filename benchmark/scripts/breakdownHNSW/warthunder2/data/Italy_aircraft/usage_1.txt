Usage of Ro.44: 
The Ro.44 fulfils the role of a dogfighter in battles, boasting fantastic low speed handling (down to as low as 130 km/h) which often gives it the edge in low-rank dogfights. Its powerful armament of twin 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns (a rare armament at such a low BR) usually means it can quickly dispose of enemy aircraft. Against faster monoplane enemies such as the P-36, P-400 or MiG-3, you'll want to enter the fight with an altitude advantage and convert that to speed, giving you enough time to cripple the enemy aircraft even if they choose to use their speed advantage and extend.
