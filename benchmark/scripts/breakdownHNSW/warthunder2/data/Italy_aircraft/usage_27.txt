Usage of C._205_serie_1: 
The C.205 Serie 1 is perhaps the most underrated rank III Italian fighter, most likely due to the underpowered armament which consists of 2 x 12.7 mm and 2 x 7.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns. This can be a serious problem since this fighter is Boom & Zoom fighter, meaning even a successful pass will badly cripple the target instead destroying it. Therefore, stick with teammates in order to support them. The C.205 Serie 1 works well when escorting bombers.
