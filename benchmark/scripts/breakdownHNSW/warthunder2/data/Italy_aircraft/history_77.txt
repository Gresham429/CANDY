History of Ariete_(Fighter): 
The story of the Aerfer Ariete began roughly around the 1950s during the Cold War. The aircraft would be completely designed by Sergio Stefanutti, who was one of the most original and innovative Italian aeronautical designers. In fact, in 1939, he produced the S.S.4 that was the first fighter in the world to fly with canard lifting surfaces and forward landing gear. During the Second World War he was involved in the construction of the "Light fighter", fast and well-armed, which was able to compete with those in its class, equal in weight, dimensions and even greater in power, but which couldn't be mass-produced because of the unfavourable conclusion of the conflict. His work as a designer also continued into the 1940s and 1950s, when, despite the destruction of the war, the Italian aviation industry was still showing its strength, proposing numerous new types of aircraft for both the internal and international market.
