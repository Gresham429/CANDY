History of G.56: 
The concept of the G.56 traces back to 1942, when the Stato Maggiore dell Aeronautica requested Fiat to develop an aircraft based on the G.55 airframe, which would allow it to mount recently available DB 603 engine that produced 1,750 horsepower, 275 more horsepower than the DB 605. Giuseppe Gabrielli designed it in 1944. The design was proven to be an all-around improvement from the already excellent G.55, with Commander Valentino Cus reaching nearly 710 km/h (450 mph) and official records stating a maximum speed of roughly 685 km/h (426 mph). The two Breda-SAFAT Machine guns that were mounted in the nose were removed to make room for the massive engine, reducing the weight slightly and allowing more 20 mm ammunition to be carried.
