Usage of Re.2002_Early: 
Given its low manoeuvrability, bad climb rate and low speed, the Re.2002 should be used as a single-seat attacker. For this purpose, it can carry quite a formidable payload for its size and rank - a single 250 kg bomb and up to 2 x 100 kg bombs, which adds up to 450 kg. In the air RB, this payload will come in handy for destroying a pillbox or two or knocking out some tanks, and you can use your MGs against softer targets.
