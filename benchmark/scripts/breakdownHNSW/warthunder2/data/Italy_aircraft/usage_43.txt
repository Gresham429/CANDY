Usage of C._205N2: 
The C.205N2 belongs to the select few planes who are good for Boom and Zoom as well as turnfighting, it is an extremely balanced multi-role aircraft. It should be played neither at low altitude nor at high altitude, but in-between at medium altitude. It has no problem dealing with all other fighters at its BR, due to its ability to retain energy well. It can hold its own against Bf 109s, Fw 190s and P-51s. It can fight well against Spitfires (with some skill on the pilot's part).
