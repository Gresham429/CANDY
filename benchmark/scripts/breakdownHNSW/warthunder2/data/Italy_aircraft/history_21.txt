History of Re.2002_Early: 
The Re. 2002 was a return to the radial engine, combining the new structural features of the Re. 2001 with an engine comparable to the Re. 2000's. Agile and sturdy, it was the best fighter-bomber/attack plane the Italians had, and was respected by the Luftwaffe, who seized 60 of them when Italy surrendered. In total, 225 were built, the last 40 for the Luftwaffe. Another 40 continued on with Italian forces fighting with the Allies.
