History of Re.2000_serie_1: 
The first project of the Reggiane design office was the Re.2000 which was designed by Italian engineers Alessio and Longhi. The first test flight was flown by Mario de Bernardi in 1939. With a superior engine in comparison to the FIAT-powered M.C.200, it was thought to be at least as manoeuvrable as the Bf 109 E in comparative trials, though the positioning of the fuel tank in an unarmoured wing centre section was found to be a fatal drawback and thus it was not accepted into Italian service, however, the Re.2000 was sold to both Hungary and Sweden to complement their air forces. During 1940, the Italian Navy ordered a modified version for carrier use with a Piaggio P.XI bis engine and structural strengthening for catapult launching and carrier landings.[1]
