Description of C._205_serie_1: 
After the entry of the C.202 into service in 1941, the Regia Aeronautica was already beginning to look for new possibilities for a new generation of fighters requiring better engine power and high performance so that they could change armament. With the Germans' permission to build the DB605A engine in Italy, two development paths were created, one leading to the C.205N 'Orione' programme and the other to the C.202Bis. On 16 December 1941, the first aircraft of the former type, which would later be renamed C.205 V, were built by Macchi with 100 units of the 1st series armed with two 12.7 mm and two 7.7 mm, later by FIAT with 300 units of the 2nd series. The aircraft would fly for the first time on April 19, 1942, then be put into service in February 1943, after which it would participate in several battles, for the most part to defend Italian airspace from enemy aircraft. Even after the armistice, it would still be used by both the Italy Co-belligerent forces and that of the RSI.
