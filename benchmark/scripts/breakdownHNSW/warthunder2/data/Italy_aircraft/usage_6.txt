Usage of CR.42: 
The CR.42 is nothing more than a point-and-shoot arcade-style plane. There is little skill involved at these early rank matches. Therefore, turning is the most appropriate tactic. However, due to the high climb rate, BnZ can be effective strategy in this gamemode. Most monoplanes cannot climb nearly as fast as the CR.42, so you will be able to hold the altitude advantage on them.
