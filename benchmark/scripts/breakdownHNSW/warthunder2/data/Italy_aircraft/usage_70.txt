Usage of F-86K_(Italy): 
The F-86K should be used mainly as a support fighter, due to its sub-par manoeuvrability at low speeds compared to other aircraft at its rank such as the MiG-17. In a 1 vs 1 dogfight, the F-86K is outclassed when pitted against a MiG-17 unless you fight in the vertical. When it comes to bomber hunting, this aircraft has four 20 mm M24A1 cannons which is more than enough, but you will sadly almost never see a bomber. These are also fantastic to use during a head-on attack, but don't commit to head-ons. Instead, fire a burst from maybe .8 km out then pull out. This is to decrease the chances of both of you crashing. Your opponents will mainly be other similarly tiered aircraft, such as the F-86F-2 and J32B.
