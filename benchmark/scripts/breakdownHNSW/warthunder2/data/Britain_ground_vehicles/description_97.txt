Description of Vijayanta: 
The Vijayanta (विजयंता; lit. Victorious) was the first MBT built in India as the licensed variant of the British Vickers Mk.1. As the export tank designed by the Vickers-Armstrong, Vickers Mk.1 were designed to be a lighter yet as powerful medium tank as the Centurion series in British service; the design of this tank was acquired by India in 1961 and development soon started in UK. The development was completed by 1964 with a prototype delivered to India and joined the Indian Army a year later under the name Vijayanta. The tank was saw in action during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 and Indo-Pakistan War of 1999; although planned for decommission by 2008, the introduction of Russian-built/licensed MBTs and complications on the domestic Arjun MBT however didn't fully phrase-out all Vijayanta with were still spotted as late as 2019, serving as batteries for border troops.
