History of Matilda_III: 
With the development of tanks, the British Army doctrine regarding tanks split the classification into two types, the infantry and cruiser tanks. Cruiser tanks were high-speed tanks meant to exploit breakthroughs in enemy lines while infantry tanks were tanks meant to support the infantry advances. Tank developments were based off these classifications. Then in 1934, Major-General Percy Hobart came with a concept for two types of infantry tanks, one machine-gun armed tank with heavy armour and another heavier armoured tank with a cannon and machine gun. The former was developed by Vickers into the A11 Infantry Tank Mark I, or the A11 Matilda. The larger cannon-armed infantry tank was not produced for some time due to finance restrictions. The designing for the latter infantry tank started with the General Staff specification A12 given in 1936. It was considered an improvement over the A11 Matilda and was produced by Woolwich, with Vulcan Foundry as the manufacturer. The A12 took many design implements of an older medium tank known as A7. The increased armour of the developing tank suffered from a lack of engine power, to which it was solved with two AEC diesel engines used in London buses. An order for two wooden mock-ups and two steel prototypes were made to Vulcan in November 1936, to which they presented the wooden ones in 1937 and the steel prototypes in April 1938. The functioning prototype performed well in a 1,000 mile test and only required a few modifications to improve the gearbox, suspension, and the engine cooling. With the approach of World War II, the A12 was adopted and designated the A12 Infantry Tank Mk.II Matilda II, but became more widely known by the name Matilda than its predecessor. The first orders were made after the trials with an order for 140 made in June 1938. Production started from 1937 from its test trials and lasted to 1943 with a total of 2,987 Matilda IIs produced.
