Description of Achilles: 
The Achilles was the name given by the British to the American M10 Tank Destroyers. Britain received about 1,650 M10s from the US. It was so called for both the 3-inch gun variant (Achilles I/II) and the variant mounting the 17-pounder (Achilles Ic / IIc), though in most usage, the vehicle was called the 17pdr M10, or 17pdr SP M10, or even the "Firefly", despite that name being used for a different design. Around 1943, M10s were converted to increase its firepower against the gradually upgraded German tank designs such as the Tiger I and the Panthers. The conversion used one of the best Allied anti-tank guns at the time, the 17-pounder, which could penetrate about 140 mm of armour at 500 m away with APCBC rounds, and 209 mm at the same distance with APDS rounds. In the end, about a total of 1,000 Achilles were converted into 17-pounder variants by the end of World War II, making the M10 Achilles the second-most numerous design to mount the 17-pounder, after the Sherman Firefly.
