Usage of Valentine_XI: 
The Valentine - despite its historical role as an infantry tank - holds a fine balance between offensive firepower and defensive armour, leaving something to be desired for mobility. The Valentine is defended by a reasonably-effective armour setup, with a strong armour setup in the turret. But, the armour around the chassis is lacking. It's reasonably well-sloped, and angling can greatly increase its protective capabilities. The lower glacis is small, but particularly poorly protected. This means that a hull-down playstyle can be very effective in this vehicle, since it hides the tank's weak spots while only exposing the stronger turret armour. This is also more easily accomplished due to the vehicle's small size.
