Usage of Ratel_90: 
The Ratel 90 is a vehicle that should be used primarily in a support or defensive role. In the support role, it is recommended that you stick with your teammates, specifically behind them. Focus on scouting targets for your team. You should stay behind your teammates due to the vehicle's lack of armour, ineffective even against small arms. In the defensive role, you chose a firing spot and cover a certain line of sight with a cover nearby, peaking out only to fire. In both roles, you should make extensive use of your binoculars to scan for and scout targets.
