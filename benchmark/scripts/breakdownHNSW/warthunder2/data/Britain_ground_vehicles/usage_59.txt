Usage of FV4202: 
The FV4202 has sloped frontal armour, a well-rounded and thickly armoured turret and a powerful 84 mm gun with access to APDS ammunition. The first thing that you may notice when you first get the FV4202 is that the stock 20-pdr gun is far more effective than the stock 17-pdr gun, since you start with APCBC ammunition, which is far more effective than the 17-pdr's purely AP stock rounds. This makes it far more forgiving than tanks like the Centurion MK1 or the Challenger. When fighting in a low rank game, it can be a game-changing tank. It can easily take out Tiger I and Panther tanks at long range whilst remaining resistant to enemy fire. Even Tiger II tanks are vulnerable to the 84 mm gun, though their gun poses a big threat to you, especially at long range. When you get up-tiered, you will face far more challenging enemies. At this battle rating, you can face the Jagdtiger, Leopard I, IS-6, IS-3, IS-4M and the T-54 (and even the Maus if you're playing realistic). These are all highly resistant to your APDS (even from the side in the IS-3/IS-4M case), and have extremely potent armament.
