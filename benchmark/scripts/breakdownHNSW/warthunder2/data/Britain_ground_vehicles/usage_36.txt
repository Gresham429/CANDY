Usage of AEC_Mk_II: 
The AEC Mk. II is to play mainly in the role of flanking and reconnaissance. Due to the high speed and thin armour, it is ill-advised to use this vehicle in frontal assaults. Added to the new mechanic of active scouting for light tanks, it is rewarding to be an effective scout by highlighting targets for allies, thus farming SP and experience from their assistance. However, the AEC isn't as small as a scout-like the American M22 Locust, so scouting and flanking can be risky if done incorrectly. The AEC also have the same 6-Pounder cannon found on the Crusader Mk III, Churchill Mk III, Cromwell Mk I and the Valentine Mk IX, so the AEC has a fast rate of fire with an excellent muzzle velocity. Here are some methods for maximizing not only combat effectiveness but also the chances of surviving.
