Usage of Stormer_HVM: 
It is best to hide from sight of others when using this SPAA - move around battlefield and use terrain and caves as a hiding spot for yourself. At the same time, you want to have at least some form of high ground so that when enemy aircraft accidentally exposes itself, you can put an end to it immediately. Exploit mobility upgrades to stand on mountain edges, if necessary.
