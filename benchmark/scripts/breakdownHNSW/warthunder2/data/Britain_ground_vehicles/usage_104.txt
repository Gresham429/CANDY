Usage of Challenger_2_(2F): 
In many ways, the Challenger (2F) plays the same as the precursor Challenger 2. This is because the original armour from the base Challenger 2 chassis remains unchanged, the same occurs with the powerplant. However, it distinguishes with an increase in the ability to brawl, mainly because of the optional Dorchester armour package. The 2F can more confidently find itself brawling alongside its teammates. Though players should be wary of the adversaries they are facing to decide which way of engagement is safer, depending on the map or the circumstances of the battle.
