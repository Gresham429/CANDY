Usage of Black_Night: 
In summary, the Black Night plays in a similar way to the base Challenger 2. This is due to having the same armour configuration, without the option of add-on armour. Where the Black Night differs however is the active protection system. This APS will protect the vehicle well not only from ground launched missiles, but also from air launched missiles provided they are not above the systems maximum elevation.
