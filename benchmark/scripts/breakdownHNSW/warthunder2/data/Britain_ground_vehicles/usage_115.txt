Usage of Challenger_3_TD: 
Use of the Challenger 3 TD is effectively the same as all preceding Challengers with it still lacking in mobility and armour, though finally having access to the DM53 round which will allow it to more effectively pick off targets at range. The addition of a LWR also allows you to more effectively engage in long-distance duels across map. The armour configuration, slow turret traverse and below average reload rate discourages close-range brawls.
