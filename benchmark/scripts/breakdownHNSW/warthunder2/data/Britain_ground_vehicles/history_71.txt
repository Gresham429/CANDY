History of Centurion_Action_X: 
Development of the Centurion Action X began in the early 1950s. The aim of the project was to improve the Centurion's ballistic protection by fitting the vehicle with the recently developed 'mantletless' turret design. The turret was fitted on a Centurion Mk.7 hull and featured thick, heavily sloped surfaces which further increased its effectiveness.
