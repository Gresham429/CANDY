History of ADATS_(M113): 
The ADATS (M113) was a Canadian-operated anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile carrier system, designed to engage both ground and air targets. Developed in the early 1970s by Oerlikon-Buhrle (now part of Rheinmetall), the AA system failed to see service with the countries it was intended for, namely the United States. However, the Canadian Armed Forces procured 36 ADATs vehicles based on the M113 chassis, which served with the Canadian army as anti-aircraft systems until their withdrawal in 2007.
