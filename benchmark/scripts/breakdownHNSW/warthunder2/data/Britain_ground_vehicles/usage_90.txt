Usage of Striker: 
The Striker should be seen as an extremely mobile support platform. It can pose serious intimidation to any enemy thanks to the powerful Swingfire missiles, however, is equally vulnerable against most enemy tanks or planes. It can be very effective when used as a siege tank, up close and personal, rather than a sniper, but not every map allows such a playstyle, especially in RB.
