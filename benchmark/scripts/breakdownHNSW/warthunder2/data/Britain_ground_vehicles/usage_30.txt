Usage of SARC_MkVI_(6pdr): 
In battle, the SARC MkVI (6pdr) should be used similar to the Puma armoured cars, focus on using its speed for quick flanking attacks and scouting targets. Be wary on the terrain the SARC MkVI (6pdr) travels in as the vehicle is quite top heavy. In a scenario where you cannot flank, try to do quick strikes at the enemy. Avoid sniping and frontline combat as, like the Pumas, it has little armour and cannot take cannon fire.
