History of Alecto_I: 
The Alecto I is a British self propelled gun developed from the Tetrach light tank towards the end of the Second World War. Fitted with a newly developed 3.75 inch howitzer in an open top casemate configuration, the Alecto only completed trials after the war had ended, leading to it serving briefly with the British Army in Germany and the Middle East without seeing any combat.
