Usage of Chieftain_Mk_5: 
In long-range fight:
The gun is very precise and the ammunition performs well at longer ranges. Do not forget to keep the hull protected as it is fragile; however, the turret armour protects the tank reasonably well. Invest in camouflage plants, one or two seconds lost by the aiming enemy is time gained to eliminate the threat.
