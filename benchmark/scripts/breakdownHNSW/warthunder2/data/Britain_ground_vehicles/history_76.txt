History of Centurion_Mk_10: 
The tank's concept was made in 1943 when the Directorate of Tank Design, under Sir Claude Gibb, was asked to produce a new heavy cruiser tank for the General Staff under the designation A41, which was to become the standard of a British "Universal Tank" to replace the separated "infantry" and "cruiser" tanks currently used. As World War II progressed and the Germans unveiled their heavier tanks with an 88 mm cannon like the Tiger, War Office made a revision to their design requirements to counter this threat. The requirements now include increased durability and reliability, with the ability to protect itself against the 88 mm gun and mines, agility similar to the Comet tank, and good reverse speed, all while staying under a 40-ton weight.
