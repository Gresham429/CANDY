Description of Challenger: 
By early 1942, the new 17-pounder anti-tank gun had been developed, and was quickly found to be the most powerful armour-piercing gun of the Allied arsenal. A number of projects were initiated looking to fit the new gun into self-propelled mounts, resulting in designs such as the Sherman Firefly and Achilles. One such project was the A30 Challenger, a medium tank-style design utilising the chassis of the Cromwell; however, compromises had to be made, particularly in the design of the turret to fit the larger gun and an additional crewmember, as well as a lengthening of the hull and reduction in armour, leading to both reduced mobility and protection. Production began in March 1944, and the tank participated in the later stages of the Normandy landings and beyond, operating alongside Cromwells and Shermans to counter the German Tiger I heavy tanks. While the 17-pounder performed to expectations, the tall turret in particular presented a large and weakly armoured target for opposing tanks, though it was still shorter, more mobile, and generally preferred over the Firefly. The Challenger was also issued to Allied forces such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, the latter of which purchased a number of Challengers after the war and operated them until they were scrapped in 1959.
