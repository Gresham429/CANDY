Description of Daimler_Mk_II: 
The excellent performance of the turretless Daimler Scout Car led people to suggest that a larger armoured car version with a turret be built as well. The Daimler was similar in design but also introduced a rear-facing wheel for the commander to use in an emergency. The same turret used for the Tetrarch was employed by the Daimler. Most of their use was during the Africa Campaign, where armoured cars were crucial in the vast distances of the dessert, in situations where mobility was often more important than raw power. The tank was Britain's main reconnaissance vehicle during this time period, while it was also the heaviest of all the armoured cars fitted by the British.
