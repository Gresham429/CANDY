History of Rooikat_105: 
An upgrade and redesign program for the Rooikat was launched by Reumech OMC in 1990 for use internationally. This led to the development of the Rooikat 105 prototype with the GT-7 105 mm rifled cannon. The Rooikat 105 was made for high mobility operations taking place in both day and night. It was equipped with night vision and thermal imagery equipment for operations taking place in the dark of night. The gun used in the Rooikat 105 is the GT-7 105 mm rifled anti-tank gun. It fires a range of NATO tank shells including HEATFS, HESH and APFSDS. This gun can fire up to 6 rounds a minute (about 10 second reload). On the real version, there are two 7.62 mm machine guns for anti-infantry and anti-air, one in the turret and one in the commander's position. In-game there is only one in the turret. There are 4 smoke grenades on each side of the turret in a smoke screen configuration and the ability to use an exhaust generator. Automatic data input includes the laser rangefinder that can calculate the range of a target as well as the speed, direction of travel, wind speed, wind direction and weapon tilt. Manual data input only includes the ammunition type and the environment of its surroundings. The weapon system allows the Rooikat 105 to attack targets while on the move on rough terrain. The most complex systems of the Rooikat 105 are the gun stabiliser, the gunner's stabilised sight, the gunner's sight with night vision and the commander's individual panoramic sight.
