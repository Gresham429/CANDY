Usage of Crusader_AA_Mk_II: 
Though the Crusader AA Mk.II was meant for SPAA, the twin 20 mm cannons mean this vehicle can annihilate lightly-protected vehicles with ease, such as the 8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl. or the M15A1 CGMC, as the 20 mm will slice through the thin half-track armour to knock out the crew.
