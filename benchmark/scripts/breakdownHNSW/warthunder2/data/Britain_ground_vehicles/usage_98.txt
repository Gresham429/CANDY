Usage of Khalid: 
The Khalid can be described as "old but not obsolete": players will soon notice the flaws inherited from Chieftain series due to its early introduction, notably the protection which is identical to pre-Mk.10 Chieftains without any composite protection (especially the turret). With extra precaution according to the map and staying behind as a support tank for future tanks with overall better performance, the Khalid can still contribute to the team with its sufficient firepower and Challenger-equivalent mobility.
