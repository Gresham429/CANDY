Description of Challenger_DS: 
The Challenger was introduced in 1983, as the new MBT for the British Army. While reliability and performance were debated during the Canadian Army Trophy of 1987, their action in Operation Desert Storm, also known as the Gulf War, gave them a chance to prove their worth. In this time, the British Army deployed the 1st Armoured Division in the Middle East with 3 Armoured Brigades equipped with Challenger tanks, some of which were the latest Mk.3 variant with new ERA installed. The Challengers had a good performance, dealing with several T-55s and Type 69s while not losing a single tank. A Challenger tank holds the record for the longest tank-to-tank kill, achieving a destruction at a range of 5.1 km in 1991.
