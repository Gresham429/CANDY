Usage of Cromwell_V_(RP-3): 
The Cromwell RP-3 should not fight tanks in a head-on battle due to the relatively unsloped frontal armour. As such, the mobility of the Cromwell should be exploited to get to the blind spots of an enemy tank and fire at them from there with the 75 mm gun or the rockets.
