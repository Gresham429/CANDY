Description of Ystervark: 
The Ystervark is a self-propelled anti-aircraft (SPAA) vehicle operated by the South African Defence Force (SADF). Taking its name from the South African cape porcupine, an animal with a powerful physique protected by an astonishing array of spines to defend itself against predatory animals, a vehicle named after this species should represent those attributes. The Ystervark SPAA is a solid and robust vehicle designed to withstand the harsh South African environment. The Ystervark SPAA was developed in the 1980s in response to a mobile and mine-protected anti-air platform request. It is based on another project, Project Sireb, which produced three mine-resistant vehicles as potential replacements for the Buffel armoured personal carrier (APC). One of the three prototypes, nicknamed the "Bulldog," would serve as the foundation for the Ystervark SPAA by removing the passenger tub and replacing it with the weapons platform.
