Description of Concept_3: 
In 1976, the South African Armoured Corps issued a new project for a "New Generation Armoured Car", intended to replace the 4x4 Eland 90 in service as they were struggling to provide adequate support for the heavier Ratel IFVs in tank warfare. Three 8x8 prototypes were designed, based on the Ratel (Concept 1), Eland (Concept 2), and Alvis Saracen APC ('Concept 3), each fitted with a 77 mm high-velocity gun from retired South African Comet Is. However, after mobility trials in 1979, none of the prototypes were considered suitable and the project stalled. New requirements were issued in 1980, and further prototypes were developed, based roughly on the Concept 2, which eventually formed the basis of the Rooikat.
