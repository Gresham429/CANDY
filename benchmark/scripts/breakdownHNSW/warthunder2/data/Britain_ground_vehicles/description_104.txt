Description of Challenger_2_(2F): 
The FV4034 Challenger 2 (Dorchester Level 2F) is a modification of the Challenger 2 designed to provide enhanced protection in urban combat. First deployed in Iraq in 2004 to counter rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), the armour package provides an extra level of protection over the previous Dorchester Level 2E, featuring extra Chobham armour (non-explosive reactive armour (NERA) and ceramic composites), as well as ROMOR-A explosive reactive armour (ERA) on the front plates and Dorchester Level 2F blocks on the hull and sides. The ERA tiles are installed on a frame, which is attached to the front hull. For protection against various portable anti-tank weapons, additional external composite armour is placed on both the turret and hull sides, as well as slat armour covering the rear parts of the hull and back of the turret.
