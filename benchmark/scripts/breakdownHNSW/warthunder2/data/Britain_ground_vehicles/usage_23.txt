Usage of Churchill_I: 
This tank can use a playstyle similar to the Matilda or a weaker Churchill III. It is best played up close, to make use of the armour and also gun. Since the tank is rather boxy, it is very good at angling. Unlike the Churchill III, its gun isn't capable of taking on most other tanks of its rank. Its main role in the battlefield is to soak up and take shots, with its thick armour, that can withstand most tanks of its rank. In RB mode you will most likely have the Americans on your team, with the M10s and Shermans providing support for you. Main enemies for this tank would be the M10, the Achilles, and most Panzer IVs and StuGs.
