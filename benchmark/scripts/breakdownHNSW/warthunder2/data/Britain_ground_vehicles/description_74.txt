Description of Caernarvon: 
In 1949, work on the chassis for the new "Universal Tank" project was nearing completion. However, development of the gun and turret of what would later become the Conqueror was still yet to begin. In order to expedite testing and training, the new hull was fitted with the 20-pounder-equipped turret of the Centurion Mk 3, producing the FV 221 Caernarvon. Units were sent to the British Army of the Rhine, Bovington, Libya, and the Middle East for troop trials, identifying a number of issues with the chassis design. Once the Conqueror finally entered service in 1955, all Caernarvon units were re-equipped with the new turret and served until the Conqueror's replacement in the 1960s.
