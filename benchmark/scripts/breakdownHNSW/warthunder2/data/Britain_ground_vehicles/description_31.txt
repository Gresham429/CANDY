Description of Crusader_%22The_Saint%22: 
The Tank, Cruiser Mark VIA, Crusader II "The Saint" (A15) was a particular Crusader II assigned to the 10th Royal Hussars regiment, which was part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade, 1st Armoured Division during the North African Campaign. The 10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wale's Own) was a British Army cavalry regiment formed in 1715. It served for three centuries, during World War I and II, before combining with the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own) in October 1969 to form the Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own). When World War II broke out, the 1st Armoured Division was sent to France. It fought in northern France and Belgium before returning to England in June 1940 without any vehicles. A group of personnel were transferred in December 1940 to create the cadre of the 23rd Hussars. The regiment moved to North Africa with the 2nd Armoured Brigade in November 1941, joining the 7th Armoured Division. It saw action in Operation Crusader, the Battle of Alam el Halfa in August 1942, and the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, now armed with Crusader II tanks. The regiment seized General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, the German Deputy Commander, at El Alamein. During the Italian Campaign of 1944 and 1945, the regiment fought both as an armoured unit and as dismounted infantry.
