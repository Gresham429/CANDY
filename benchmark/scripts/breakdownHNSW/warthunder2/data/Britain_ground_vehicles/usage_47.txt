Usage of Concept_3: 
The Concept 3 will be the first iteration of the iconic 8 wheeled light vehicles that return often along the South African tech line. This vehicle is extremely large for a scout vehicle, eclipsing the Panzer IV in height and length. Concealing the Concept 3 will prove to be a difficult challenge for the player, usually finding themselves relying heavily upon its mobility to compete.
