History of FV4005: 
Work started on a 180 mm self-propelled gun in 1950 by Nuffield Mechanizations & Aero. Designated the FV215B, the plan was to mount the gun onto the Conqueror hull.[1] It was intended for the three trial vehicles to be built from the span of 1951-1955. The project was cancelled in early 1957 with no prototypes produced.[2]
