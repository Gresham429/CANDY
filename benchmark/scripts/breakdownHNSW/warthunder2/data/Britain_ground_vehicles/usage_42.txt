Usage of Churchill_VII: 
The Churchill Mk VII is a slow and manoeuvrable turtle, you're not going to break any speed records, but rest assured that if the frontal armour is facing toward the enemy, most of their shells are not able to penetrate the front of the hull and turret at your BR and below. In an uptier, you really should avoid enemy SPGs and to be careful with medium tanks, as they can destroy or fatally cripple the tank, even when you are angled.
