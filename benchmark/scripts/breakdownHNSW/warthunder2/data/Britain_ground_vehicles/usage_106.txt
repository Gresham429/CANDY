Usage of Vickers_Mk.7: 
The Vickers Mk.7 is a main battle tank, and thus a tank that should be on the frontlines being the first line of attack. It is considered one of the best armoured MBTs at its battle rating. This is due to its composition; a Leopard 2A4 hull which offers protection against all CE threats except 9M133 Kornet and is able to stop APFSDS rounds with <400 mm penetration, and a custom British turret similar to the Challenger 2 which offers protection against all CE threats except 9M133 Kornet and APFSDS rounds with <405 mm penetration. Thanks to this, the Vickers Mk.7 can be used in a variety of engagements at both short and long ranges with high chances of survivability.
