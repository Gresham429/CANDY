Description of Challenger_2_TES: 
The FV4034 Challenger 2 (Theatre Entry Standard â€“ TES) is a high-intensity battlefield modification of the standard variant of the FV4034 Challenger 2 main battle tank family. In terms of protection, the Challenger 2 TES is extremely similar to the M1 Abrams TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit). The TES system was designed to protect the tank from various threats, such as tandem warheads and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The public first saw the technology demonstrator of the Challenger 2 TES (nicknamed "Megatron") in June 2013 during the DVD defence event in Millbrook, United Kingdom. In July 2016, at the Tank Fest in Bovington, a revised modification of the Challenger 2 TES was presented, complete with a new armour design. It is outfitted with a unique combination of reactive, composite, and slat armour to provide unparalleled protection against modern warfare threats. Depending on the nature of the threats and the type of battlefield where the tank must be deployed, the Challenger 2 TES can be outfitted with changeable and modular armour packages. The mobile camouflage system (MCS) is also installed on the hull and turret to reduce the vehicle's heat signature when observed by thermal imaging equipment. The TES counter IED technology is installed on the Challenger 2 TES, as demonstrated by the array of standard and "Bird Table" antennas positioned at the upper rear of the turret. The system is used to disrupt radio or telephone signals that could be used to trigger improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
