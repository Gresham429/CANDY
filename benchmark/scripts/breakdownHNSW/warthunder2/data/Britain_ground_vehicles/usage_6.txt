Usage of Daimler_Mk_II: 
Generally, the best play style for the Daimler is to flank using a road until near the enemy and then fire from cover against enemy side armour. The Daimler is capable in both short and long-range fights. At long-range make sure to use cover and wait till the enemy looks away before exposing yourself. At close range, you can use your speed to outmanoeuvre the enemy.
