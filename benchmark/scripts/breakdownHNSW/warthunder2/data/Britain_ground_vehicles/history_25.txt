History of Gun_Carrier_(3-in): 
In 1941, the British General Staff requested tanks that can mount a high-velocity cannon. The purpose of this is to create an "expedient design to deal with enemy tanks until the 17-pounder became widespread" due to the risk of a German invasion of the British islands. None of the tanks at the time of this request had the necessary specifications to mount a heavier and larger cannon, the Churchill and Valentine tanks could only hold the 6-pounders. To fix this, it was proposed that a casemate superstructure be used in the design to hold the heavier gun instead, akin to the typical tank destroyer used by Germany and the Soviet Union at the time. The company Vauxhall was given 100 of the obsolete 3-inch guns and was tasked to produce a vehicle able to mount these guns. Designing was finished in April 1941, a mock-up was produced in July, and the first pilot vehicles were finished in early 1942, ready for testing. During these stages, the Department of Tank Design put in an order for 100 of these vehicles. The pilot vehicle was essentially a large 88 mm armoured superstructure with the 3-inch gun mounted in a ball mount, the entire thing was propelled on a Churchill chassis. The tests proved that the vehicles performed satisfactorily and could work, but with the now reduced risk of a German invasion and better equipment becoming to be more widespread, the orders placed on the vehicles wavered to only about 49 vehicles in January 1942. Production for the Carrier, Churchill, 3-inch Gun, Mk I proceeded from May 1942 to November 2, producing 50 3-inch Gun Carriers total.
