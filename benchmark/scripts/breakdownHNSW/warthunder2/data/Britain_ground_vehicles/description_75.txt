Description of Conqueror: 
Following the reveal of the IS-3 during the 1945 Victory Parade through Berlin, the British realised the need for a new heavily armed and heavily armoured tank. Plans were drawn to create a "Universal Tank" hull, which would then be able to mount a variety of different armaments to suit a range of roles. The heaviest of this set of planned vehicles was the Conqueror, armed with a 120 mm gun inspired by and developed alongside that of the American M103, designed to be able to face down any Soviet threats and provide long-range anti-tank support for the existing Centurion.
