History of Grant_I: 
After the development of the M2 medium tank, the Battle of France showed that such a tank was not going to be capable to go up against the German Panzer III and Panzer IV. With the Western Allies now embroiled in the North African campaign against the Germans and Italians, the Allies needed a good tank capable of going against the Panzer tanks, and they needed it quickly.
