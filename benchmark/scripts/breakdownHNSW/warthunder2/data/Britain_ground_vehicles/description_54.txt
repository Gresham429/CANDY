Description of TOG_II: 
The TOG II is a prototype super-heavy tank designed in 1940 by the Special Vehicle Development Committee a.k.a "The Old Gang", which consisted of the original designers of British tanks during World War I. The tank is a follow-up design of the TOG I, which was designed with the expectation that the next world war would devolve into static trench warfare much like the first. To achieve this, the TOG II has a very long and relatively narrow hull to help it traverse trenches effectively, and at one point even planned to be equipped with sponson turrets to ward off infantry attacks from the sides. As speed was not a priority, the TOG II's top speed was expected to be around 25 km/h, though in reality it could only achieve 13.7 km/h due to its sheer weight.
