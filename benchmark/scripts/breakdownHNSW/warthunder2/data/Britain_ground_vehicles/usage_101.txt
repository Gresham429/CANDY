Usage of Challenger_Mk.2: 
New drivers of the Challenger 1 will appreciate a similar playstyle to the earlier Chieftain tanks, particularly the Chieftain Mk 10. Most of the armour's weak points could be minimized by assuming a hull-down position on the incline of a hill, and using the Challenger's excellent -10Â° of gun depression to keep the gun on target. This will increase the angle of the turret and thus increase the effective thickness of the back-plate on the turret.
