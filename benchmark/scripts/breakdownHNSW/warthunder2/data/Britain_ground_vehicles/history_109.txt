History of Challenger_DS: 
After the introduction of Challenger in 1983 as the new MBT for the British Army in different units, there were debates on its reliability due to its inferior overall performance in the Canadian Army Trophy of 1987. As the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990 and the subsequent Operation Desert Storm (Gulf War) began in 1991, the Challengers were given the chance to show their worth.
