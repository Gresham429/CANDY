Description of Sherman_IC_%22Trzyniec%22: 
The M4 Sherman IC Firefly "Trzyniec" is a heavily up-gunned modification of the first variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. During World War II, the M4 Sherman IC Firefly operated with both the Polish 1st Armoured Division in northern Europe and the Polish 2nd Armoured Brigade in Italy. It saw limited service in the Polish Army since the majority of the tanks were assigned to the British Army to combat the more advanced German tanks. The lower hulls of the M4 Sherman IC Firefly distinguish it from the M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly, with the M4 Sherman IC Firefly having a shorter hull and smaller gaps between the suspension components, as it is based on the M4 or "Sherman I" chassis instead of the regular M4A4 or "Sherman V". This also made use of a three-piece bolted transmission casing. The M4 Sherman IC Firefly, on the other hand, typically had a cast transmission casing. The rest of the characteristics are the same.
