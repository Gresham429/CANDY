Description of Centurion_Mk.2: 
The Centurion Mk 2 was the second variant of the Centurion medium tank family. The Centurion Mk 1 was widely regarded as a success, but the Soviet tank threat necessitated the development of a more heavily armoured version, known as the Centurion Mk 2. It also possessed a brand-new, completely cast turret. The Centurion Mk 1 was swiftly replaced on the production line, with 800 Centurion Mk 2 ordered in November 1945 from Leyland Motors and Vickers (Elswick), the Royal Ordnance Factories in Leeds and Woolwich. A newly developed two-plane fully automatic stabilization system for the 76 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder tank gun is also included in the Centurion Mk 2. The Centurion Mk 2 entered service with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment in December 1946. All Centurion Mk 1s and 2s were converted to recovery vehicles or modified to the Centurion Mk 3 standards after production was replaced by the Centurion Mk 3.
