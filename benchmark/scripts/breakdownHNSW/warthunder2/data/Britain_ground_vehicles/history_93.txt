History of Rooikat_Mk.1D: 
During the mid 1970s, the South African armed forces issued a specification which kickstarted the development of the "New Generation Armoured Car" project. The aim of the project, as the name suggests, was the development of a new heavy armoured car that would replace dated existing designs in the near future.
