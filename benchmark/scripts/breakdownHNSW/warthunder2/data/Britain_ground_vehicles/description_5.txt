Description of Tetrarch_I: 
Development for this tank started in 1937 by Vickers-Armstrongs privately as the Light Tank Mk VII and nicknamed the Purdah. The trials tested the tank's ability to act as a "light cruiser", but this failed as the A13 cruiser was much better at the task. Thus, it was suggested that the Mk VII be tested as a light tank instead and production to be started for the trials. The Tetrarch was first issued in November 1940 to the 1st and 6th Armoured Division, the 1st had lost most of their equipment in the Battle of France and the 6th was a newly formed unit. While these units were sent to North Africa, the defects in the engine cooling system forced the Tetrarchs to stay behind, until they were taken out of armoured divisions due to the "light tank" concept becoming obsolete. Most of the Tetrarchs were shipped overseas and the Soviet Union compared their role to that of the T-70 light tank, they were mainly used for reconnaissance and for airborne operations.
