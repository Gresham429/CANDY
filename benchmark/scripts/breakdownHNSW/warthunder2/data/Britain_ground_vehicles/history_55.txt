History of QF_3.7_Ram: 
In 1941, General Frederick 'Frank' Worthington, founder of the Canadian Armoured Corps, proposed that a 3.7-inch (94 mm) anti-aircraft gun be mounted on a Ram chassis to act as a dual purpose anti-aircraft and anti-tank vehicle. The 3.7-inch (94 mm) Ordnance Quick Firing (OQF) MK II was used because it was the primary British heavy AA gun during World War II. The vehicle designed mounted the OQF Mk II on the Ram hull (a Canadian tank based on the M3 Lee's hull).
