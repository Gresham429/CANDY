Description of Valentine_XI: 
The Tank, Infantry, Valentine XI was a British infantry tank. Its development started as a private venture of Vickers-Armstrong in 1938, based on experience with the A9, A10 and A11 cruiser and infantry tank designs. The War Office initially wasn't satisfied with only a two-man turret: a three-man turret was fitted so the commander would not become overwhelmed with tasks during battle. With the situation in Europe worsening, the design was approved in April 1939 and first deliveries were made in May 1940. The Valentine XI was an upgunned version of the earlier X, featuring an Ordnance QF 75 mm gun and 210 hp GMC 6004 diesel engine; the armour was also welded rather than riveted. Nearly all variants of the Valentine tank except Mk I were sent to USSR as part of the Lend-Lease act.
