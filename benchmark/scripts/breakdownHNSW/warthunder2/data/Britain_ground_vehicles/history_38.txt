History of Challenger: 
The development of the Cromwell tank due to the implementation of the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine helped Roy Robotham from Rolls to become the Minstry of Supply on the Tank Board, despite his lack of experience around the development of tanks. With the Cromwell in service with the British military, attempts were made to upgrade the armament on the tank from its 6-pounder and 75 mm gun. The first attempt was by Vickers with a "high-velocity" 75 mm gun, but the Cromwell turret ring proved too small for the adaption. While these attempts were made to upgun the Cromwell, improved tanks to replace the Cromwell was underway as the Comet and the Centurion tank. The General Staff specification for a 17-pounder armed cruiser tank was A29, but this was changed to A30 for any 17-pounder tank. The first order for such a tank came in 1942 to the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company to build the 17-pounder tank from the components of the A27M Cromwell tank. While responsibility of the turret and gun mounting went to Stothert & Pitt, Birmingham was responsible for modifying the Cromwell hull for the new turret.
