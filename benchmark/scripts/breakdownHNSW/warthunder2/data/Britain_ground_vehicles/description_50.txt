Description of A.C.IV: 
Australia began the development of the A.C.IV Sentinel as the A.C.I intended to fulfil the role of a cruiser tank. A commission was sent to the US to investigate the M3 Medium Tank since Australia lacked any kind of experience in armour development. It was decided to try a concept similar to the Canadian Ram, using the M3 as a basis and working around its design. Some other parts of the design were also based on the British Crusader tank. The tank was meant to be armed with a 2-pounder gun, but this was increased to a 6-pounder in future variants. The final version, the A.C.IV, was developed to use the new and more powerful British QF 17-pounder gun, capable of dealing with the best German tanks at the time. The turret ring was also increased to 70 inches, for greater crew comfort.
