Description of Sherman_Firefly: 
The M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly is a heavily up-gunned modification of the fifth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. The M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly was one of the few Allied tanks that the Germans learned to fear during World War II, from the hedgerows of Normandy, France, to the hills of Italy and the plains of the Netherlands. It was a clever, though risky, and improvised effort to try to keep up with the latest German tank innovations. It was one of the most powerful Allied adaptations of the war and undoubtedly one of the deadliest modifications of any M4 Sherman variants during World War II. Armed with the superb 76 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder tank gun, this stopgap combination (before the arrival of the new generation of Allied tanks) was one of the most lethal tanks of its day, adding its weight to the Allied struggle to secure victory. After the challenge of fitting such a massive gun into the turret was addressed, the M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly went into production in early 1944, just in time to equip General Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the Normandy landings. It quickly proved valuable because its gun could nearly always penetrate the armour of the German tanks it faced in Normandy, which no other British tank could accomplish reliably. Before production halted in 1945, between 2,100 and 2,200 units had been manufactured.
