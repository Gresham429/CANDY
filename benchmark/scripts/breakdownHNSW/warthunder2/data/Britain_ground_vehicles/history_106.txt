History of Vickers_Mk.7: 
After quite a few private tank ventures, and the unsatisfactory development of the Vickers Mark 4, also known as Valiant. The Vickers company brought another design aimed to develop a capable MBT. Either as a replacement for the Challenger Mk.1 then currently in service, or as a valuable modern tank for the exportation. With the support of the Krauss-Maffei company, Vickers matched the up-rated turret of the previous Mark 4 Valiant MBT, with an identical Leopard 2A4 chassis. Thus creating in June 1985, what it became known as Vickers MBT Mark 7.
