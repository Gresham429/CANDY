Usage of FV4005: 
The main in-game use of this tank is the elimination of hull-down tanks (similar to T30), super-armoured heavy tanks in general (similar to IS-7), well-armoured SPG's (similar to Ho-Ri) and the likes of them. Meanwhile, you still can help your team by hiding around and eliminating reckless rushers in 1 hit, when they aren't looking.
