Description of Archer: 
The introduction of the 17-pounder anti-tank gun into British service gave the British forces firepower capable of destroying the heavier German tanks; however, the gun's heavyweight and bulkiness presented a mobility issue for the crew. A Valentine chassis was chosen to be modified in order to fit the new gun. The modified Valentine, known as the Self Propelled 17pdr, Valentine, Mk.I, Archer, was given a more powerful engine and a casemate superstructure on the front. The most distinctive feature of the Archer compared to any other tank destroyers in the war was that its gun is not facing forward, rather to the rear. The Archer was used on the Italian front and in the European campaign against Germany. As a self-propelled gun, the Royal Artillery had authority over the tank destroyer just like other tank destroyers in British service. Reception to the Archer revealed that the crews favoured the Archer over the M10 Achilles due to the better tactics the Archer presented by shooting then speeding away before the enemy could discover them.
