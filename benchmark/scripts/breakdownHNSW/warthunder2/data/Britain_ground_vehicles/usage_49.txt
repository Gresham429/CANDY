Usage of Sherman_IC_%22Trzyniec%22: 
This tank should be the supporting line in both offensive and defensive actions, providing flanking fire, long-range fire, or fast and accurate fire to the target while the heavy tanks like the Churchills take up the brunt of the defence. The tank is as mobile as the M4 Sherman, so picking up speed to get around the enemy is not hard. Those familiar with an M4 Sherman control will pick up on this tank very easily; however unlike most Sherman variants, the Firefly does not equip any kind of stabilisation. While this tank is also capable of being the frontal attack unit for an assault, it is strongly advised not to due to the thin armour of the tank, necessitating the users to always get the first shot off in an encounter, otherwise the enemy will be able to destroy the Firefly easily.
