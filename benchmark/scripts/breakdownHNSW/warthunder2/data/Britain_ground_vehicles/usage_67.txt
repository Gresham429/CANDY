Usage of G6: 
It is very difficult to use the G6 in Arcade battles, although not as difficult as the FV4005. At 136% visibility, it is extremely vulnerable to being spotted by random scouts, and is an easy target for aircraft. While AB mitigates many of the aforementioned issues with weapon handling and mobility, the playstyle of quick and aggressive combat does not suit the G6, so you will be stuck sniping, preferably on bigger maps with ranges over 800 m.
