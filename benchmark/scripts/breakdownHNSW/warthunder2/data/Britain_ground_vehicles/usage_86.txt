Usage of Vickers_Mk.11: 
Against all odds, this tank is a rather good first vehicle on hilly and somewhat open maps. While it doesn't have any armour, players really hate to fire on the move while moving towards their first objective, so on medium to small maps, you can easily send 1 to 3 people back to the spawn while driving to the capture or vantage point of choice simply because the truck is absolutely stable and the gun is easy to aim after minimal practice. This initial assault is particularly effective against teams mainly consisting of Soviet or Chinese tanks, as they are way less compatible with hills due to their issues with gun depression and are unlikely to hunker down and snipe you from the very start. Any other targets can be scouted for free points and cover from your teammates.
