History of Black_Prince: 
The Black Prince is an experimental design that was to use the British Infantry tank, the Churchill, as the basis with much more armour and a better gun. The name originates from Edward of Woodstock, otherwise known as the "Black Prince", a 14th century military leader. The Churchill and its branch of infantry tanks, in the course of World War II, was becoming slightly obsolete in the highly mobile style of warfare the cruiser tanks proved much better at. The infantry tanks were originally made for heavy, breakthrough style of warfare with infantry, so they were kept around in a style of "heavy tanks", but the Axis' gradually increasing anti-tank capacity caused the armour of the infantry tanks to be considered insufficient.
