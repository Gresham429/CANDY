Usage of Matilda_III: 
If attacking, the Matilda should take point in the attacking force (if your team will wait for you) and crawl slowly towards the enemy locations with support from your team members. Stop and fire at any target that reveals itself to attack you. When defending, park some distance away from a choke point to a vital area and blast enemies as they try to enter. Remember to maintain team support so that enemies don't try to out manoeuvre you. Make sure to keep a safe distance away from the enemy to maximise the effectiveness of your armour with the shell damage drop-off. Like this, your armour will be very hard to penetrate. At the same time use the 2-pounder gun to attack the enemy. Close-distance fighting is ill-advised as opponents will be able to more easily penetrate the front armour and find weak points. A very important tip to know about the Matilda III is to not go into towns. You will be easily outmanoeuvred, allowing your opponents to get close and flank and destroy you.
