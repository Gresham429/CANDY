Description of Charioteer_Mk_VII: 
The Tank Medium Gun Charioteer Mk VII (or just Charioteer) is a rank IV British medium tank 
with a battle rating of 6.0 (AB/SB) and 6.3 (RB). It was introduced in Update 1.55 "Royal Armour" alongside the rest of the initial British Ground Forces Tree. The Charioteer takes the hull of a Cromwell and replaces the turret with a larger one mounting the heavy-hitting 84 mm 20-pdr cannon, which can deal with the enemies it faces at Rank IV.
