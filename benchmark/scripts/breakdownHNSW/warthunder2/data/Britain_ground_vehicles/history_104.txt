History of Challenger_2_(2F): 
The Challenger 2 (2F) is an upgraded version of the Challenger 2, featuring the Theatre Entry Standard (TES) kit. Rather than being a single modification, the TES is updated as new threats and/or technologies emerge. The TES aims to increase the protection levels against the operational threats of the British Army such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), hollow charges, or tandem charges - common threats during suburban deployments.
