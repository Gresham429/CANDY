History of SARC_MkIVa: 
The South African Reconnaissance Car (SARC), known in British service as the Marmon-Herrington[1], had a remarkably diverse pedigree, as it combined components made in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, put together in South Africa.Â  The service record of its variants was similarly far-flung, despite its relatively small production numbers, as it saw service in WW2, Cyprus, across Africa, and even (from captured Japanese stock) Indonesia.[2]
