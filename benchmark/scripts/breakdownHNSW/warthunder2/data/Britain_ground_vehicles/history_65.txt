History of Ratel_90: 
The Ratel 90 was based on the Ratel 20 but with significant changes. The main feature of the Ratel 90 is a Denel DT-2 90 mm low velocity gun in the turret from the Eland 90 armoured car. Additionally, the hull roof was reinforced and the amount of troop hatches on top was reduced from four to two. Space for one of the passengers was removed to provide space for more 90 mm ammunition.
