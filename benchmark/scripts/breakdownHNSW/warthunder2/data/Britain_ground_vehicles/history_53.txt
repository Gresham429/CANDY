History of Churchill_Crocodile: 
With the First World War bringing about the development of the tank and the flamethrower, different nations would devise ways to combine the two into a single weapon system during the interwar period. A mobile armoured flamethrower would allow the short-ranged weapon system to get close to the enemy with minimal risk from small-arms fire.
