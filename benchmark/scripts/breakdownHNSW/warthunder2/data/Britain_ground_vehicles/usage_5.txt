Usage of Tetrarch_I: 
This tank is all about mobility: it can nearly go anywhere fast, surprising the enemy. Being one of the smallest vehicles in game, the Tetrarch will be able to roll through the thinnest passages at high speed. Its short hull enables it to cross hilly woods and rocky ground without ditching. On gear 1, it can climb any hill, as long as it sticks to the ground, thus reaching advantageous spots from where it can snipe using its good gun depression, showing only its tiny turret. Although, it is recommended to change position often since anyone knowing where the Tetrarch is can pin it down easily (remember that the Tetrarch only have 3 crew members and thin armour). Consider flanking with this vehicle since it has such a good speed but beware the Tetrarch's slow turret slewing rate, so pre-aim the cannon in the expected direction of the enemy.
