Description of Churchill_VII: 
The Tank, Infantry, Mk IV, Churchill VII (A22F) (or just Churchill VII) is a rank III British heavy tank 
with a battle rating of 4.7 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.55 "Royal Armour" along with the rest of the initial British Ground Forces Tree. A lumbering beast made of pure steel, the Churchill Mk VII is the epitome of a "walking giant" which you do not want to have staring down at you. With 152 mm of armour, it is one of the most heavily protected tanks in Rank III, even if its firepower seems pitiful for such a tank.
