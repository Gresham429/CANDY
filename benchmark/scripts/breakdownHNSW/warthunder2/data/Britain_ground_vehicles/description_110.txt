Description of Challenger_2_(YouTube_Cup): 
The Challenger 2 started development shortly after the introduction of the Challenger 1, since Vickers anticipated that new requirements for a next generation MBT will eventually arrive, when this were sent Vickers immediately submitted their proposal for the Challenger 2. Even when put against other western MBTs like the Leopard 2, Leclerc and M1 Abrams the Challenger 2 was able to complete the test and was found to be a successful proposal. The first Challenger 2 tanks were delivered to the tank regiments by 1994. The Challenger 2 participated in several operations during the '90s and into the 2000s, ranging from peacekeeping missions on the Balkans to military interventions in Iraq. A number of Challenger 2 MBTs have also been exported to Oman, with this nation being the only operator of the Challenger 2, besides the UK. Since 2008 the Challenger 2 has been upgraded with new defensive systems and upgrades to the electronic equipment.
