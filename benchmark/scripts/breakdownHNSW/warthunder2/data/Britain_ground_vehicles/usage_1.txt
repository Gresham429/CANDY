Usage of A13_Mk_I: 
This vehicle's role is that of a light tank in the truest sense, sporting a potent gun, great mobility and virtually no armour to speak of. It is ill-advised to use the A13 as a frontline tank. Instead, use your mobility to your advantage: spot, flank and provide support for your teammates, blind your enemies with well-placed smokes screens in key avenues. Make sure to prioritize targeting secluded enemies in flanking tactics so you can take full advantage of the element of surprise and outflank your opponent. Never expose yourself for too long as even anti-aircraft guns are a potential threat to your non-angled armour. The QF 2-pounder has an awful long-range accuracy so you must get close to your enemies to actually land a shot where you expect. Load up this agile (but reluctant) cat with ammo and flank your enemies with a constant flow of bullets.
