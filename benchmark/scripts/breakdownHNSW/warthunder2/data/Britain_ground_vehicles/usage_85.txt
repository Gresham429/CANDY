Usage of Vickers_Mk.3: 
There are multiple ways to play this tank. The most common way is utilising your good acceleration and speed to get into key sniping points on the map. Here the use of your laser rangefinder can help you snipe up to 2 km effectively. For this role, APDS is recommended due to its higher velocity than the HEATFS shell and yet still have decent penetration. Use your first shot to make the enemy tank immobile and then finish them off as it is highly unlikely they shall be able to locate you at a distance, find the proper range (unless they they happen to also have laser rangefinders which is more likely in a uptier battle) and then shoot you. To snipe, it is also advised to go hull-down and use the 10* of gun depression to reduce the amount of area exposed to enemy fire. Although not comparable to other tanks at its BR, the reverse speed of 11 km/h is still decent to get out of sticky situations.
