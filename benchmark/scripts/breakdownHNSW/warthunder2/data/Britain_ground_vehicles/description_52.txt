Description of Excelsior: 
The Tank, Heavy Assault, A33 (Excelsior) was developed after early combat experience with Churchill infantry tanks. These tanks had very poor reliability and were also very slow for the modern battlefield. Thus, while the prototype A27 Cromwell was being developed, it was decided to use the A27 as a basis for a new universal tank meant to replace the cruiser and infantry tanks and combine them into a single vehicle. In 1942, the project was approved and the A33 Excelsior was born. However, the issues with the Churchill were fixed by 1943 and cruiser tanks were replaced by American M4 Shermans, thus the Excelsior was no longer needed and the project was cancelled.
