Usage of Centurion_Mk_10: 
The Centurion Mk 10 should feel familiar to players coming from the Centurion Mk 3. The 105 mm L7A1 features high penetration and precision at long range, especially with the high-velocity APDS ammunition, capable of penetrating the upper glacis of a Tiger II. The increased hull armour and thicker gun mantlet make it more resilient against poorly aimed shots, while the tank also retains its great mobility, though it still suffers from having a low top speed.
