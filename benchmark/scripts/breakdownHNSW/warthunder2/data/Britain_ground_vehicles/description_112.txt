Description of Bhishma_TWMP: 
The T-90S Bhishma TWMP (भीष्म, a character in Indian epic Mahabharata; Object 188S) is an exported T-90 built in Russia and also license-produced in India by the Heavy Vehicles Factory. India purchased 310 T-90S in 2001 as complete assembled or knock-down kits as part of their military modernization program, and a further 330 tanks would be produced locally by the HVF as well since 2006. Most of the features of a standard T-90A (Object 188A1) are identical on the T-90S, as the Russian Army later adopted the latter as the new MBT in 2005. In this case, a domestically developed mine plough by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is installed on the tank as an alternative to Russian mine ploughs.
