Usage of Bhishma_TWMP: 
To describe T-90S, for the tanks of lower rank, it is like an Indian Elephant which charges into the masses of enemy infantry; for the users of T-90S, they can still take it by its name - Bhishma, a warrior in epic. If players can adopt Soviet tactics while playing British tech-tree in this case (but most of all, be cautious), they can achieve respectable results against enemies.
