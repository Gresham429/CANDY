History of G6: 
The G6 Rhino is a Self-Propelled Howitzer, designed and developed by the Lyttelton Engineering Works (now Denel Land Systems, a division of Denel) throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. An indigenous design of South Africa, it was intended to replace the WWII-era Sexton of Canadian origin. The development of an indigenous design as opposed to the purchase of foreign arms is often attributed to the arms embargo (UNSC Resolution 418) on South Africa, passed unanimously by all major world powers - a response to the ongoing apartheid system of racial segregation, as well as escalation of the South African Border War with nearby countries.
