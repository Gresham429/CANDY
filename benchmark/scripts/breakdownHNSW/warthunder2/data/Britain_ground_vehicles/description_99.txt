Description of Rooikat_105: 
In 1990, a programme was initiated by Reumech OMC to upgrade the Rooikat for the international market, with the intent of increasing its potency against other armoured vehicles. It was upgunned with the GT-7 105 mm cannon, a domestic variant of the ubiquitous Royal Ordnance L7 built by Denel, and made able to accept a range of NATO ammunition to improve compatibility with any potential customers. It was also equipped with updated features such as a new thermal imaging system. The Rooikat 105 was completed in 1994 and demonstrated to the SANDF, who decided that they were satisfied with the base model. The subsequent offering on the export market was also met with a lack of interest. Only a single prototype of the vehicle was ever constructed.
