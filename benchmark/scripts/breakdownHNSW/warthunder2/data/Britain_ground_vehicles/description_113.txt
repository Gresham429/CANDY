Description of Black_Night: 
The FV4034 Challenger 2 (Black Night) is a technology demonstrator for BAE Systems' proposal for the Challenger 2 life extension project (LEP), intended to provide a series of modernisations that would extend the service life of the Challenger 2 MBT until 2035. The Black Night has several new enhancements, mainly around the turret, including a Safran Paseo commander's independent sight, a Leonardo thermal imager for the gunner, and a Leonardo night sight DNVS 4 to provide hunter-killer capabilities thanks to thermal imaging equipment for the gunner, commander, and driver. Other additions included a laser warning system and the IMI Iron First hard-kill active protection system. BAE Systems first showcased the Black Night at the Defense Vehicle Dynamics expo in September 2018. However, it was quickly superseded by the Rheinmetall proposal, featuring a completely redesigned turret and smoothbore gun. The Challenger 2 LEP itself has resulted in the development of the Challenger 3, a major upgrade of the platform undertaken in a joint venture by BAE and Rheinmetall to be in operation by 2030.
