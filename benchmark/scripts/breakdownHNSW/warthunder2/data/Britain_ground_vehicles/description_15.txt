Description of Crusader_III: 
The Tank, Cruiser Mark VIB, Crusader III (A15) is the third variant of the A15 Crusader cruiser tank family. Due to design delays with the British Army's seventh cruiser tank, the Cavalier (A24), the Crusader III was the first British tank to be equipped with the 57 mm Ordnance QF 6-pounder tank gun. An extractor fan was also installed in the turret to remove fumes produced by the tank gun's fire. The tank crew was reduced to three as the larger tank gun limited turret space. To make room for ammunition storage, the auxiliary turret was removed. The Crusader III was also equipped with the Mark IV Liberty engine, which solved many of the earlier reliability difficulties. Production began in May 1942, with 144 units completed by July. The Crusader III first saw service in October 1942, with approximately 100 units taking part in the Second Battle of El Alamein.
