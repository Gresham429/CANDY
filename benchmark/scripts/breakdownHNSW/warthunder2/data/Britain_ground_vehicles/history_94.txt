History of Olifant_Mk.1A: 
The Olifant Mk.1 was a South African conversion of Centurion Mk.3s tanks to a modified standard[1]. Conversions began in 1979 and lasted until 1984; a total of 153 Olifant Mk.1s were converted from Centurion Mk.3 tanks. Not long after the Olifant Mk.1 entered production, T-55 tanks were obtained and tested which revealed flaws in the Olifant Mk.1 by comparison. Fortunately for the SADF, an upgrade of the Olifant Mk.1 was already under development.
