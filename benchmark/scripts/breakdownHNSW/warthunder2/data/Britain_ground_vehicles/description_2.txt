Description of A13_Mk_II: 
The Tank, Cruiser, Mark IVA (A13 Mark II) is the late-production second variant of the A13 cruiser tank family. In contrast to the early-production variant, which was simply an A13 Mark I with increased turret armour, the A13 Mark II, also known as A13 Mark IIA, was produced with extra hull armour. The tank was utilized in France in 1940 and in the early stages of the war in North Africa before being retired. It was perhaps the greatest light tank Britain had in 1940, as it was a speedy vehicle compared to other British tanks of the early part of the war. There were 955 of these tanks produced in all.
