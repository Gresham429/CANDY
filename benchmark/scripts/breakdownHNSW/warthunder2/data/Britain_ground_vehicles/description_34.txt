Description of Matilda_Hedgehog: 
The Matilda Hedgehog was an Australian late-war experiment of the early but legendary Matilda infantry tank. Developed in early 1944, it was equipped with the Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The tank was needed after the Australian Forces encountered difficulties dealing with Japanese bunkers in the jungles of the Asian front. The Matilda II was chosen to be the carrier of this weapon since it was already a combat proven infantry tank. However, testing of the new design went too far, even considering not using the Matilda and instead using the M3 Lee, thus the war ended before the tank was ready for frontline service.
