Usage of Conway: 
Conway's play style is not very different from that of the Object 120 Taran. Both vehicles are quite large, making them large and easy to spot targets, with very powerful guns. The Conway's characteristics promotes the sniper play style, with the the incredible penetration and ballistic performance of the Shot L1G allowing the Conway to engage from extreme distances with relative ease. In order to maximise the post-penetration damage of the APDS round, it is usually advised to aim for the center of the target, otherwise the chance of destroying an enemy, with just one shot, drops dramatically.  However, unlike the Taran, Conway's mobility is mediocre (except for the reverse speed) which, combined with the tank's size, make moving into sniping positions quite difficult, so it's important to watch your surroundings for any enemies trying to take you out. This also makes flanking very risky.
