Description of FV4005: 
Following the debut of the IS-3 in 1945 and amidst fears that the Soviet Union would continue developing increasingly heavy tanks, a requirement was drawn up in 1950 for a tank with a gun capable of defeating a 152 mm armour plate sloped at 60Â° from up to 2 km. However, it was quickly realised that even the most powerful Allied guns of the time, namely the 120 mm cannon of the Conqueror and the American 155 mm mounted to tanks such as the T30, were not able to perform such a feat. Instead, a new 183 mm cannon was developed, firing HESH shells to allow both anti-armour and anti-fortification use. It was originally planned to mount the new gun on the same "Universal tank" hull as the Conqueror. However, this would take significant development, so it was decided to initially provide a stop-gap measure by utilising the hull of the Centurion, becoming the FV4005. The first prototype ("Stage I") mounted the gun in an open turret, featuring a concentric gun recoil system, mechanised loading assistance, and a recoil spade mounted on the rear of the chassis to allow the vehicle to dig in when firing. Following from this, "Stage II" featured a light but fully enclosed turret, doing away with the loading assist by providing space for an extra loader, as well as replacing the concentric recoil system with a new hydropneumatic version. However, the IS-3 and its developments did not materialise in as great numbers as was feared, and the project was officially cancelled in 1957.
