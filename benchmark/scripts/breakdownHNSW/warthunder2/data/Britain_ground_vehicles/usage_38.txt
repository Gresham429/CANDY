Usage of Challenger: 
This tank has a high penetration gun (with APDS), great manoeuvrability, and good speed. However, it has extremely weak armour, terrible reverse, and quite a high profile. As such it requires some skill to use. It excels as a sniper or an ambushing tank destroyer, waiting for the enemy to come into its sights and firing from a point of advantage. It is also a good flanker due to its speed and manoeuvrability getting around the enemy and hitting them from the side or back.
