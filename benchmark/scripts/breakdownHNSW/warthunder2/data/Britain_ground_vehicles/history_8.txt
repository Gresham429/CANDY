History of Staghound_AA: 
The T17E2 started as an armoured car requested by US Army Ordnance in July 1941. The request asked for a medium armoured car for combat services. Two companies, Ford Motor Company and Chevrolet, submitted designs to this request, Ford's was an all driven 6x6 wheeled vehicle and Chevrolet's was an all driven 4x4 wheeled vehicle. These two were called T17 and T17E1 respectively, both were powered by two Hercules JXD engines in order to standardize on parts. These two vehicles were to use a turret developed by Rock Island Arsenal with a 37 mm cannon and machine guns, this would house a crew of five. Despite their development, the United States interest on the design waned and were never adopted fully by their armed forces, instead taking in the lighter M8 Greyhound car and using the T17 until the M8 production could be started. Had it been adopted, it would've been designated the M6.
