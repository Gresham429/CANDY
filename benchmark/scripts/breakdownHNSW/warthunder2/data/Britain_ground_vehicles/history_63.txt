History of Conway: 
When the Centurion tanks entered service in British service in 1945, the British didn't take into account the sudden appearance of the Soviet IS-3. The IS-3 tank showed the Western Allies needed to reconsider their tank inventories, which at the time the IS-3 was introduced only composed of mostly M4 Sherman, M26 Pershing, and Centurions. The British, recognizing the need for a bigger gun to fight the IS-3, started producing the Conqueror. However, development takes time and the Conqueror would not be ready until 1955. As an interim project until it is done, the British took a Centurion Mk 3 tank and upgraded with a new turret made from rolled plate that can mount the 120 mm L1 gun, the same gun meant for the Conqueror. This vehicle, designated the FV4004 Conway was to have the heavy armament, yet the same manoeuvrability as the base Centurion. One of such vehicle was made in this matter before the whole thing was cancelled in 1951. The sole piece made is now stored at the Bovington Tank Museum.
