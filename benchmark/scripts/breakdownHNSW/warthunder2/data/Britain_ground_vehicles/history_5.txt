History of Tetrarch_I: 
Development for this tank started in 1937 by Vickers-Armstrongs privately as the Light Tank Mk VII and nicknamed the Purdah.[1]. The intention was for the tank to be sold to either the British Army or foreign countries as the latest light tank of the company. Its predecessor, the Mk VIB Light Tank, was considered insufficient in firepower, armed with only machine guns. The new design would use the new 2-pounder gun along with a coaxial machine gun. The Mk VII design was finished around 1938, and the British War Office (government administrating the British Army) took up the design for trials in May 1938 that lasted until June. The trials tested the Mk VII's ability to act as a "light cruiser", but this failed as the A13 cruiser was much better at the task. Thus, it was suggested that the Mk VII be tested as a light tank instead and production to be started for the trials. During the trials, the War Office gave the Mk VII the specification number A17 for identification and was put into limited production in November 1938 with a few design changes. It was initially known as the "Purdah" from its standardization date, but in September 22, 1941, the Mk VII Light Tank also received the name Tetrarch as part of an order to distinguish tanks by chosen names.
