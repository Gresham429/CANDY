Description of Vickers_Mk.11: 
The Vickers Mk.11 is a rank VI British light tank 
with a battle rating of 8.7 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update "Kings of Battle". This is more of a sniper tank with abilities of a scout, retaining bus-like behaviour of Ratel 90 and G6, rather than opting for the shock-and-awe fighting style like the Rooikat Mk.1D.
