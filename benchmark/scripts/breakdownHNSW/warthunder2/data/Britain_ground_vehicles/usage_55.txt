Usage of QF_3.7_Ram: 
In Realistic/Simulator battles, one of the best approaches is the sniping role as the 44 shells available are sufficient for prolonged sniper duties. Quickly find an appropriate spot at the beginning of the match. The vehicle is tall and the gun depression is only of -5Â° so keep that in mind when positioning. Covering the allies flanks, long roads, taking down enemy snipers, or keeping the enemy from capturing a point shall be your duty. This tactic can be more successful with camouflage on the frontal armour. Concealing the QF Ram in the woods as well as hiding the exposed loaders in the back from easy picking.
