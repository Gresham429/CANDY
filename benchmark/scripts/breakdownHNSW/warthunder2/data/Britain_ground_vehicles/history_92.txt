History of ZA-35: 
The ZA-35 was a South African self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) variant of the Rooikat armoured car and designed in the 1990s. It was developed by Armaments Corporation of South Africa (ARMSCOR) and one prototype or possibly more was built before the project was cancelled. Had it entered production the ZA-35 would have served in a battery of three ZA-35 SPAAGs, one ZA-HVM surface-to-air missile launcher (also based on the Rooikat hull), and a local warning radar.[1]
