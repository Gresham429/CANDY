Description of Bosvark: 
The Bosvark is a self-propelled anti-aircraft (SPAA) vehicle named after the African Bushpig, which is armed with powerful tusks for digging up roots and defending itself against predators. The South African Defence Force (SADF) seized considerable amounts of 23 mm ZU-23-2 twin-barrelled autocannons from the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) during the South African Border War, which lasted from 1966 to 1989. The MPLA had obtained these from Cuban and Soviet benefactors. The SADF employed these weapons for a variety of purposes, including base defence, makeshift weapons platforms, and training. Early in 1990, the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (ARMSCOR) issued a request for proposals based on end-user specifications established by the SADF to mount the captured 23 mm ZU-23-2 twin-barrelled autocannons (also known as GA-6 in the SADF) on a vehicle. The vehicle had to be mine-resistant, according to the key development criteria. The SAMIL 100 KwÃªvol transport vehicle was chosen as it met the specifications for an armoured crew compartment, a mine-protected chassis, and a large rear deck on which to put the weapon platform.
