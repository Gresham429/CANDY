Description of Crusader_AA_Mk_I: 
The Crusader III Anti-Aircraft Mark I is the first anti-air modification of the Crusader III, which is the third variant of the A15 Crusader cruiser tank family. The original 57 mm Ordnance QF 6-pounder was replaced with a 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun in an open-topped turret with an autoloader and automated turret. The crew consisted of four people: the commander, the gunner, the loader, and the driver. Beginning with the Normandy landing, the Crusader III Anti-Aircraft Mark I was issued to artillery light anti-aircraft regiments, but they were withdrawn from service soon after D-Day due to Allied air superiority and a lack of Luftwaffe targets, necessitating much fewer anti-aircraft platforms.
