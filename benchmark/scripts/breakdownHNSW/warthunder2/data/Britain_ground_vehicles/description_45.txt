Description of Crusader_AA_Mk_II: 
The Crusader III Anti-Aircraft Mark II is the second anti-air modification of the Crusader III, which is the third variant of the A15 Crusader cruiser tank family. It is armed with two 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft autocannons. The turret was a small polygonal turret with good armour but poor situational awareness for identifying approaching aircraft. As a result of Allied air superiority over the battlefields of north-west Europe, none of these Crusader Anti-Aircraft modifications saw considerable use against aircraft, however, a few were used against ground targets, most notably by the 1st Polish Armoured Division.
