Description of Centurion_Action_X: 
The Centurion Action X is a nickname of the official "Centurion Mantletless Turret" design. The Centurion Mantletless Turret was a project to create a new, heavily sloped turret design for the Centurion as a form of upgrade, taking inspiration from the Chieftain's turret design that also features no gun mantlet. The Centurion Mantletless Turret did not end up seeing widespread usage, with only one surviving example existing at the Bovington Tank Museum.
