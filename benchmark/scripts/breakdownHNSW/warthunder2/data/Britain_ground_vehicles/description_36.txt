Description of AEC_Mk_II: 
The AEC Armoured Cars were a series of vehicles developed during World War 2. After the British experience against Italian armoured cars in the Western Sahara, AEC decided to develop their own vehicle while the Daimler Armoured Car was still in development. A total of 629 units were built and entered service in 1941. Early versions tried to have the same firepower and armour as other British cruiser tanks but they failed. The Mk.II version used a larger turret for a three-man crew with a 6-pounder gun, redesigned front hull, and a 158 hp (118 kW) diesel engine.
