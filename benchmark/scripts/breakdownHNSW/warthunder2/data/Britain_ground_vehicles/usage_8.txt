Usage of Staghound_AA: 
The T17E2 main role is anti-aircraft. It is recommended to use tracer belts in order to be accurate yet deadly when engaging an enemy plane. It should be noted the T17E2 lacks capabilities to destroy enemy armour as most of tanks will be able to withstand your 12.7 mm machine guns. Do not engage with enemy armour unless they are lightly armoured (with armour less than 20 mm of thickness) or open vehicles (other anti-aircraft vehicles, Soviet SPGs, etc). Due to being a wheeled vehicle, the T17E2 has enough speed to capture enemy points and retreat. Use this tactic when there are no air engagements, go capture enemy points and avoid enemy contact unless you are in immediate danger or see an open vehicle, use your speed and low profile to your advantage. Bushes (both map props and tank decorators) are your friends in combat as they will camouflage you and reduce your tank silhouette. Be aware of your turret as, since it is open top, enemy planes will be able to kill your gunner in a strafe. Be aware that enemy tanks machine guns will be able to fire between the turret shield and kill your gunner (where the optics are at).
