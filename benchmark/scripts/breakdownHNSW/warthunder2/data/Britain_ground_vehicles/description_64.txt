Description of Skink: 
The Canadian Army requested a self-propelled anti-aircraft utilizing a 20 mm autocannon to help protect mobile units. Utilizing their local productions of M4 Shermans (known locally as "Grizzly"), work began to adapt the Grizzly to be equipped with 20 mm anti-aircraft guns in March 1943. A prototype design was ready by January 1944, and in February the design was designated as the Skink. However, later in the year, the Skink production was cancelled due to lack of orders from the Allied partners, leaving with only 3 prototype models produced. One Skink was sent to Great Britain for evaluation, eventually sent it to combat theater and saw limited use.
