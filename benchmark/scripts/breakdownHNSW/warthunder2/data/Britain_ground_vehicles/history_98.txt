History of Khalid: 
Before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Pahlavi Iran had already planned for upgrades on their armed forces equipment in view of the menacing Soviet forces in Central Asia and (subsequently, after the overthrown and execution of Hafizullah Amin in 1979) the bordering Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), the plans for new MBTs for the Iranian Army were also on schedule as early as 1971. As the FV4201 Chieftain series MBT were already obsolete by the late 1970s with the introduction of advanced Soviet MBTs (i.e. T-64), the British were also attempting to upgrade a new export tank based on the Chieftain with better power pack and subsystems. The new tank, known as the Shir-1 (Lion-1), was based on the Chieftain Mk.5 and started its development in 1974, receiving more than 700 orders. Featuring upgraded FCS, the new tanks, at over a thousand of them and planned to be manufactured in Royal Ordnance Leeds, were intended to be delivered by 1980.
