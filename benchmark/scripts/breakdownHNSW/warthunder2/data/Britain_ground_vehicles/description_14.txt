Description of Crusader_II: 
The Tank, Cruiser Mark VIA, Crusader II (A15) is the second variant of the A15 Crusader cruiser tank family. The Crusader light tanks were one of the major British cruiser tank families during World War II. Over 5,000 Crusader tanks of all variants were produced, and they contributed significantly to British triumphs in the North Africa campaign. The chassis of this light tank was modified in order to produce anti-aircraft, fire support, observation, communication, bulldozer, and recovery vehicle variants, although it would not see active action outside of Africa. The first Crusader I tanks entered service in 1941, and while manoeuvrable, they were severely lacking in armour and firepower. The Crusader II followed with thicker armour but the same armament as the Crusader I: a 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder tank gun.
