Description of Cromwell_V: 
The Tank, Cruiser, Mk VIII, Cromwell V (A27M) (or just Cromwell V) is a Rank II British medium tank 
with a battle rating of 3.0 (AB/SB) and 3.3 (RB). It was released along with the initial British ground tree in Update 1.55 "Royal Armour". An adequately armoured cruiser tank that is armed with a rather inadequate 75 mm cannon due to poor post-penetration performance. However, the Cromwell V's speed makes it a very good flag runner akin to the M18 Hellcat.
