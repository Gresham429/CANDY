Usage of Black_Prince: 
When engaged in combat with heavier and more lethal vehicles, using the APDS rounds will allow you to cause major damage. In order to get the most protection for the tank and crew, do not expose the sides or allow enemies to get to the rear of the vehicle. Instead, turn the front of tank towards the enemy player but give it a slight angle. The enemy rounds will have a higher chance of ricocheting off of the frontal plate, however if the enemy tank uses HE ammunition, there is a high chance that the round may bounce and enter the vehicle's roof.
