Description of Avenger: 
The A30 SP Avenger was a further development of the A30 Challenger, intended to resolve some of the design issues including the tall turret and limited mobility. No longer having the need for a fourth crewmember in the turret, the turret was able to be significantly shortened, and was also mounted on a lower superstructure. The turret was made open-top, but could be screened with armoured covers when necessary, providing the commander and loader with a full range of visibility. Additionally, return rollers were added to alleviate the track-throwing tendencies of the Challenger. However, by the time a prototype was completed, development of the vehicle had been deprioritised with the introduction of the 17-pdr-equipped M10 in favour of the Comet I, and it suffered in trials against the Archer and Alecto. The Avenger project was eventually dropped in 1950.
