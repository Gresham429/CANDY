History of Daimler_Mk_II: 
The excellent performance of the turretless Daimler Scout Car led people to suggest that a larger armoured car version with a turret be built as well. The Daimler was similar in design but also introduced a rear-facing wheel for the commander to use in an emergency. It carried the same turret as the Tetrarch light tank, putting it on a par with early-war British tanks.
