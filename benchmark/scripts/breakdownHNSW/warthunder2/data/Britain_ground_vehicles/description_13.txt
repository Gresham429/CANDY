Description of A13_Mk_II_1939: 
The Tank, Cruiser, Mark IV (A13 Mark II 1939) is the early-production second variant of the A13 cruiser tank family. It was the fourth cruiser tank family designed for the British Army, the direct successor of the A13 Mark I. The earliest A13 Mark IIs were A13 Mark Is with turret armour added. As a result, the hull protection of the A13 Mark II 1939 is identical to that of the A13 Mark I, with the exception of improved turret protection. Only 8 units were made in this fashion.
