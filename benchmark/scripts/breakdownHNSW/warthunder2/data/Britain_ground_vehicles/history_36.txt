History of AEC_Mk_II: 
The Associated Equipment Co. (AEC) Ltd. company, which made London's double-decker buses, put forth an unsolicited design for a heavy armoured car, based on their Matador MAT (medium artillery tractor). The army was disinclined at first, but Prime Minister Churchill intervened in AEC's favour. The Mark I model carried a 2-pounder in a Valentine tank turret. Some of these were sent for use in North Africa. The Mark II, which had increased horsepower and a new three-man turret with the 6-pounder, was only produced in small numbers. Approximately 24 were given to Yugoslavian partisans in late 1944.
