History of Sherman_IC_%22Trzyniec%22: 
Around 1943 in World War II, the M4 Sherman was one of the best tanks in use by the Allies. It superseded the German standard Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs at the time. However, it was during the middle of 1943 that the Sherman design was beginning to wane in superiority with the reveal of newer German tanks in the front lines, namely the Tiger I and the Panther tanks.[1] These tanks could not only take out the Sherman at a longer range than the Sherman can compete in, but also withstand the 75 mm rounds fired from the Sherman with their frontal armour. To improve the Sherman's firepower against these better German tanks, the Americans decided to up-gun their tanks with a better 76 mm gun. The British, however, chose to up the ante with one of the Allies' most potent anti-tank guns at the time, the 17-pounder.
