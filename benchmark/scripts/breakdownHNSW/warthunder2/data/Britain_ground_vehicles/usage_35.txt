Usage of Grant_I: 
Grant I has a similar playstyle to the M3 Lee and is a multi-turret tank, with a 75 mm gun with a limited field of view placed on the right side hull, and a 37 mm on a fully-traversable turret that can be used separately from the main gun. Compared to the other medium tanks that are equipped with a rotating turret, the Grant I just like M3 Lee has limited gun coverage making the use of 75 mm feel like one is playing a turretless tank destroyer like the StuG III A. But compared to the StuG, Grant I also has a rapid-firing 37 mm M5 cannon that can protect the Grant I from side and rear attacks to buy time for the Grant to turn around to use its deadlier 75 mm M2. It's a medium tank that can be used as both a medium tank and tank destroyer. When fielding the Grant I, one has to be somewhat careful when playing, listen to the surroundings and trying to point the front of the hull so the 75 mm cannon can shoot at the targets that will appear. Getting the transmission or the engine of the Grant I disabled will render it useless to bring its full firepower on the target if it can't turn the hull around to aim its 75 mm on targets. It might have a 37 mm with all around coverage, but the 37 mm will not be 100% efficient against most targets in its BR bracket but it's more useful against lower BR targets where it can penetrate most light targets with certainty.
