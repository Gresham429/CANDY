Description of Sherman_II: 
The Sherman II was identical to the M4A1 variant of the Sherman deployed by the U.S. Army ground forces, except it had access to the late-war armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) ammunition. The British acquired many more Shermans than any other Allied nation: 17,181 units (approximately 34% of all M4 Sherman medium tanks constructed). The British supported and supplied free Polish and Czechoslovak government-in-exile armoured units with M4A1, M4A2, and M4A4 variants.
