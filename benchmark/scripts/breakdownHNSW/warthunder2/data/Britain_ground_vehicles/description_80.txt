Description of Centurion_Mk.5_AVRE: 
The Centurion Mk.5 Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers was designed for clearing minefields using a Giant Viper towed mine-clearance system, destroying fortified positions with its 165 mm L9A1 demolition gun capable of firing 60 lb (29 kg) HESH rounds, and overall providing cover and safe working space for the engineers. The AVRE was also equipped with a dozer blade for clearing up debris. In preparation for Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Centurion AVREs were uparmoured and remained in service until replaced by the Chieftain AVRE and Trojan vehicles in service.
