Description of ZA-35: 
The ZA-35 was a variant of the Rooikat modified by the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (ARMSCOR) in the early 1990s to fit the SPAA role. It was equipped with dual 35 mm cannons produced by Lyttelton Engineering (now Denel Land Systems) derived from the Oerlikon 35 mm, and an EDR 110 search and tracking radar mounted on a mast that could be raised up to 5 metres to avoid low obstacles. Only a few prototypes were built before the project was eventually cancelled.
