Usage of Centurion_Mk.5/1: 
Take advantage of your good gun depression of -10Â° and powerful 20-pdr cannon to snipe from long distances. If you want to play close quarters, use cover as much as possible since your armour is something you shouldn't rely upon. The gun stabilizer means you can shoot faster than most tanks at that BR without needing to come to a stop. The night vision is a bonus and paired with the IR spotlight on the front side of the turret the vehicle can be excellent in night battles.
