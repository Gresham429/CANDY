Description of A13_Mk_I_(3rd_R.T.R.): 
During World War II, the British Army's 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (3rd R.T.R.) was equipped with the A13 Mark I. The 3rd R.T.R. was a British Army armoured regiment that existed from 1917 to 1992. It was a unit of the Royal Tank Regiment, which was itself a unit of the Royal Armoured Corps. In 1917, it was known as the C Battalion, Tank Corps. With the onset of World War II, the British army was once again deployed to France. 3rd R.T.R., commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Keller, was ready for deployment as part of the 1st Armoured Division in 1940 when it was abruptly redirected to Calais. It took part in the four-day Siege of Calais as part of the Battle of France. Unfortunately, all of its tanks were destroyed, and many of its soldiers were killed or captured; nevertheless, some of its forces retreated to Dunkirk or were evacuated from Calais before the port was overrun.
