Description of Hovet: 
The Hovet (חובט, lit. batsman) represent the M163 VADS in IDF service. According to the records of the IDF, the vehicle joined the Israeli Air Defense Command in 1975 as a new air defense weapon, alongside the MIM-72 Chaparral which was introduced a year earlier. The Hovet, however, waited 7 years until it earned its first victory against an enemy target, in the 1982 Lebanese War, and further served in the IDF for more than 2 decades until the IADC was disbanded, leading to the decommission of the Hovet and its modernized variant, Machbet, which was upgraded with TVD and 4 FIM-92 Stingers.
