History of Magach_7C: 
The Magach 7C, or "Battering-Ram 7 Gimel" as translated from Hebrew, is the third development of the Magach 7 series. The Magach 7 first entered service with the Israeli Defense Forces in the mid 1980s. It was a radical new design from previous Magachs, featuring an uparmored hull and turret. Rather than the addition of ERA which Israel had used on previous Magachs, the Magach 7 series was given composite screens on the turret, side-skirts, and hull. These upgrades resulted in the Magach 7 sharing few visual characteristics with the M60 Patton tank upon which it is based.
