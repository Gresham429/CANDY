History of Sho%27t_Kal_Gimel: 
After the earlier modification of Sho't (Centurion in Israel service) with NATO equipment by 1974, the Gimel (C) modification of Sho't Kal installed additional machine guns, new 10-shot smoke grenade launcher on its turret sides, as well as enhanced protection with a new welded armour plate on its UFP and new Blazer ERA packs on some areas of the tank.
