Description of ZSU-57-2_(Israel): 
During the Six-Day War of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Israel captured an unknown number of ZSU-57-2 SPAAs from Egypt and Syria. These anti-aircraft vehicles served with the IDF after being adopted into service. They received Israeli camouflage patterns, painting, numbers, and designation. While they paraded in the Israeli Independence Day, it's still debated to this day whether or not they were used in combat or even if they were deployed by the IDF at some point. The Israeli Armor Museum states that they were never deployed with the IDF.
