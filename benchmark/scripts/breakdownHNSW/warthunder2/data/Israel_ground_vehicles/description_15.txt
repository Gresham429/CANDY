Description of Magach_6A: 
The Magach 6A, also called Magach 6 Alef in some situations, was the earliest version of the Magach 6 family, which was just the name given by Israel to the American M60, M60A1 and M60A3 tanks. The Magach 6A was a modernized M60A1 with some modifications, including the low profile Urdan cupola and in some cases Blazer ERA. The tanks saw extensive use in combat in the Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War and against insurgent groups. All Magach 6As were eventually upgraded to the Magach 6B (6 Bet) standard.
