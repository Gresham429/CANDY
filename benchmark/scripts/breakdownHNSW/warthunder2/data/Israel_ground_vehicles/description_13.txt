Description of Magach_3: 
The Magach 3 was an overall upgrade to the M48 tanks fitted by Israel. Compared to the Magach 1 and 2, it was the first to receive major upgrades not fitted by Americans or Germans. It included a more powerful American-made 105 mm M68 cannon with more powerful anti-tank rounds to deal with Soviet threats like the T-54 and T-62. The tank also eventually received Blazer ERA to deal with Soviet made RPGs and ATGMs fitted in large quantities by Egyptian and Syrian forces. The tank also received a new 750 HP engine coupled with a new Allison transmission (the same used by the first M60s), as well as new radio equipment and electronics.
