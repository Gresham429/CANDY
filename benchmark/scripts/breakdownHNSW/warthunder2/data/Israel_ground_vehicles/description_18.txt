Description of Tiran_4S: 
During the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars, Israel was able to capture a number of Soviet-supplied T-54 tanks from opposing nations, which were slightly modified and redesignated as the Tiran 4. These were upgraded during the 1970s to equip the American 105 mm M68 cannon, shared by other Israeli tanks, becoming the Tiran 4S variant.
