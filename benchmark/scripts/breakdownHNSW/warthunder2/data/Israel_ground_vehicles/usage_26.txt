Usage of Magach_6C: 
In battle, the Magach 6C is best used as a flanker and/or a sniper. At range, the turret armour is usually effective against the kinetic rounds used at its BR and the vehicle's laser rangefinder let's you pick off targets at long range with your potent APFSDS. The Magach 6C can also be used as a brawler using its stabilizer and thermals to find the enemy first and deliver a clean shot. The vehicle is also well equipped to take down low-flying helicopters or aircraft with its machine guns although it's not recommended as this will expose your location to nearby tankers. Finally, this vehicle offers very good situational awareness as the laser warning system will warn you anytime a vehicle laser rangefinds or launches laser-guided ordnance at you, giving you enough time to get to cover and hide.
