Description of Gal_Batash: 
The Magach 6B Gal Batash was an upgrade present in a small number of Magach 6B Gal tanks, the idea of this upgrade was to increase firepower, protection and improve optics and electronics without affecting the mobility of the tank. The Magach 6B Gal Batash remained in low intensity service, since it was meant to complement the lack of Merkava tanks in rearguard and reserve units. The Magach 6B Gal Batash used the same fire control system as the Magach 6B Gal, that is, the "Gal" fire control system. To combat the added weight, a new engine was installed with 908hp. This model only saw limited production and was considered one of the most modern israeli tanks in service when it came out.
