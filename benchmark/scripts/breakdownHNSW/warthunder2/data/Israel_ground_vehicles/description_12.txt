Description of M-51_(W): 
The M-51 (W) had the same role as the normal M-51 and the only difference was the hull: instead of the M4A1 hull, it was built using the M4A3 and M4A4 chassis. Considered to be the most advanced version of the Sherman ever produced, the M-51 featured a 105 mm gun, an improved engine, a new turret, and access to a powerful HEAT shell. Developed based on the M-50, it was Israel's primary tank against Soviet-made T-55s and T-62s during the Yom Kippur War. In this conflict, neither the Centurions nor Patton tanks were capable of consistently penetrating the armour of the new Soviet designs, and while the M-51 was unreliable, slow, and had little to no protection, its armament was the most capable of all tanks in service with the IDF. Despite being obsolete, 180 were built, and had decent results during the Six Day War of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War, even against the most modern Soviet designs.
