Description of Magach_6B_Gal: 
The Magach 6B Gal was an important upgrade developed by Israel before the 1990s. Since it was obvious that the Merkava would not entirely replace the Magach in service it was deemed necessary an upgrade to older models like the Magach 6B and A that lacked any sort of modern military electronics and optics. As such, the "Gal" Fire Control System was created and then fitted into the Magach 6B and 6A models. It was not given to the C model since this used a more modern American fire control system. The Magach 6B Gal would later be upgraded to the Magach 6B Gal Batash with improvements to the protection and powerplant.
