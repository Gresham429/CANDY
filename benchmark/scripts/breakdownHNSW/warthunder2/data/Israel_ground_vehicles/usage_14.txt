Usage of Magach_6: 
When playing the Magach 6, try not to be at the frontlines of the battle too often and instead, stay a bit farther back, supporting your teammates that are on the frontline or provide flanking cover, where the enemy will least expect you to be. Make sure to move from cover to cover if possible, and hide behind hills to reduce the likelihood of being shot at. The Magach 6 is quite a tall tank and can be easily spotted moving across terrain. Equipped with the 105 mm M68 cannon, the Magach 6 can damage any tank. Usually your main shell will be APDS, as it offers the best overall performance, though HEATFS does offer more penetration but has its own set of disadvantages.
