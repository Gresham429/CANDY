History of AMX-13_(Israel): 
The AMX-13 was employed by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War against Egyptian and Syrian forces. It was Israel's only choice to acquire a modern tank in a period when France was the only global power willing to sell weapons to Israel. Israel first acquired a batch of 180 units of the AMX-13 light tank from France in 1956. This was part of an agreement to increase the strength of the Israeli army, and to maintain in the region after arms purchase agreements between Egypt and Czechoslovakia.
