Description of AMX-13_(Israel): 
The AMX-13 was employed by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967. A total of 400 tanks were acquired from France between 1956 and 1967 with three battalions being formed and ready to be deployed. The AMX-13 was used in an unconventional way, since the IDF lacked proper modern MBTs due to the arms embargoes imposed over them, it was decided to use the AMX-13 in frontline duties and not in the usual roles of light tanks, like reconnaissance. Thus, the AMX-13 sustained heavy casualties during the war, and was promptly retired after the war.
