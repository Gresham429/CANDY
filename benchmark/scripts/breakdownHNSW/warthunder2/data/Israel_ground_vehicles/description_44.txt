Description of Merkava_Mk.4M: 
The Merkava Mk.4M is the third and last subvariant of the Merkava Mk.4, which is the fourth variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. It is an enhanced subvariant of the standard Merkava Mk.4, outfitted with the Trophy active protection system (APS). Also known as the Merkava Mk.4M Windbreaker, this tank began production in 2009. In 2011, the first brigade outfitted with these tanks was declared operational. It saw action in the same year and successfully resisted an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) attack. Since then, the updated Merkava Mk.4M tanks equipped with the Trophy APS have intercepted dozens of rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) such as the RPG-29 and ATGMs such as the Kornet and Metis-M.
