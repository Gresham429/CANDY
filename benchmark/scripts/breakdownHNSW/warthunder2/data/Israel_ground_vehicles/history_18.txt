History of Tiran_4S: 
The Tiran 4S is an upgrade to the captured T-54s in Israeli service. The "S" in the Tiran 4S stands for "Sharir", which was the name of the 105 mm M68 gun in Israeli service. Aside from storage and logistical modifications to the vehicle, the M68's loading system was also redesigned in part due to the T-54's loader being seated on the right of the gun and the M68 being designed to be loaded from the left. Another modification added to the Tiran 4S was the replacement of the hydraulic gun drive with an electrical gun drive similar to the Sho't tanks in service. The hydraulic gun drive was deemed too dangerous by the IDF as penetration of the gun drive caused hydraulic lines to snap and release hydraulic gases inside the crew compartment that would inflict burns and incapacitate the crew, a lesson learned from the Magachs in the Yom Kippur War. The electrical traverse caused the turret to be more cramped and the turret rotation was made slower but was generally safer.
