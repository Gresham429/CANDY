Description of Sho%27t_Kal_Alef: 
Israel employed the Centurion (named Sho't) since its early days. It was one of their first main battle tanks alongside the American M48 Patton (named Magach). Just like with the Magach, the Sho't received a more capable firepower upgrade with the Sho't Kal Alef. This upgrade included the introduction of the American M68 105 mm cannon, and a new powerplant in the form of the Continental AVDS-1790-2A diesel engine and Allison CD-850-6A transmission that were also used by the Magach 3. The new cannon forced the Sho't to lose its stabilizer, but with access to APDS, HEAT, and HESH shells, it was much more capable of dealing with Soviet T-54/55s and T-62s as well as entrenched infantry.
