History of Magach_1: 
In February 1951, the US Army opted for a new design to replace their M46/M47 tanks. Designated the 90 mm Gun Tank T-48, it featured a novel (for American Cold War tanks) hemispherical turret, hull, and suspension design. The crew was reduced to four, and it began production in 1952 after being named for the famous General George S. Patton. During initial production, several protection defects were identified and a program to refit them began, resulting in the M48A1 with a slightly different driver's hatch and commander's cupola, now equipped with a .50 M2HB.
