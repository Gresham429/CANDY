Description of Merkava_Mk.1B: 
The Merkava Mk.1B was the first and only subvariant of Merkava Mk.1, which was the first variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. The IDF formerly had to rely on importing foreign weapons to maintain its armoured units since its industry was inadequate to develop domestic vehicles. The British deciding not to sell the Chieftain to the Israelis (because they were already supplying them to Arab countries) led to Israel to begin their own tank development program. Israel first deployed the Merkava Mk.1 during the Lebanon War in 1982; following the battle, numerous modifications were made and implemented. The Merkava Mk.1B and Merkava Mk.1 are essentially distinguished by the addition of a new firing control system, additional side armour for the suspension, and chains with balls on the back of the turret. Under the back of the turret bustle, there was a shot trap where a well-placed shot might totally jam the turret. Chain netting was added to pre-maturely detonate rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) before they hit the main armour, increasing survivability. In 1983, manufacturing was stopped in favour of the upgraded Merkava Mk.2 variant.
