Description of Tiran_4: 
The Tiran 4 (רודן; lit. Tyrant) was a captured and slightly-modified Arabic T-54 in Israeli service. The IDF was well-known for receiving different types of tank both from military sales and capture of enemy vehicles; after Soviet Union supplied an abundance of T-54/55/62 series medium tanks to Arabic countries neighbouring Israel (i.e. Egypt, Syria, Lebanon) since the 1960s, Israel had the chance to capture hundreds of vehicles during the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, replenishing the heavy losses of the Israeli armoured corps, as well as using them to disguise as Arabic armoured corps to hit them unexpectedly. These captured Soviet-built tanks were named Tiran and the different numbers represented different types of tanks; in this case, Tiran 4 was the designation of modified T-54 with logistical modifications.
