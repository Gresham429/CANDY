Usage of Sho%27t_Kal_Gimel: 
Players of the previous Sho't Kal Alef will quickly find themselves at home since the overall handling of Gimel is very similar, if not identical to the aforementioned. Gimel has an extra layer of armour on its UFP as well as Blazer ERA on some areas of the tank; while this can help it survive full-calibre and HEAT shells, it will not survive any late Cold War-era missiles or most APFSDS. The cramped interior also means any penetrating shots will cause extensive damage to the crew and compartment. Thus, it is best to stay away from heated battlefields and never rush in Sho't Kal Gimel (its inferior speed also helps to limit this).
