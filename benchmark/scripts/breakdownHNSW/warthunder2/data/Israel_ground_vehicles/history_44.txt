History of Merkava_Mk.4M: 
Due to the relatively small size of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) compared to some of its potential opponents, Israel's military doctrine is ever focused on protecting its highly-trained personnel from harm during combat. This is typically achieved by fielding advanced technology designed to reduce casualties. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in the design of the Merkava tank. Beyond its rare configuration, which places the engine at the front to soak up penetrating rounds, as well as the "Hairs of Shulamit" passive protective chains around the rear of the tank's turret, in the early 2000s Israel began simultaneous development of two Active Protection Systems (APS) designed to intercept and destroy incoming anti-tank weaponry.
