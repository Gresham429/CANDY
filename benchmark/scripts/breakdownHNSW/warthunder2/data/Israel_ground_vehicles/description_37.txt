Description of Merkava_Mk.2D: 
The Merkava Mk.2D was the third and last subvariant of the Merkava Mk.2, which was the second variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. Several enhancements were made to the Merkava Mk.2 over its service life. The Merkava Mk.2B was equipped with gunner thermal imaging equipment; this was followed by more armour and composite screens on the top of the turret of the Merkava Mk.2C, to enhance urban warfare protection against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) fired from building rooftops, as well as attacks from enemy air forces. Finally, the Merkava Mk.2D was equipped with the most recent add-on modular composite armour, quite similar to that of the Merkava Mk.4 variant, where damaged modular composite armour may be easily swapped out for new modular composite armour even while in combat. Newly upgraded modular composite armour could also be simply added without requiring significant changes to the tank's fundamental structure.
