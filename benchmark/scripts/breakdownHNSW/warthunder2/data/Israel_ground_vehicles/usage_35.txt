Usage of Sho%27t_Kal_Dalet: 
As mentioned in previous sections, the Sho't Kal Dalet is rather poorly protected against straight-on kinetic hits, but its cannon is quite lethal with the available ammunition and rate of fire. As such, the Sho't Kal Dalet should be used moreso as a "sniper", staying farther range and using the Sharir cannon and the M111 APFSDS round to engage enemies from afar.
