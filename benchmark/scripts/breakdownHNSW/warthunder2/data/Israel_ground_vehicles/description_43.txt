Description of Merkava_Mk.4_LIC: 
The Merkava Mk.4 LIC is the second subvariant of the Merkava Mk.4, which is the fourth variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. The Merkava Mk.4 LIC is extremely similar to the Merkava Mk.4B, with the exception of some minor changes designed for low-intensity conflict (LIC). To prevent explosive charges from being installed in vulnerable parts of the tank, the optics, exhaust ports, and ventilators are all covered by a newly designed high-strength metal mesh. To assist navigation and manoeuvrability in an urban context, rubber whip pole markers with LED tips and a driver-facing rear-facing camera were also installed.
