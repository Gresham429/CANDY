Usage of Gal_Batash: 
The Magach 6B Gal Batash is rather unique compared to other M60 variants, in the sense that it is one of the few versions to have composite armour protecting any part of the tank. With this said, it's still an M60, so brawling will not be especially effective, as most enemies will penetrate your armour without issue. The best "safe" use of the Gal Batash will be to utilize the good gunner sight to snipe enemies at range. The M426 round has very respectable stats for this BR, and since it's an M60, your height will make it slightly easier to look over hills and terrain. Alternatively, one can flank the enemy, taking enemy light vehicles by surprise and protecting your teammates from enemy flanking manoeuvres, whilst simultaneously holding the ability to attack enemy MBTs from the side. This tactic is generally reliable on maps with lots of foliage on the flanks, especially in up-tiers, where the effectiveness of your APFSDS round will be immensely diminished by the improved armour of your foes.
