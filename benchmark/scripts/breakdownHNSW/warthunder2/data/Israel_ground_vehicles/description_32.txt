Description of ZSU-23-4_(Israel): 
Israel captured a total of 60 ZSU-23-4 from Egypt and Syria, who acquired them from the Soviet Union shortly after its introduction, during the Yom Kippur War and other conflicts. While there is very limited data surrounding Israel's usage of ZSU-23-4s in combat or even in active service, some captured units were used for personal training in a very limited number. Currently there is a ZSU-23-4 in display at the Yad la-Shiryon Museum, Israel.
