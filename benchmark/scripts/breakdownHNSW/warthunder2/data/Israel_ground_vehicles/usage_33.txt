Usage of Machbet: 
By the time of Machbet's upgrade was done on IADC's fleet of Hovet in late-1990s, the world has already been evolved to the 4th generation jets with more than enough ordnances to take out Machbet at long distance; but if used cautiously against earlier jets with inferior electronics and aim for careless targets, Machbet could still serve the team well with its obsolete chassis.
