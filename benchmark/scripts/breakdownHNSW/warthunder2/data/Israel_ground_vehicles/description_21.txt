Description of Magach_3_(ERA): 
During its service with Israel, the M48 Patton was heavily modified and upgraded to the point that it was much superior to the base version. The Magach 3 was the first big upgrade plan for the M48, including the introduction of the American M68 105 mm gun, with access to APFSDS. This upgrade was deemed necessary after mediocre results during the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. Eventually, the Magach 3 received Blazer ERA to deal with RPGs and ATGMs that were starting to be fielded in large numbers by Egyptian and Syrian forces. The tank was meant to be a match to the Soviet-made T-54/55 and T-62. The tank also received improvements to the mobility, with the engine of the M60, a new transmission, and a low-profile commander's cupola.
