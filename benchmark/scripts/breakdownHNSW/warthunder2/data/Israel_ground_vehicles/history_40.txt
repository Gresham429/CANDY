History of Imp.Chaparral_(Israel): 
The United States Army developed the M48 Chaparral in the 1960s as a short-range surface-to-air missile system which would complement the M163 Vulcan. The system used the MIM-72 Chaparral missile - a unique adaptation of the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile which had been entering service in the US Air Force at the time. The Chaparral launch vehicle carried four such missiles on a rotating turret on top of an M113 hull, with an enlarged "cabin" at the front containing the fire control system. The unique turret was designed for fast 360-degree rotation as well as a maximum elevation of 90 degrees, allowing the system to engage enemy aircraft quickly and easily.
