Description of Magach_6M: 
The Magach 6M was part of the Israeli fleet of M60 tanks acquired from the United states that served alongside Centurion MBTs and other light tanks. This specific variant of the vehicle was the latest variant developed by Israel for the M60A3, it was identical to the Magach 6R but has a new Nachal Oz fire control system fitted. Other than that, the vehicle remained very similar to others in Israeli service with Blazer ERA blocks, but the tank was not very liked by the crew members since the reliability was relatively poor. With the introduction of more capable Magach tanks like the Magach 7, the Magach 6M quickly became obsolete and no further modifications were installed.
