Usage of Sho%27t: 
Like other Centurions, thanks to the underpowered engine, Sho't is not a fast tank by any means and its 35 km/h top speed makes it lag behind some tanks at its rank, not to mention fast movers like Leopard 1. However, this also means that the Sho't can stay close with friendly heavy tanks (which are still common at the battle rating) and provide reliable fire support for them even on the move thanks to its gun stabilizer. Although the overall protection is not sufficient to withstand shots from enemies, the gun depression angle certainly helps to find hull-down positions and use the gun mantlet to absorb or bounce incoming shells. While some players prefer the high penetration of APDS, some might opt to use the stock APCBC for better spalling; but in most cases where the enemy has thick armour, APDS will be the go-to shell for Sho't.
