Description of Machbet: 
The Machbet (מחבט; lit. Racquet) was an upgrade of the fleet of Hovets (M163 VADS) in service with the Israel Air Defense Command in the late 1990s to modernize the vehicle. The upgrade featured 4 all-aspect infrared-tracking Stinger missiles that allow it to engage long-range targets, and an IRST tracker that was more reliable than the AN/VPS-2 and also doesn't trigger aircraft RWR. These vehicles replaced the Hovet in service by 1998, and were deployed along the Purple Line (post-Six-Day War ceasefire line between Israel/Syria, de facto border line) until the Israel Air Defense Command was disbanded in 2006.
