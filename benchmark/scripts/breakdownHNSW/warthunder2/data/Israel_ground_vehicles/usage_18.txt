Usage of Tiran_4S: 
The Tiran 4S combines the mobility and armour of the T-54 series of tanks in the USSR tree and the 105 mm M68 in the US tree. However, it comes with a caveat, the Tiran 4 and Tiran 4S have a significantly slower turret traverse at 5.9Â°/s. This limitation is somewhat exacerbated by the lack of stabilization on the Tiran 4 and 4S as the gun can be moved much faster by moving the hull in the same direction the gun is traversing. Most of its peers at its BR range have stabilizers which puts the Tiran 4S at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the front ammunition rack is only covered by a small fuel tank in the side and front. Any piercing shot from a high penetration shell or anti-tank guided missile that passes through the fuel tanks will guarantee an ammunition explosion. Unfortunately, the front ammunition rack is the first stage ammo rack thus it is impossible to leave it empty.
