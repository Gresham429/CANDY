Description of M-51: 
The M-51 was a further development of the M-50 Super Sherman. After the establishment of the Israeli State in 1948, the IAF faced a lot of conflicts with different nations, and thus it needed a cheap way to create a capable armoured force. The M-50 was developed, using the M4A4 and M4A1 chassis and a 76 mm cannon, however this was deemed very weak against more modern tanks like the T-54/55 that appeared in the following years. Thus, the M-51 was developed, using a 105 mm rifled cannon (the same used by the AMX-30). The tank saw conflict during the Yom Kippur War alongside Centurions and Patton tanks, in fact, the M-51 with its HEAT shell was the more capable tank to face the T-55 and T-62s armour, however the tank suffered from poor engine reliability, mediocre off-road mobility, and little to no protection against enemy tanks, ATGMs, or RPGs. Eventually the tanks were sold to Chile, where they were known as M-60.
