Description of Zachlam_Tager: 
During the IDF arming process during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the IDF employed several American half-tracks as their main APCs. Vehicles like the M2, M3, M5, and M9 were acquired from different sources. Many were adapted for different purposes, like the TCM-20 SPAA. With the introduction of the French SS.11 ATGM in the 1950s (locally designated "Tager"), it was decided to use the abundant American half-tracks for anti-armour purposes. Even though they were somewhat obsolete by then, they saw most of their action during the Six-Day War of 1967 against T-54s. However due to a lack of doctrinal knowledge in of ATGM usage, many Tagers were ignored during the conflict, and it is not clear if any scored kills.
