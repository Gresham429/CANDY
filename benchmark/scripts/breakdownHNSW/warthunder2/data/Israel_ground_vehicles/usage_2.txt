Usage of Magach_1: 
The Magach 1 will feel familiar to tankers from the American and German tank trees, as it is essentially a copy-paste M48A1/M48A2 C from those trees. Being the first true MBT that the Israelis have access to (alongside the Sho't) it will bring a new playstyle to those who have been using the M-51s and French light tanks before it.
