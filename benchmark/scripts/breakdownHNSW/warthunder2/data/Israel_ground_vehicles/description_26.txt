Description of Magach_6C: 
As Israel upgraded its relatively old fleet of M60 tanks, one of its many upgrades was the Magach 6C based on the M60A3, one of the latest variants of the M60 family. While previous versions of these tanks included Blazer ERA packages and relatively old fire control systems, the Magach 6C incorporated thermal imaging for the gunner as well as an improved engine similar to that used in the latest Sho't tanks. The tank used the Gal Batash fire control system, which employed first generation thermals. The tank also received minor modifications like more smoke launchers and a laser warning receiver that notified the tank crew members if an enemy was pointing at them with a laser, be that a laser range-finder or a laser-guided anti-tank missile.
