Usage of Merkava_Mk.2D: 
Aside from the additional composite screens on the hull and turret, the Merkava Mk.2D does not differ so greatly compared to the Merkava Mk.2B. The Merkava Mk.2D continues to carry its quirk of possesses a front engine module. This should be taken into consideration when using the Merkava Mk.2D because most hits to the front will inevitably damage the engine and/or cause a fire, which will immobilize the tank. An immobilized tank is open to follow-up shots and so a Merkava that survives the first shot and gets stuck is still open to follow-up shots that will destroy it. Deploying smoke after a damaging hit from the front should be a survival instinct when playing this tank to provide that much extra cover and time needed to repair the tank's mobility to reverse away to cover.
