Description of Imp.Chaparral_(Israel): 
Israel acquired 52 units of the Chaparral system, that was very familiar to them since they already used the M113 APC and different configurations of its chassis, as well as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, in large numbers. It was used as a close-range air defence platform for many years, in many different variants, being upgraded at the end to the MIM-72G model that used a smokeless all aspect seeker and IRCCM (Infrared Counter Countermeasures). Israel was able to intercept 2 aircraft with this system, a MiG-17 in the Golan Heights in 1973 and another in the Lebanese Invasion of 1982, both operated by the Syrian Air Force.
