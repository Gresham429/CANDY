Description of Magach_2: 
The Magachs were a family of tanks that derived from the M48 and M60 Patton with different upgrades to the original models. Magach 2 was the Israeli service name for the American M48A2C. These tanks were used primarily during the Six-Day War against the Egyptian and Syrian forces (which mainly operated the T-54/55). The tanks proved successful in combat, being far superior to the M-51 Super Shermans used by Israel. However, the 105 mm gun from those tanks was deemed more reliable against the Soviet T-62, which was a response to the American M60.
