History of Tiran_4: 
As part of the Cold War and long-lasting Jewish-Arab conflicts, the Soviet Union sold many T-54 and T-55 to Syria and Egypt as part of their military sales. While the reliability of these tanks was proven throughout the conflicts, during the 1967 Six-Day War and the sequential Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel captured at least 300 T-54/55/62 series tanks during these two wars to resupply their heavily devastated armoured corps, dubbed "Tiran" (lit. "Tyrant") in Israeli service. Captured tanks were dubbed Tiran 1/2/3 for T-54/55/62 respectively, while Tirans which received some logistic modification were designated Tiran 4/5/6 instead. Israel used some of these tanks with their original Egyptian markings to cause harassment behind enemy lines along the Suez Canal.[1]
