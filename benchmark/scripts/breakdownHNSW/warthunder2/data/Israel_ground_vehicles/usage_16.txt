Usage of Magach_5: 
The Magach 5 is a fairly manoeuvrable MBT but its larger profile makes it easy to spot. The 105 mm Sharir cannon does well at long range shooting, as many tanks in the same BR can be destroyed with a single hit. The Magach 5 fares well in an urban setting with a fairly quick turret traverse and powerful ammo, however it is not the fastest and should have teammates nearby to cover the flanks. The front ammo stowage is the biggest detriment to the tanks survival in a frontal hit, so the ammo count should kept as low as possible. Overall, this tank is just right for most environments with it being most vulnerable to comparable ammo from other Western nations.
