Usage of TCM-20: 
For players who have played the M13 MGMC in the US tech tree, it can be said that the TCM-20 is an successor to M13 to some extent, especially with its iconic twin gun configuration. However, when enemy aircraft get too close, they will find out the major difference: they would soon be shattered by the 20 mm HS.404 autocannons, recalling the memories from being chased by aircraft with these cannons. Such an "upgrade" is very welcomed as the 20 mm calibre is still more than enough to take out strafing fighters with ease, with overall 720 rounds onboard at 120 rounds per load, if players get used to the relatively straight ballistics and not being trigger-happy, the overall efficiency could be on-par with other SPAAs in other tech trees with their respective advantages. Most of all, the M3 chassis ensures that the TCM-20 can get to where it is needed as soon as possible thanks to its 72 km/h top speed, making it a viable option to flank enemies in some occasions; while the 13 km/h reverse speed could still make sure it can retreat to cover if masses of enemies/menacing aircraft rushing to where the vehicle is. As said, TCM-20 is still a half-track based SPAAG with minimal protection; in fact rifle-calibre firearms can harm the crew at around 200 m from the sides, let along HMGs and autocannons at even higher penetration, so be extra careful on where players should appear - rushing or running into a heated frontline is certainly a death sentence to the TCM-20. Overall, the TCM-20 is still a good AA half-track to handle different types of vehicles, whether it's on wheels, tracks or flying ones.
