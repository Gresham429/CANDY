Description of Rochev: 
The Rochev was the name given by the IDF to the M109 self-propelled howitzer gun. They received the M109 before the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and the nickname  was associated with the variants from M109 to M109A2. Most of differences between all of these variants were internal and especially regarding the shell loading system. While the early M109 was used during the Yom Kippur War and Lebanon War of 1982, by the 2006 Lebanon War, only the longer barrel M109s with the new M185 cannon were still in service, with some field modifications to improve quality of life and or survivability of the crew, like extra machine guns or outside storage compartments.
