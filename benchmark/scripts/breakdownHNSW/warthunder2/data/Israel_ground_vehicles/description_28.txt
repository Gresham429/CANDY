Description of Magach_7C: 
The Magach 7C was the third development of the Magach 7 series. The Magach 7 came out in the 1980s with the C variant being developed in the 1990s. Unlike the Magach 7A, the Magach 7C employed passive arrays of armour instead of ERA kits like the ones present in the Magach 7A. With this extra armour, the Magach 7C took a hit to its mobility and received a new powerplant and transmission, the 900HP AVDS-1790-5A used in early Merkavas, and the transmission was upgraded to the same automatic transmission present in the Merkava Mk.2. The Magach 7C was eventually faced out in favour of the Merkava Mk.4 but it was still retained by reserve units of the IAF.
