Description of Sho%27t_Kal_Dalet: 
After devastating losses in the Yom Kippur War, the IDF realized the importance of crew protection in their tanks. Thus, the Sho't tanks and Magach tanks were fitted with Blazer ERA, a new type of protection designed to stop or decrease the penetration power of chemical weapons, like RPGs and ATGMs. The Sho't Kal Dalet (as it was called with the upgrades installed) also fitted new fire control system and gun, to improve lethality and firepower. The Kal Dalet was the last mass produced upgrade of the Centurion by Israel, and proved its effectiveness in the 1982 Invasion of Lebanon.
