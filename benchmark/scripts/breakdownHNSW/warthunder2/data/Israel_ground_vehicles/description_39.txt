Description of Merkava_Mk.3C: 
The Merkava Mk.3C is the second subvariant of the Merkava Mk.3, which is the third variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. The Merkava Mk.3C received the new Barak Zoher fire control system, which can be distinguished by the inclusion of a commander-independent sight on the turret roof, beginning in 1995. This adds hunter-killer capabilities to the Merkava Mk.3C, a trait that is desperately needed in modern conflict. The new fire control system can now automatically track targets and even low-flying helicopters. Other small upgrades, such as the insertion of composite screens into portions of the hull, were also implemented, mostly to defend the tank from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) launched from elevated positions.
