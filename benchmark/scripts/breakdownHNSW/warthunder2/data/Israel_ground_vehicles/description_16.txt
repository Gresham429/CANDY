Description of Magach_5: 
The Magach 5 was, at its core, an upgraded American M48A5. The Magach 5 was introduced in Israel after the Yom Kippur War of 1973. After this war, the IDF had to replace several examples of their Magach and Sho't tanks that were lost, especially due to anti-tank weapons like the RPG-2, RPG-7, and Malyutka ATGMs. To address this issue, the IDF adopted the American M48A5 and designated it Magach 5. This version of the tank was also an upgrade of the M48A3, incorporating the 105 mm rifled gun over the 90 mm gun in earlier M48 models. This upgrade was based in part in Israeli experiences with Magach tanks in 1967 and 1973.
