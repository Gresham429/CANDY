History of Merkava_Mk.4_LIC: 
The Merkava Mk.4 LIC (Low-Intensity Conflict) is a modern main battle tank used by the Israeli Defense Forces. It was developed as an upgrade to the Merkava Mk.4 tank, which entered service in the early 2000s. The Merkava Mk.4 LIC was specifically designed to meet the needs of the IDF in urban warfare and low-intensity conflicts. The tank was developed in response to the changing nature of warfare, which increasingly involved conflicts in urban environments, where traditional main battle tanks were less effective. Modifications included the addition of wire meshes around particularly sensitive areas of the tank such as air intakes and optics, to protect against planting of explosive charges.
