History of Machbet: 
As the world entered the last decade of the 20th Century, the Hovet had already become obsolete against new aerial threats due to its inferior FCS and lack of missiles. Thus, IAI planned for an upgrade to the fleet of Hovets with modernized FLIR tracking systems and FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS; this upgrade also introduced GPS and the "Hermit" (הרמיט) computerized command system for battery vehicles with all-in-one display of radar signals and video display from command systems via a military-grade briefcase laptop.
