Description of Merkava_Mk.4B: 
The Merkava Mk.4B is the first subvariant of the Merkava Mk.4, which is the fourth variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. Merkava Mk.4 development began in 1999, and production began in 2004. The development of this variant was reported in October 1999 through the issue of the military newspaper Bamachaneh ("At the Camp"). The Merkava Mk.3 was, nonetheless, still in production until 2003. The Merkava Mk.4 features removable modular composite armour, which has been employed on all sides, including the top, with a V-shaped belly armour pack for the underbelly. This modular system is intended to allow damaged tanks to be repaired quickly and returned to action. Due to the thinner rear armour, chains with iron balls are attached to interfere with projectiles before they contact the main armoured hull. The Merkava Mk.4B is a subvariant that has improved sensors and virtual reality vision capabilities, allowing crews to see the whole battlefield while remaining inside the tank. Furthermore, it is the world's first tank with a smart mission computer that supervises the tank's tasks. This superior artificial intelligence technology minimizes the workload of the crew, particularly the tank commander. It also aids in target identification and accuracy. This system is linked to a battle management system.
