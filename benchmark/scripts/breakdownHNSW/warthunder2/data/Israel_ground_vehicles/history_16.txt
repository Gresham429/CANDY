History of Magach_5: 
The Magach 5 was introduced after the Yom Kippur War of 1973. During this war, the IDF suffered heavy losses to Egyptian and Syrian anti tank weapons like the RPG-2, RPG-7 and Malyutka ATGMs. The Magach 5 was a way to address this lack of tanks in the IDF with more modern units, specifically the M48A5. This variant was at its core an upgraded M48A3 and incorporated several lessons from the Israeli experience with Magach tanks in 1967 and 1973.
