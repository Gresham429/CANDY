Description of Magach_6B: 
The Magach 6B (Bet) was an Israeli upgraded M60A1 tank, equipped with an AVDS-1790-2C RISE (Reliability Improved Selected Equipment) engine instead of the AVDS-1790-2A. The tank itself also received a thermoinsulating coating for the barrel and tracks from the Merkava Mk.1 MBT. An Urdan low profile commander cupola was also installed, preventing the installation of the 12.7 mm machine gun previously used in the original one. The Magach 6B instead featured an additional 12.7 mm M2HB machine gun above the barrel and a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-40 machine in front of the commander's cupola.
