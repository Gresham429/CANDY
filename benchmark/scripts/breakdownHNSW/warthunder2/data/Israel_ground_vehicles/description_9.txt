Description of M109_(Israel): 
Israel first acquired the ÔÅôM109 at the end of the 1960s, and later fielded more modern versions of the M109 like the M109A1 and M109A2. The first combat seen by the vehicle was during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and while Israeli doctrine did not incentivise a predominant role for its artillery, the precision mobility of the M109 proved its effectiveness in striking enemy strategic points. In a similar way, the M109 was used during the 1982 Lebanon War. By the 2006 Lebanon War, the early M109s were all replaced with its longer range versions.
