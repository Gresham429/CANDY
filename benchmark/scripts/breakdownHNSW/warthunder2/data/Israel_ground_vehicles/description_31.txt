Description of Merkava_Mk.2B: 
The Merkava Mk.2B is the first subvariant of the Merkava Mk.2, which is the second variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. In comparison to its predecessor, the Merkava Mk.1B, the Merkava Mk.2 variant has enhanced armour protection, a new transmission, and more fuel capacity. Chains with metal balls were added to the Merkava Mk.2's turret rear to provide additional protection against rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The tank comes standard with NBC protection and automatic fire extinguishing equipment. Compared to the standard Merkava Mk.2, the Merkava Mk.2B also included thermal imaging equipment for the gunner and minor changes to the fire-control system. The Merkava Mk.2 was first manufactured in 1983, and it was last produced in 1989, with 580 units constructed in total. It saw service in several local battles, where it performed well. The final Merkava Mk.2 tank was moved to reserve units in 2016. Most of the remaining tanks are currently in storage, though these might potentially be modified to become armoured personnel carriers. They were never exported.
