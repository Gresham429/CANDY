History of M-51: 
The M-51 was developed from an M-50 tank, whose project started in 1954 after Israel bought several AMX-13 tanks from France, although their armour protection was deemed inadequate. Israel purchased a number of the 75 mm guns in order to fit them onto M4 Sherman hulls as they constituted the backbone of the IDF tank force at that time. In 1955, a prototype turret was sent from France to Israel and Israeli Ordnance Corps military facilities began to up-gun the Sherman tanks with the French guns. The first 50 M-50 tanks were based on an M4A4 hull with a Continental R-975 gasoline engine and VVSS suspension. However, increased weight and narrow tracks of the tank, led to poor offroad mobility, so the rest of the M-50 were using M4A1 hulls with HVSS suspension and a Cummins VT-8-460 diesel engine instead. In total, about 300 M-50 Shermans were built by 1964.
