Description of AML-90_(Israel): 
The AML-90 was developed by the French company Panhard in the late 1950s, as a response to a commission by the French Ministry of Defense. It was based on the earlier AML-60, which mounted a 60 mm mortar as its main weapon. The AML-90 replaced the mortar with a DEFA low-pressure 90 mm rifled gun capable of firing high-explosive and high-explosive anti-tank shells. The AML-90 was used by several countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, but one of its most notable users was Israel. Israel acquired about 23 AML-90s from France in the early 1960s, and used them extensively in the Six-Day War of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973, amongst others.
