Usage of AMX-13_(Israel): 
How the AMX-13 can be used largely depends on what BR and nations it is facing. At a full down-tier, against 5.3/5.7 (AB/RB), the AMX-13 can be used at medium to long range as a travelling sniper. The main threats at that BR are heavies such as the American T34, the German Tiger II (H) and the Russian IS-2 (1944). These can all be penetrated in their respective weak spots at 500 m, however the further you are, the narrower the weak spots get, and there is no guarantee to disable them in a single shot.
