Usage of Tiran_4: 
For players who have played the T-54 series in other trees (Soviet, Chinese, Finnish), the Tiran 4 is yet another T-54 Model 1951, but this time in the Israeli tech tree as their captured tanks from Arabic countries. Aside from the Chinese Type 59 which is in fact T-54A, the remaining two are identical to the Tiran 4. Thanks to its revolutionary design back in the 1950s and devastating firepower upon penetrating enemy armour, the Tiran 4 can still serve as a spearhead for Israeli players alongside the US-originated Magachs (M48 Patton, M60 series).
