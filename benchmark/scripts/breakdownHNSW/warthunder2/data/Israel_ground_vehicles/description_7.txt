Description of TCM-20: 
The TCM-20 was an Israeli modification of the M3 half-track with a TCM-20 turret. This was likely a field modification done by Israel during their early days with sparse military equipment, mounting TCM-20 turrets on decade-old vehicles, including captured 6x6 trucks, BTR-152, and M3 half-tracks. The TCM-20 turret itself was an upgraded M55 Quadmount turret (M45 turret on M20 trailer) with two Hispano Hs.404 20 mm autocannons for better firepower. The lack of documents on the introduction of these modified vehicles makes it hard to trace their history, but they were likely replaced by the more advanced M163 VADS (Hovet) with radar rangefinder by 1975.
