Description of Sho%27t_Kal_Gimel: 
During its lifetime, Israel employed a large fleet of Centurion tanks that were modified to fit modern NATO equipment such as improved weaponry engine and armour. These vehicles were called Sho't and this specific variant included the more powerful 105 mm Sharir cannon that was very similar to the already in use 105 mm M68 cannon. Compared to previous variants, the most notable upgrade was the introduction of Blazer ERA, the engine and transmission remained the same but the improved armour meant that the vehicle was much more capable of dealing with Soviet threats like RPG's and other tandem-shaped warheads. The vehicle was also further modified into other variants to include more capable fire control systems with thermal imaging system for the gunner and improved commander sights.
