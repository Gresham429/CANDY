Description of Sho%27t: 
The Sho't was the hebrew name given by the Israeli Armed Forces to the Centurion tanks and their different versions. The first Sho't was a Centurion Mk.5/1 without any relevant modification. The Sho't was introduced into israel during the 1960s as an effort by the IAF to modernize their tank force. At that time the IAF only operated modernized Shermans and several WW2 modified vehicles that were no match for the M48s and T-54s in service with the Arab nations.
