History of TCM-20: 
During the 1960s, Israeli engineers took to modifying the American M45 anti-aircraft turret in service with the IDF at the time, in order to increase its effectiveness against fast modern aircraft. As a result, the engineers replaced the original quadruple 12.7 mm machine guns with a pair of HS.404 20 mm cannons salvaged from obsolete French jet fighters of the IAF. This new anti-air turret became known as the TCM-20 of which several hundred were converted from the original M45 design.
