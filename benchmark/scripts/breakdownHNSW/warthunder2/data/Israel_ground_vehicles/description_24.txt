Description of Magach_Hydra: 
Very little is known about the Magach 6R Hydra the vehicle-mounted two Hydra-70 rocket launchers with M261 rockets. Just a single prototype was built and tested, in this case, in Suez in 1981. The tank was built over the Magach 6R but strapped from its Blazer ERA. It carried a total of 38 rockets with the pods being mounted at a slight angle relative to the position of the gun.
