Description of MARS_15: 
The MARS 15 is a French light tank prototype that was designed and built by Creusot-Loire Industrie with the support of Renk, SAM, Valeo, and Baudouin cooperations between the 1980s and 1992. It was originally intended for export to replace the now-obsolete AMX-13 light tanks, one of the best-selling tank series in the world with 35 client nations between 1953 and 1985, and forty years of service and remarkable success in France and abroad due to their simplicity and versatility. The MARS 15 was originally shown at the Satory 90 exhibition and then again at Eurosatory in 1992, with an upgraded variant for the final time. However, the MARS 15 failed to meet expectations and was never mass-produced on a large scale, despite having several advantages, such as modularity, and failed to gain international popularity, much like the AMX-40 main battle tank. As a result, the project was eventually cancelled.
