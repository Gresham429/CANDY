Description of SANTAL: 
Developed in the late 1980s, the SANTAL was adapted from the VAB APC platform to fulfill the Self-Propelled Anti-Air (SPAA) role. This evolution was marked by the integration of the Mistral surface-to-air missile system in 1987, providing the vehicle with robust air defense capabilities. The Mistral SPAA variant of the SANTAL became a vital component of France's air defense strategy, offering rapid deployment and engagement of aerial threats. Its introduction addressed the need for enhanced protection of ground troops against airborne threats, such as helicopters and low-flying aircraft. The integration of Mistral missiles greatly increased the operational flexibility of the SANTAL, enabling it to effectively contribute to both ground-based and mobile air defense operations. Through its historical development and adaptations, the SANTAL-Mistral remains a testament to the evolution of modern military vehicles, showcasing the fusion of armoured transport with sophisticated air defense systems.
