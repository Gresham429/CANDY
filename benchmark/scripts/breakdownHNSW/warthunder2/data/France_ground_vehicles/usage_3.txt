Usage of AMC.35_(ACG.1): 
This light tank is quite a funny little thing to play with in terms of playstyle and tactics to use. First of all, the armour is basically nothing, and its gun isn't the most powerful thing to tote around in (while standing out from other early French tanks for its normal reload time), though its mobility is quite okay. It is also one of the first French tank to hold 3 crew members inside its hull, which grants the player a better survivability. The AMC.35 plays almost as any other light tanks, the only difference being its reduced mobility, which may be an issue when having to retreat promptly. Since the mobility is average, prefer large flanking manoeuvres and stay away from frontline action. Tactics are terrain specific.
