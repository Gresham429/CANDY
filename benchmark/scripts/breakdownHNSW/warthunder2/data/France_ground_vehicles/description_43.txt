Description of AMX_M4: 
In the late 1940s, the French Army sought to replace its aging medium tanks with a new 50-ton medium tank that would serve as the main asset in armored divisions. The French company AMX initially proposed an under-armored version of the Tiger II tank with 30mm plates, but after feedback from the army, the armor was enhanced to 80mm in the front and 40mm on the sides. Changes were made to reduce weight in other aspects of the tank, such as introducing a new oscillating turret and redesigning the suspension wheels. The first prototype, named M4, featured a 90mm SA47 gun and was slightly over 50 tons. A second prototype with a 100mm SA 47 L/50 gun led to the development of the AMX-50 tank.
