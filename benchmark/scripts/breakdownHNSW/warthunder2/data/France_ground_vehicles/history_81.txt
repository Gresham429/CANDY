History of Leclerc_S2: 
The Leclerc Série 2 Tranche 6 was the 9th version of the Leclerc (counting prototypes) which had minor improvements compared to the previous Leclerc Série 1 Tranche 2-5. It featured an increase on the commander's optic periscope armour to STANAG 3. An air conditioner was added, as well as lockable baskets and boxes on the turret's bustle. A wave deflector was added at the frontal plate, as well as addition of one piece rubber plating on side skirts. Later models of the S2, more specifically the Leclerc S2T9, were retrofitted with V5 tracks instead of V2 tracks as well as a new General Purpose Sight (gunner's optics) at the end of their life service in order to standardise them for further Leclerc Série 3 also known as SXXI.
