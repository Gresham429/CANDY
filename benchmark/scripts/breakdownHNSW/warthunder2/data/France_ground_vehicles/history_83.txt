History of Leclerc_SXXI: 
Leclerc S2 main battle tanks were produced in France from 1997 to 2003. The vehicles in the second series were distinguished by improved armour in the hull and turret, new air conditioning and anti-nuclear protection systems, a modified transmission, and updated electronic and optical systems. The Leclerc SXXI is the third production series of the modern main battle tank that was produced from 2003 to 2006. The main features of the series were improved turret protection at frontal angles, as well as a new panoramic HL 120 sight for the commander with a thermal imaging channel and a laser rangefinder. All tanks in the SXXI series were later upgraded by the ICONE tactical control system under the 2007 program.
