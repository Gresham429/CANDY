Usage of AMX-50_Foch: 
The AMX-50 Foch does well in concealment, and so the first thing to do upon spawning onto the battlefield is to find a place where the AMX-50 Foch can hide while having a good arc of fire against incoming enemies. Do this to minimise the weak points of the vehicle, such as the weak side armour and the long reload time. If the enemy sees only the front armour, it should be fine given the thick, sloped armour available, but do take note on the type of enemy encountered.
