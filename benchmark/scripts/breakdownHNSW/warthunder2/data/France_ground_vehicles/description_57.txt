Description of AuF1: 
The AMX-30 AuF1 Canon Automoteur de 155 GCT is the first variant of the AMX-30 AuF1 self-propelled guns family. Although it is an entirely new family, it is closely related to the AMX-30 main battle tank family, particularly the AMX-30B and AMX-30B2 variants. The vehicle was built on the AMX-30 main battle tank chassis to offer tactical artillery support to units in the French Army, who designated it the AMX-30 AuF1. The vehicle is mounted with a 155 mm CN 155 AuF1 howitzer and an autoloader, with a maximum range of 30 kilometres and a rate of fire of eight rounds per minute. The vehicle is equipped with 42 rounds of ammunition in combustible cartridge casings. The decision to develop a self-propelled howitzer dates back to 1969, with the first prototype produced in 1972. By 1979, seven prototypes and six pre-series vehicles had been built, followed by the manufacture of 110 vehicles. This order was later raised to a total of 190 units.
