Usage of AMX-32_(105): 
Patience is key to using the AMX-32 (105) in all game modes. Although the tank has been stabilized, it remains ineffective as a 'run and gun' tank. The best ways to play the AMX-32 (105) is to take it slow when moving up, use lots of cover and wait for the enemies to come to you, and avoid autocannon armed vehicles. When engaging vehicles with autocannons, be as cautious as possible as they are your most dangerous enemy. If you're found in a situation where you both know each other's location, do not attempt to go head to head with them, as this will result in your death. Either reposition your tank to a new location or wait until their attention is diverted to a different vehicle to push out and attack.
