Description of M4A3_(105)_(France): 
During the Second World War, most French tank units were modelled in a similar structure to US Armored Divisions, but with French traditions and depending on the divisions, cavalry traditions. With this in mind, France operated M4A3 (105) self-propelled howitzers in its tank divisions, to provide direct fire support for infantry units, and offer a higher protection platform for artillery support, which allowed the units to operate closer to the front than regular artillery or mortar systems without much risk. The French 2nd Armored Division was the first to acquire the tanks in 1944, with the 1st and 5th divisions getting their own tanks in 1945.
