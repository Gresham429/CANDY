Description of MEPHISTO: 
The Véhicule de Combat Anti-Char, or MEPHISTO (Module Élévateur Panoramique Hot Installé Sur Tourelle Orientable) was a pivotal chapter in the French military's anti-tank capabilities. Developed and introduced in the 1970s, with the first prototypes emerging around 1978, the MEPHISTO represents a significant leap forward in anti-armour warfare. Armed with the formidable HOT (Haut Subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) anti-tank missile, the MEPHISTO serves as a versatile and potent anti-tank armoured platform. The integration of the HOT missile system onto the turret provides precise and long-range engagement capabilities against armoured threats, ensuring the protection of the platform. This historical timeline showcases France's commitment to arming its military with cutting-edge technologies, enabling it to effectively counter armoured adversaries and adapt to evolving battlefield dynamics.
