Description of M26_(France): 
Seeking out a replacement to the ubiquitous M4 Sherman, the US Army produced the T26E3 heavy tank after a long production run fraught with delays. Later re-designated the M26 Pershing, its arrival late in 1945 meant that it had little effect in the course of World War II. Due to their late arrival, and a comparatively large production run of 2212 tanks meant that the US Army soon found itself with a surplus of tanks it had little need for. Thus, most Pershings were used for the Korean war, or lent out to allies such as Belgium and France. While other allies retained on to their M26 fleet for longer, Belgium retaining it till 1969, France quickly swapped them out for M47 Pattons.
