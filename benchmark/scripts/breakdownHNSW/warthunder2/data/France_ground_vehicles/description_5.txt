Description of H.39: 
The Char léger modèle 1935 (Hotchkiss) H modifié 39 is a heavily upgraded Char léger modèle 1935 (Hotchkiss) H cavalry tank from 1939. Since cavalry units sought a faster tank, it was decided in October 1936 to modernize its current tanks by installing a more powerful engine. In 1937, a new prototype with a 120 hp engine was created in place of the 78 hp engine. The hull was stretched to provide enough space to accommodate it, resulting in a taller, nearly level engine deck. Aside from episcopes, tails, and various radio sets, this included the gradual introduction of a larger 37 mm SA38 L/35 tank gun with much improved anti-tank capabilities, providing 30 mm of armour penetration at 1 km.
