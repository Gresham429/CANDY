Usage of AMX-30_ACRA: 
The AMX-30 ACRA is a very unique vehicle. As a vehicle that relies entirely on its ATGM for engaging enemy vehicles, the ACRA is more akin to something like the German RakJPz 2 (HOT) than it is to something like the AMX-30 series it's based on due to one single factor: its lack of a stabilizer.
