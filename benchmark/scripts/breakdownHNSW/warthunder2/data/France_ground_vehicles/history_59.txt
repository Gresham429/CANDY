History of AMX-50_Foch: 
During the early 1950s, DEFA worked to produce the third version of the AMX-50 heavy tank which featured a 120 mm self-propelled gun, however, during upgrades weight became a factor severely hampering the speed of the vehicle. 1955 saw a team of seventy German engineers brought in to help solve the problem maintaining the 120 mm cannon plus have the necessary armour and maintain a 65 km/h speed. Due to the delays and problems encountered during construction, only five prototypes were constructed and only one was finished which became known as the Canon Automoteur AMX-50 Foch, named after the supreme allied commander during World War I, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, general and military theorist. The main purpose of the AMX-50 "120 mm" was to provide long-range support for the medium AMX-50 "100 mm" tanks. An ambitious task of designing a version with a 155 mm cannon was started, however, this never made it past the drawing stage.
