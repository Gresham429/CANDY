Description of AMX-13_DCA_40: 
The AMX-13 Défense Contre Avions (DCA) canon de 40 mm is the fourth variant of the AMX-13 light tank family. Due to a scarcity of self-propelled anti-air (SPAA) vehicles in France following World War II, attempts were undertaken in the 1950s to repurpose existing tank chassis for anti-air tasks. The main weapon of the prototype is a 40 mm Mle51 T1 cannon based on the 40 mm Bofors L/70 cannon. The resulting vehicle is called the AMX-13 Défense Contre Avions (DCA) canon de 40 mm, and it is comprised of an AMX-13/75 FL10 chassis with a rear-mounted armoured SAMM S-980 turret that allows firing at 90° elevation. With its sloped sides and full 360° traverse, the turret provided adequate overall protection.
