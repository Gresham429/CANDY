Description of Leclerc: 
The Leclerc SÃ©ries 1 is the first variant of the Leclerc main battle tank family. It was developed and manufactured by Nexter Systems. It was named after Marshal Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, a Free French Forces commander who led the 2nd Armoured Division during World War II. In 1992, the Leclerc main battle tanks replaced the AMX-30 main battle tanks as France's primary armoured platform. All variants of the Leclerc main battle tanks are armed with a 120 mm GIAT CN120-26 F1 tank gun designed by the Arsenal de Bourges (EFAB). It has a longer barrel than most main battle tanks of its generation, which gives it a higher muzzle velocity. Instead of the typical four-crew configuration found in most Western main battle tanks, it employs a three-crew configuration. This is mostly due to the implementation of an autoloader in the turret bustle. Creusot-Loire Industrie developed the autoloader in the turret bustle, which is known as Chargement Automatique. A total of 134 units were manufactured.
