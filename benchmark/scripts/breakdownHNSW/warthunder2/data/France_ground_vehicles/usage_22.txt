Usage of CCKW_353_AA: 
This specific truck plays similar to Soviet and German truck-based SPAAs, where high calibre and slow rate of fire are their mark of distinction. One can definitely use the CCKW as a front line AA, defending its teammates against enemy planes while remaining very potent at destroying tank. With its high reload speed, rate of fire, and gun traverse, it can switch very quickly from one role to another. While not being the best SPAA nor the best TD, it surely is a very balanced deal between the two.
