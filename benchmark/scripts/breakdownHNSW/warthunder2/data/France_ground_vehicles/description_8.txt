Description of R.35_(SA38): 
The Char l√©ger d'accompagnement 1935 R (SA38) was the most common tank in the French Armed Forces at the start of WWII, with 900 units in active service. The tank was doctrinally intended for infantry support, being fielded in infantry tank battalions, as such, the vehicle had a very poor anti-tank performance. Not all R.35s received the SA 38 gun, instead, H.35s and H.39s had priority in this aspect. A limited version of the R.35 sometimes referred as R.40 saw limited service. A few were used by the French Resistance during the fall of Paris in 1944.
