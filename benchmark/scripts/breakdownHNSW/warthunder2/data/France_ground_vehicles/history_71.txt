History of AMX-32_(105): 
With designs starting in 1975 for the AMX-32 series main battle tanks Ateliers de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux and Atelier de Construction de Puteaux presented the first prototypes produced in June 1979 at Satory VII Exhibition of Military Equipment and Weapons. This version, the AMX-32 (105) consisted of a reworked turret, moving from cast homogeneous armour to rolled homogeneous armour, alongside adding the M527 gyrostabilized panoramic sight for the commander. The AMX-32's chassis underwent a revision, which included changing the front glacis armour from 79 mm cast homogeneous armour to 35 mm rolled homogeneous armour. To enhance HEAT projectile protection, 6 mm rolled homogeneous armour skirts were added to cover the tracks and lower side plate. Although the tank was intended for export, there were no export orders received, and the AMX-32 project was ultimately scrapped soon after.
