History of M4A3_(105)_(France): 
Each US tank regiment was equipped with a few 105 mm M4A3 at the end of WW2. Their role was to support the other armoured units by destroying fortifications and obstacles. The M4A3 (105) was not provided officially to the Free French Forces through the lend-lease program. However, as they were embedded under US command in preparation of the invasion of France, a few French armoured divisions received the tank from US Army stocks.
The French 2nd Armoured Division received several M4A3 (105) under those circumstances in the UK in 1944. The 1ère and 5ème Divisions Blindées (1st and 5th Armored Divisions) were first equipped with M4A3(105) Shermans in April 1945. 18 M4A3(105) Shermans had been listed as authorized in January 1945, but they were not listed as on hand until April 29 - May 5. From images it can be seen that many of those tanks were M4(105)s, but at least one was an M4A3(105).
