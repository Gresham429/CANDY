Description of AMX-30B2: 
The AMX-30B2 is the first upgraded subvariant of the AMX-30B, which is the second variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. Due to transmission reliability problems, the French Army began upgrading its tank fleet to AMX-30B2 standards in 1979, which included a new transmission, a new Hispano-Suiza HS-110-S2 diesel engine, and the introduction of the new OFL 105 F1 armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. A laser rangefinder and thermal imaging equipment are also included for the gunner. The AMX-30B2 entered service in 1982. A total of 700 units were upgraded to this standard.
