History of AMC.35_(ACG.1): 
The Renault ACG.1 French tank (also known as the AMC.35) was a pre-war development of the earlier unsuccessful AMC.34 light tank design. The ACG.1 was originally supposed to have equipped the three French cavalry divisions, but the first vehicles delivered to the army in 1937 were deemed unsuitable due to mechanical unreliability and rejected. As with its predecessor, lack of armour was also seen as an issue by the army. The vehicle was the first French tank with a two-man turret: initially the plan had been to use the 25 mm anti-tank gun as the main armament, but due to insufficient supply this would be later changed to the same 47 mm gun as the Somua and Char B1 bis, the SA35. The Belgian Army saved the program by purchasing 12 ACG.1 in 1937. The tanks were delivered over the next two years, but without turrets. By 1939, eight turrets had also been received, which had been converted in Belgium to use the Belgian 47 mm FRC M32 anti tank gun, comparable to the French SA35, and a different coaxial machine gun and mounted on the hulls. Formed into a single squadron, they fought and were destroyed or captured during the fall of Belgium the next year.
