Usage of Char_25t: 
The Char 25t is a very fast tank with little protection so engaging enemy tanks frontally is ill-advised. Thanks to its good mobility and a reversible gearbox that enables to disengage just as swiftly, it can resort to flanking to perform in combat. The Char 25t can engage all but the heaviest (e.g. IS-3) targets at close range and it can reliably engage targets from the side at range. However, remember that you are in a light tank so make sure not to be in the enemy's direct line of fire. Your engine may absorb a hit or two, but do not rely on it for survival.
