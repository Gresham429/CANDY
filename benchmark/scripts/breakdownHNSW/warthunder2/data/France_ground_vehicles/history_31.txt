History of M4A4_(France): 
The M4A4 was a M4 variant exclusively manufactured for export purposes. They equipped British, French, Italian and French armies.
The M4A4 (France) were provided officially to the Free French Forces through the lend-lease program alongside the M4A2 in 1943 and 1944.
656 Shermans were allocated to the Free French Forces: 274 M4A4 and 382 M4A2. The first M4A4 were delivered in 1943 in the ports of Algiers and Casablanca to equip French Armoured Divisions. They were then transported to the UK in 1944 in preparation of the invasion of France and saw combat action in France in 1944 and in Western Germany in early 1945.
