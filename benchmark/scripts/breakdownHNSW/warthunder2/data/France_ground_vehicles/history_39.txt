History of M4A1_(FL10): 
In the mid-1950s, while M4 tanks were being replaced in the French Army because of their obsolescence, attempts at modernizing the Shermans were conducted to export those tanks instead of scrapping them. The M4 FL10 by the company Batignolles-Chatillon was such an attempt: born from the assembly of a FL10 turret (designed for the AMX-13) and the hull of a M4 Sherman (all variants of Sherman were used: M4, M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, M4A4 but the in-game variant is a M4A1).
