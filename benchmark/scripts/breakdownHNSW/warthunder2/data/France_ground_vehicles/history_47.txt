History of Panther_%22Dauphin%C3%A9%22: 
The Panther "Dauphin√©" was part of a large French program of rehabilitation of Panzers left by the Wehrmacht after D-Day. This program was led by the Captain Besnier who succeeded to form a little tank brigade of almost 20 old panzers: mostly Panzer IVs but also 2 Panthers and even 2 Tigers. The "Commando Besnier" fought during the encirclement of Saint-Nazaire, the last city still under German control on the 11 of May 1945 and then took part in the French Occupation of Germany at the end of the war. Some of the tanks have been attributed to the 3rd Armored Division at the end of 1945 and were kept mobilized for some months before being replaced. Some of the models have been given to museum (the Tiger can be seen in the museum of Saumur in France).
