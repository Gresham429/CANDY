Description of AMX-10RC: 
The AMX-10 Roues-Canon (RC) is the first variant of the AMX-10 RC armoured fighting vehicle family. The AMX-10 RX, developed and built by Nexter Systems for armoured reconnaissance purposes, has been equipping French cavalry forces since 1981, with over 240 still in service with the French Army in 2021. Morocco bought 108 units, while Qatar bought 12. The vehicle is best described as a wheeled tank destroyer. It has sometimes also been referred to as a light tank, though this classification is debatable. The AMX-10 RC is armed with a medium-pressure 105 mm F2 BK MECA L/47 tank gun mounted in a three-man GIAT Industries TK 105 turret. A SAMM CH49 electrohydraulic gun control system is used in the turret. The main armament lacks a fully automatic stabilization system. The AMX-10 RC differs from the amphibious AMX-10P in that they share automotive components but serve entirely different tasks on the battlefield. The AMX-10 RC is typically utilized for reconnaissance missions in dangerous areas or to provide fire support for troops.
