Usage of M4A4_(SA50): 
Experienced Sherman commanders will like this tank as it drastically increases this old boy's lethality. This tank is a very good representative of the medium tank line, with average mobility, sufficient armour and enjoyable firepower. Get into position, manage to avoid shots doing so and play any role an average tank can fit into: sniper, brawler, flanker, etc.
