Usage of 2C: 
The char 2C should be used as a breakthrough tank, it is too slow to flank and has not enough penetration to shoot from afar. Its APHE shell has enough penetration to knock out almost anything at close range with its 285 g of TNT, making it ideal against open-topped vehicles, Panzer IIIs and IVs. Your greatest enemies will be high-calibre howitzers (SU-122, Ho-Ro, 15cm sIG 33 B Sfl, etc.): you should always avoid direct confrontation with them. In an uptier, the Char 2C will struggle penetrating heavy tanks like the Matilda III. Despite its slow speed, the Char 2C performs well on open maps like Normandy.
