Description of Lorraine_40t: 
The Char de bataille de 40 tonnes (40 tons battle tank), also known as the Lorraine 40t (Lorraine is both a region of France and the company that made this tank), is a rank V French medium tank 
with a battle rating of 7.0 (AB), 7.7 (RB), and 7.3 (SB). It was introduced in Update 1.75 "La RÃ©sistance". Introducing tremendous firepower at its BR with its 100 mm SA46 L/58 gun on a highly mobile chassis. Unfortunately, it is plagued with poor armour, which encourages a battle role more similar to that of a light tank.
