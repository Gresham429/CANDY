Description of E.B.R._(1951): 
The Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1951 is the first variant of the Panhard E.B.R. armoured car family. In general, the Panhard E.B.R. armoured car is an 8x8 wheeled armoured car built on the basis of the previous Panhard AM 40 P/Model 201, an armoured car born before World War II but only at the prototype level. All variants of the Panhard E.B.R. armoured car family are powered by a 200 horsepower 6 litre 12HD horizontally opposed air-cooled 12-cylinder engine (with dual carburettors and 6.6:1 compression, allowing it to run on low-octane petrol) and had a crew of four: two drivers (front and rear), and a gunner and a commander, both sitting in the oscillating turret. The engine was located beneath the fighting compartment's floor, which necessitated the removal of the turret in order to perform extensive engine repairs. The Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1951 was the first mass-produced variant, with around 836 units manufactured between 1951 and 1954. The main armament is a 75 mm SA 49 tank gun that was manually loaded and mounted in a round-shaped FL 11 oscillating turret. The ammunition and ballistics of the US Army 75 mm M3 and M6 tank guns were shared by the SA 49 tank gun.
