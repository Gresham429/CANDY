Description of AMX-13_(HOT): 
The AMX-13/75 FL-10 (HOT) is the fourth subvariant of the AMX-13/75 FL-10, which is the first variant of the AMX-13 light tank family. Except for the six HOT anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) installed on two launchers next to the turret, it is similar to the standard AMX-13/75 FL-10. The HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) is a second-generation long-range ATGM. It was designed to replace the older SS.11 wire-guided ATGMs used in French and West German service. The design was created in partnership with the German company Bölkow and the French company Nord. HOT ATGMs have a greater range, higher flight speed, and are semi-automatically guided rather than manually guided like SS.11 ATGMs. It has become one of the most successful missiles in its class, with tens of thousands of missiles manufactured, utilized by more than a dozen countries throughout the world, and deployed in several wars.
