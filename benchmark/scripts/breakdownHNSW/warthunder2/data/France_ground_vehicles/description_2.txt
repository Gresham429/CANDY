Description of AMD.35: 
The Automitrailleuse de Découverte (AMD) Panhard modèle 1935 is a light French reconnaissance 4x4 armoured car built for cavalry units prior to World War II. It was crewed by four individuals and armed with a powerful 25 mm SA35 L/72 tank gun. The AMD Panhard modèle 1935 had been kept as light as possible to fulfil its role as an effective long-range reconnaissance vehicle. The mobility was impressive for the time: a top speed of 72.6 km/h, a cruising speed of 47 km/h, and a practical range of approximately 300 km made possible by two fuel tanks, the main one positioned at the far back of the hull. Following the fall of France in 1940, a few of these vehicles were taken over by the Germans and designated Panzerspähwagen P204 (f).
