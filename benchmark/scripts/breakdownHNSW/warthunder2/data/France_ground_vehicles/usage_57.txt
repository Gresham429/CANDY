Usage of AuF1: 
This vehicle is quite versatile and powerful with its high explosive and fuze shells, however it comes at a cost. The AuF1 is the very definition of a glass cannon: this vehicle is incredible at close and medium range engagements, but has troubles sniping long distances on account for its subpar muzzle velocity. Awareness of the battlefield is required while playing this vehicle, as it has such little armour that heavy machine guns can easily penetrate. Used right, this vehicle can be a significant asset to the battlefield as a well aimed shot can instantly take down even the most armoured of targets, and its proximity fuze shell has a chance of taking out a lightly armoured vehicle even behind cover.
