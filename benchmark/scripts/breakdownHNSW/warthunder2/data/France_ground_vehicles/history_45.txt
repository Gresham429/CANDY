History of CA_Lorraine: 
In the late 1940s, the French Army was looking to replace the medium tanks Panther and ARL 44 that were becoming obsolete with a new 50t medium tank. Other concepts were explored in parallel to the 50t medium tank: a 25t light tank and a 25t light tank destroyer. The French company Lorraine was tasked with the tank destroyer bid and proposed the Canon d'Assaut Lorraine. Clearly inspired from the layout of the Jagdpanzer IV and the Jagdpanther, the CA Lorraine was to assume the same support role on the battlefield along light and medium tanks.
