History of VBCI-2_(MCT30): 
In the early 1990s, the French government started the VBM (Véhicule Blindé Modulaire — Modular Armoured Vehicle) as a replacement for its older IFVs. Soon the project caught the attention of Germany and the United Kingdom, nations that were also operating aging IFVs like the German Marder. The first prototype was unveiled in 1996 and was called X8A. However the joint program was abandoned and France continued the project on their own with 700 units ordered in 2000.
