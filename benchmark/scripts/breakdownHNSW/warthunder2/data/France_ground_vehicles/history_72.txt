History of AMX-32: 
As soon as the AMX-30B entered service in 1966, it was clear that it would not be able to face the newly introduced Soviet T-64 tank and, as a result, would need to be replaced or dramatically improved over the course of its serviceable life. Therefore, improvements had to be incorporated into the design to keep it competitive. Various development programs saw light at the end of the 1960s and all were ultimately meant to be incorporated into the AMX-30. These improvements had to improve the characteristics of the tank in the three main defining MBT traits: firepower, mobility, and armour, with the company GIAT being the project manager of all studies that were to be undertaken.
