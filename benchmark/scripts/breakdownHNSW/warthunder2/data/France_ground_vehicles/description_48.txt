Description of AMX-13_(SS.11): 
The AMX-13/75 FL-10 (Char Lance SS.11) is the third subvariant of the AMX-13/75 FL-10, which is the first variant of the AMX-13 light tank family. It is identical to the standard AMX-13/75 FL-10, except for the four SS.11 anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) mounted on a launcher above the main armament. Nord Aviation's SS.11 is a French manual command to line-of-sight wire-guided ATGM. It was one of the first ATGMs, entering service with the French Army in 1956 and serving until the 1980s. It also served as the foundation for the larger and more powerful SS.12/AS.12 series. The missile was manually guided by comparing the location of the target to flares on the back of the missile and adjusting its flight with a small joystick.
