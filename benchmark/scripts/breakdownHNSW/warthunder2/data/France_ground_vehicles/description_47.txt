Description of Panther_%22Dauphin%C3%A9%22: 
Throughout the development of WWII after D-Day, French forces made an effort to capture and rearm as many German panzers as possible. Most of these tanks were Panzer IVs, however, a small number of Panthers and Tigers were also used by France. A number of Panthers were captured at the Battle of Dompaire after the French surrounded a Panzer Battalion, however not all the tanks captured during this encirclement were used due to logistical reasons. In the end, all tanks of this type were replaced shortly after the end of WWII.
