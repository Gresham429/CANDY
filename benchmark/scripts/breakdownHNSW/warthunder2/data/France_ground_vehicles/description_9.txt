Description of D2: 
The Char D2 was a French medium tank operated during the interwar period between World Wars I and II. While the Char D1 was ordered, a design was developed to create a more advanced tank. The Char D1 had already evolved from an infantry support tank to a medium tank capable of engaging and eliminating enemy tanks. This made it the obvious candidate as a replacement for the Char B1 heavy tank, as the latter was on the verge of being prohibited by an armament limitation treaty under the auspices of the League of Nations, which would impose a weight limit of twenty metric tonnes for armoured fighting vehicles.
