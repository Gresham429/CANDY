Description of AMX-30_(1972): 
The AMX-30B is the second variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. Many enhancements were made during the production run. Beginning in 1972, the original coaxial M2HB Browning heavy machine gun was replaced with a dual-purpose 20 mm GIAT M693 autocannon capable of depressing from -8° and elevating to 40° in the vertical axis to provide improved deterrence against enemy lightly armoured vehicles and helicopters. Furthermore, all units of the first AMX-30 variant were upgraded to the newer AMX-30B specification.
