Description of Char_25t: 
The Batignolles-Chatillon Char 25t was a French early Cold War tank developed by the Batignolles-Chatillon company in 1954. The vehicle was never developed further than the two prototypes. It was built for a weight class of 25 tons, which is approximately double the weight of the AMX-13 light tanks. It was armed with a 90 mm D.911 APX tank gun and was manned by four crew members. Its top speed is 65 km/h. Despite the project being abandoned, several of the design ideas and technology were applied to subsequent French armoured vehicles. It never saw duty with the French Army.
