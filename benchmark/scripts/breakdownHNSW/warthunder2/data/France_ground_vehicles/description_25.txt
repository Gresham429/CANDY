Description of M10_GMC_(France): 
France operated a number of â–„3-inch Gun Motor Carriage M10 tank destroyers between 1943 and 1945. A total of 227 units of this tank destroyer were received by Free French forces during that time period. The tanks participated in actions in Italy, France, and Western Germany. Particularly remarkable was the M10's role with the French 2nd Armored Division at the Battle of Dompaire, destroying a total of 60 tanks, with the coordination of the TDs, Shermans, and American CAS. It was regarded at the time as the fastest destruction of a Panzer Unit on the western front, with the French forces taking few casualties. The M10s were crucial in the preparation for the battle, attacking German positions at Damas-et-Bettegney.
