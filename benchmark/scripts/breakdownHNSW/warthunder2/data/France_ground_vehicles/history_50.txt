History of AML-90: 
The AML-90 is a variant of a light armoured car developed by the French company Panhard in the late 1950s. It was designed to replace the older and less capable scout vehicles that the French Army had used during World War II, such as the AMD 35, Laffly S15, and the Daimler Ferrets. The AML family of cars had a four-wheel drive chassis, a three-man crew, and the AML-90 had a 90 mm low-pressure gun that could fire high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells. The AML-90 was also very agile and compact, making it suitable for reconnaissance and raiding missions in various terrains.
