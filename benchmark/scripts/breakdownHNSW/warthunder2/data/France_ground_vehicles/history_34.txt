History of M4A3E2_(France): 
Due to the low numbers of M4A3E2 issued to the ETO, most went towards the US Army units. However, there is one known M4A3E2 that was issued to the French 1st Armoured Division (Division Blindée (DB)), an unusual case as most of the M4A3E2 inventory was headed to the Twelfth United States Army Group, whereas the French 1st DB was with the US Sixth Army Group. Information is not well known about this sole M4A3E2, but it served in the headquarter platoon of the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd African Chasseur Regiment (2e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique). On 16 April 1945, lieutenant Amédée de Falgayrac, commander of the 1st platoon in the 2nd Squadron, was killed by shrapnel at Ortenberg, Germany. The M4A3E2 was then renamed Lt Falgayrac a few days later in honour.
