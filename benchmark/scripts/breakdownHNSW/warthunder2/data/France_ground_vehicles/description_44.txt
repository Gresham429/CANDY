Description of AMX-10P: 
The AMX-10P is considered one of the first French IFVs. Developed after a request to replace its predecessor, the ageing AMX-VCI, the AMX-10P's first prototype was completed eleven years after the production of the AMX-VCI in 1968. The AMX-10P features a Hispano-Suiza HS-115 engine, which gives the platform 275 horsepower and allows the AMX-10P to reach speeds of up to 65 km/h. Its main armament, the 20 mm GIAT M693 autocannon shares the same rounds as the commonly seen Rh202 but features a slightly lower fire rate of 740 rounds per minute. However, this main armament was increased several times throughout its lifespan, being augmented with MILAN launchers, or in some instances being replaced with higher calibre autocannons and even high calibre cannons to create variants such as the AMX-10RC and the AMX-10M. In total, approximately 1,800 units of the AMX-10P were produced, with production ending in 1994, being replaced by the VBCI.
