Usage of VBCI-2_(MCT30): 
The VBCI-2 (MCT30) stands as a versatile and potent asset, with its capabilities extending beyond traditional ground warfare. In armoured combat, the VBCI-2 excels in a range of roles, including reconnaissance, and offensive operations. Armed with the MCT30 unmanned turret, equipped with a 30 mm autocannon and supplementary weapons, it possesses exceptional anti-vehicle capabilities, effectively engaging and neutralizing threats both on open terrain and in urban environments. When facing armoured targets, the utilization of MK258 APFSDS rounds enhances its anti-armour capabilities, penetrating protected adversaries. However, it's important to note that the APFSDS rounds may prove lacklustre when confronting Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) frontally due to their formidable armour. Nevertheless, its ability to target the sides and rear of MBTs remains formidable, potentially resulting in their destruction.
