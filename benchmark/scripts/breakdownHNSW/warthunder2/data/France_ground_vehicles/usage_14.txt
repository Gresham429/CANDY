Usage of H.39_%22Cambronne%22: 
The H.39 "Cambronne" was designed as a light infantry tank. It should be played as a support tank, taking advantage of its good cannon, armour and mobility.
By playing as a support tank, you will help kill enemy tanks and thus turn the tide of engagements on the frontline. Once the enemy is destroyed, your mobility allows you to move forward together with frontline tanks and help capturing objectives.
Stay close to the frontline to maximize penetration power and support spearheading tanks with it, all while staying away from the frontline to avoid being flanked or swarmed.
When engaging enemy tanks, angle your tank to maximize your armour. Your cannon can take on most opponents but your only shell lacks post-penetration damage.
