Usage of AMX-32: 
The AMX-32 plays similarly to the AMX-30 in battles. It can be played effectively in ambushes, as a sniper (with its rangefinder and thermal optics), and use cover to the utmost advantage. With the gun stabilizer, you are able to poke out of cover, shoot, and retreat. This is especially useful when sniping, and using "leapfrog" tactics with a friendly vehicle. In the latter case, when the enemy shoots, move out of cover and take a shot, and if you want, use your 20 mm cannon to destroy their cannon barrel. Do not rely on your armour though, as most if not all shots WILL penetrate and make quick work of you. Players must make sure that they either make the enemy shoot and miss or get the first shot off on said enemy. This applies only in one-on-one combat if both the enemy and the AMX-32 see each other. If more than one tank is waiting for you, either retreat and make them come to you, try baiting or flanking, or get a friend to help. On the other hand, being able to shoot and then remove their main means of retaliating via the autocannon proves extremely useful, especially in an ambush. All in all, the AMX-32 is a very capable tank that can quickly return several enemies to the hangar without receiving major damage, if played right.
