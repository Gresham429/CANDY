Usage of AMX-13_(SS.11): 
The AMX-13 is a flanker. This combined with the SS.11 ATGMs on board gives the ability to do two different styles. Either to zoom around (shoot'n'scoot) or stand far back and send missiles flying towards the enemies. In RB though, the missiles are controlled by WASD, making aiming a little bit more difficult. Furthermore, avoid getting shot at all cost. The armour might save you from 0.50 cals, but 14.5 mm and larger will destroy the vehicle in its entirety. Flanking is a viable option, done in the same way as M18, without the penetration needed for frontal armour.
