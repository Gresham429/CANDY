Description of AMX-30_Super: 
The AMX-30 Super is the third upgraded subvariant of the AMX-30B, which is the second variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. A consortium of West German companies designed the AMX-30 Super modernisation package for the AMX-30B (Model 1972) in the late 1980s. AEG, Krupp Atlas Elektronik, MTU, Wegmann & Co., Diehl, ZF Friedrichshafen, and GLS formed the consortium. The power packs were upgraded with a new MTU MB833 Ka501 diesel engine with 850 horsepower, a ZF LSG-3000 automatic transmission, a new engine cooling system, and a fuel capacity increase to 1,028 litres. Upgraded torsion bars, hydraulic shock absorbers, new somewhat wider road wheels, and Diehl Type 234 tracks are also part of the mobility upgrade. The fire control systems have been upgraded with Krupp Atlas Elektronik's MOLF-30 modular laser FCS, a two-plane fully automatic stabilization system, and modern gunner thermal imaging equipment. Additional turret armour is also available per buyer request. A single prototype was created, publicly displayed, and tested in Saudi Arabia. The upgrade was unable to find a customer.
