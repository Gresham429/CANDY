Description of AMC.35_(ACG.1): 
The Char de Combat Renault AMC.35 (ACG.1) was an improved version of the earlier AMC.34 light tank. It faced issues with mechanical reliability and lack of armour, leading to its rejection by the French army. Initially armed with a 25mm gun, it was later upgraded to a 47mm gun. The Belgian Army bought 12 ACG.1 tanks, equipped them with Belgian guns, but they were destroyed or captured during the fall of Belgium. In France, production continued at a slower pace, with less than 50 vehicles made. These tanks saw limited service due to mechanical issues and were pressed into emergency action during WWII.
