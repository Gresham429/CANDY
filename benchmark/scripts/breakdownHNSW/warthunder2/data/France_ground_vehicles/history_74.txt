History of AMX-30_DCA: 
The development of the AMX-30 DCA (also known as the AMX-30SA) began in the year 1969 and it was derived from the AMX-13 DCA, a similar system produced for the French army. While the AMX-30 DCA was made for the French Army, it was also made for export and in the end, none of the DCA's were ordered by the French army. Instead, Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version in the 1975, called the AMX-30SA which included the SA-10 Shaline missiles.
