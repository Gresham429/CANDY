Description of AMR.35_ZT3: 
The Automitrailleuse de Reconnaissance AMR 35 ZT3 was an upgraded version of the AMR.33 light tank, addressing issues with tracks and suspension. Despite being larger and heavier, it was faster and more manoeuvrable thanks to a bigger engine and improved suspension. During the Battle for France in 1940, 167 of these tanks were in service, many equipped with 13.2 mm machine guns. A subvariant called ZT3 was planned to carry a 25 mm anti-tank gun, but only ten were produced and issued before France surrendered.
