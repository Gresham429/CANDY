Description of H.35: 
The Char léger modèle 1935 (Hotchkiss) H is a pre-World War II French cavalry tank. In 1933, it was intended as a low-cost yet well-protected light infantry support tank. The hull was constructed of six bolted-together cast armour parts: the engine deck, the fighting compartment, the front of the hull, the back of the hull, and two longitudinal pieces on the left and right that formed the bottom. Even though the tank was not well regarded by the French Army in general, it was politically unacceptable to stop production. As a result, the first 300 vehicles were offered to cavalry regiments, who were forced to accept them because they would not have been given a budget for other tanks.
