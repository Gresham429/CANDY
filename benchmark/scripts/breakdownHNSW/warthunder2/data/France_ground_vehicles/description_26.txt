Description of B1_ter: 
The Char B1 was a widely used French tank in WWII. It had three modifications, with the final one being B1 ter (this version was conceptualized around the time the Char B1 Bis entered production in 1937). It had improved armour, engine, and crew space. Despite being developed since the 1920s, B1 ter came too late and production was hindered by the war, with a design doctrinally outdated, designed to support infantry assaults, instead of the mechanized and mobile warfare that characterized WWII. Three prototypes were made, but they were lost during France's surrender in 1940.
