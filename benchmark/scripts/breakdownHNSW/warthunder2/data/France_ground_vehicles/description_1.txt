Description of AMC.34_YR: 
The Automitrailleuse de Combat AMC.34 YRwas a cavalry tank designed and fielded during the pre-war period. The tank fielded the same 47 mm SA 34 gun used by the Char B1 and was used on mainland France between 1936 and 1937. The tank was considered poorly armoured, even for a cavalry tank, and was re-armed with a 20mm gun turret and shipped to North Africa. The vehicle was later replaced by the H.39 in late 1939. It should be noted, that the earlier Char D1 and early Char D2 infantry tanks did see wide service, sharing the same gun as the AMC.34 but in a different body, with increased armour at the cost of mobility, 160 D1s were built and served in North Africa.
