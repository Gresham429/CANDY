Usage of SANTAL: 
The SANTAL platform has revolutionized French top tier SPAA in the battlefield, showcasing its dynamic capabilities in safeguarding friendly units from airborne threats. The integration of the Mistral surface-to-air missile system, a highly effective infrared-guided (IR) missile with fire-and-forget capabilities, combined with the vehicle's inherent mobility, has enabled the SANTAL to provide an agile and responsive air defense solution. Notably, Mistral missiles are designed to autonomously track and engage targets using their infrared guidance, without requiring continuous operator input. It's important to mention that Mistral missiles do not trigger defense systems automatically; they are primarily detected and countered by Missile Approach Warning (MAW) systems typically mounted on top-tier helicopters but remain unseen by other aircraft unless visual contact is made. This highlights the critical role of the SANTAL's skilled crew in target acquisition and engagement.
