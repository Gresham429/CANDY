Usage of E.B.R._(1951): 
The E.B.R (1951) is a fast light tank perfect for flanking and capturing points. In open maps, try to be the first in flanking points. Its low muzzle velocity and poor accuracy make its canon unreliable above 600 m. If attacked frontally, try to outspeed or outmanoeuvre your enemy. If immobilised, try to shoot the enemy's canon or weak points. In rural and urban combat, your only strategy will be to flank otherwise you'll not be able to penetrate medium and heavy tanks at this BR. Its weak armour can't resist .50 cal HMGs from the sides so be careful against M18s and Shermans. When threatened by multiple enemies, use the smoke to cover your retreat and do not engage them even if it's to destroy a track or taking an easy shot.
