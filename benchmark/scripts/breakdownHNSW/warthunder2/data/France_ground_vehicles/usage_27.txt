Usage of AMX-13-M24: 
If a player wants to do well in this vehicle, they must understand that playing recklessly in this tank will get you killed immediately. The player's mindset has to be adjusted due to the unusual combination. As with each light tank, the player has to use all tools available, ranging from smoke grenades to optics. It is also recommended to use the roof-mounted .50 cal to aid you on the battlefield. Hug choke points, intersections, and, if needed, push the objective. In Arcade battles, take advantage of the light tank's Airstrike ability to assist in both the air and on the ground. In both Realistic and Simulator battles, spotting is your primary goal, but the player can easily set up ambushes and profit from this premium vehicle.
