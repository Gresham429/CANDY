Usage of SK-105A2: 
The SK-105A2 excels at filling the spot as a sniper, due to its very powerful 105 mm cannon, low profile and high mobility. This is all balanced out however by the fact that the SK-105 possesses little to no armour, so any kind of hit from a cannon more powerful than 20 mm, will dispatch the SK-105 quite easily. The user should always check their surrounding as much they can, and as frequently as they can. Finding a vantage point with cover nearby is an effective strategy. Brawls and rushes should generally be avoided and tactics like flanking or sniping should be focused upon, as the SK-105 will stand no chance in direct engagements or close quarter fights. However, if one does stumble into a brawl, the 4-second autoloader will prove to be a major benefit coupled with the amazing 105 mm cannon; although one should pay attention to their magazine as the user will not be able to shoot at all if the magazine runs dry completely. It is because of this reason that at least 2 spare rounds should be carried in the magazine in case of an ambush. One big thing to note is that the user also lacks a stabilizer, which may be a problem due to the light size of the tank and fast speed; as these properties will make the gun harder to stabilize on its own if the user decides to brake spontaneously.
