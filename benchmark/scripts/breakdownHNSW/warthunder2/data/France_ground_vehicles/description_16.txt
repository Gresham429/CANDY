Description of AMD.35_(SA35): 
The AMD.35 (SA35), also known as Panhard 178, was a 4x4 French reconnaissance armoured car, usually equipped with a 25 mm autocannon. In 1939, a version of the Panhard was unveiled, featuring a 47 mm SA35 cannon, intended to increase the anti-tank capabilities of the vehicle. Not many vehicles received this modification however, instead most SA35 cannons were intended for the Char B and Char D2 series of tanks. Instead, in 1940, Panhard proposed a version of the vehicle with a rearward-facing 47 mm SA37 gun. Due to the increasingly deteriorating situation on the front, the single prototype had to be abandoned and destroyed by its crew, although it managed to see action with the 1er RAM, defending a bridge near Etignie.
