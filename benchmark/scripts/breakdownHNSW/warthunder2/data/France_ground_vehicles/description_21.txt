Description of 2C: 
The Char 2C is a French heavy tank that was eventually designated as a super-heavy tank. It was developed during World War I but did not enter service until after the war was over. In terms of overall volume or physical dimensions, it was the largest operational tank ever built during World War I. The Char 2C was the first super-heavy tank to enter service; purposely designed to be significantly larger than conventional tanks at the time. When fully equipped, the Char 2C weighed 69 tonnes, due in part to its armour, which was among the thickest of World War I tanks, but also to its vast size. The tank required a crew of twelve to operate: a driver, commander, gunner, loader, four machine gunners, a mechanic, electrician, assistant-electrician/mechanic, and a radio operator. Some sources suggest thirteen, most likely on the basis of photos of crews that probably included the company commander.
