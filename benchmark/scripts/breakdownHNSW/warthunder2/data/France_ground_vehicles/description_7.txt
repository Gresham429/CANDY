Description of FCM.36: 
In 1933, the French military sought for the creation of a new infantry tank to replace the Renault FT. The requirements called for a simple tank that was of 6 ton weights and used a cast turret design produced by the government APX workshop. The firm that won the requirement in 1934 was the Renault ZM design that would become the Renault R.35, however the design by FCM proved promising enough due to its welded construction and better turret design that the French army also provided them a production model in 1936. However, production complications due to the relatively advanced welding construction and other production priorities at FCM for the Char B1 bis meant late deliveries and high unit cost that the design had its production halted in 1940. Two battalions in the French army would use the FCM.36, the 4e and 7e, and they would be committed in the Battle of France against the German invasion, most notably seeing use in challenging a German bridgehead over the Meuse river. Upon the capitulation of France, the Germans would utilize the FCM.36 in their military, with one notable use being the conversion of several hulls into the Marder I with a 75 mm PaK 40 cannon as the 7.5cm PaK40(Sf) auf Gesch√ºtzwagen FCM(f).
