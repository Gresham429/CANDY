Description of AMX-13-M24: 
The AMX-13-US is the second subvariant of the AMX-13/75 FL-10, which is the first variant of the AMX-13 light tank family. In 1956, the French Army and the Direction des Etudes et Fabrications d'Armements were looking into cost-effective ways to modernize their fleet of aged M24 Chaffee light tanks. One approach was to combine the hull of the French AMX-13/75 FL-10 light tank with the turret of the American M24 Chaffee. While the official name of this subvariant of the AMX-13/75 FL-10 is AMX-US, it is also known by several unofficial names, including AMX-13 Chaffee, as it was known by troops, and AMX-13 Avec Tourelle Chaffee, which is often seen in some resources. There were only a few of these vehicles built. They first served in French military units tasked with policing colonies like Algeria. When they were no longer needed on the front lines, they were converted into driver-training vehicles.
