History of AMD.35: 
The AMD.35 or Automitrailleuse de Découverte, also known as the Panhard 178 was a French 4x4 specialised long-range armoured reconnaissance car built by Panhard. Designed to a 1931 specification to replace older models of armoured cars, Panhard completed a prototype in October of 1933 which was evaluated in January and February of 1934. Out of four competing models, built by Panhard, Renault, Berliet and Latil, the Panhard design was considered the best, being a highly advanced design for its time. After further trials by the French Cavalry, the Panhard 178 was accepted for production as the AMD Panhard Modèle 1935. Initial use revealed some issues like engine overheating and cracking of the gun sight, resulting in a major modification program in 1937 which saw numerous modifications introduced.
