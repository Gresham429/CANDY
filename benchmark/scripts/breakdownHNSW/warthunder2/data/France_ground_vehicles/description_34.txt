Description of M4A3E2_(France): 
The ▄Assault Tank M4A3E2 Jumbo was mainly issued to US Army Forces due to low production numbers. France operated a large number of M4A3E2 tanks in the early post-war period, since at this time the US wanted to get rid of all of its surplus military vehicles. However, a single M4A3E2 is known to have been issued to the French 1st Armoured Division, serving as the headquarters for the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd African Chasseur Regiment.
