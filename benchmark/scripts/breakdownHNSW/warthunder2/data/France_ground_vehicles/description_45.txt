Description of CA_Lorraine: 
The Canon d'Assaut Lorraine de 100 mm is a French prototype tank destroyer based on the AMX M4 medium tank project's chassis. Following World War II, the French Army launched several programs to replace their antiquated tanks. The Lorraine company was charged with developing a light tank destroyer. The Canon d'Assaut Lorraine used Veil-Picard pneumatic tires instead of regular road wheels, which reduced the vehicle's ground pressure. Another advantage of the tires is that even if the tracks are destroyed, the vehicle can continue to operate. The prototype was started in 1950 but did not finish until 1952. The project was cancelled in 1953. The expertise gained by developing the Canon d'Assaut Lorraine would eventually serve as the foundation for other Lorraine initiatives.
