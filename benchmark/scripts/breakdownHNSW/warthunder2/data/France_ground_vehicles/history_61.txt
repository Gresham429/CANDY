History of AMX-30: 
The AMX-30 is a main battle tank that was designed and produced by the French company Ateliers de construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX). Development of the tank began in the early 1960s, and it entered service with the French Army in 1966. The development of the AMX-30 began in 1960, when the French Army began to look for a replacement for its aging fleet of tanks, which included the M4 Sherman and the AMX-13. The new tank was required to have a low silhouette, be highly mobile, and be capable of engaging targets at long ranges. The design was also required to be cost-effective, as the French Army was operating on a limited budget.
