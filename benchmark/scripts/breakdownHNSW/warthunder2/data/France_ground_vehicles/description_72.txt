Description of AMX-32: 
The AMX-32 P2 is the second prototype subvariant of the AMX-32, which is the third variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. Similar to the AMX-32 P1, it was co-developed in the late 1970s during the Cold War by Ateliers de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux and Atelier de Construction de Puteaux as an export tank to fulfil a particular market niche of nations with limited defence resources. This is the second subvariant, and it is distinguished by its 120 mm GIAT CN120-25 G1 tank gun, as opposed to the 105 mm CN-105-F1 tank gun on the first subvariant AMX-32 P1. In addition, the design of the hull front was changed to enhance ballistic protection. The combat weight of the AMX-32 P2 was increased to 40 tonnes as a result of the preceding modifications.
