Description of AMX-10M: 
The AMX-10M, a unique French tank destroyer,  was developed from the AMX-10P infantry fighting vehicle. The AMX-10M was part of the ACRA project that started in the 1960s, which aimed to create a vehicle capable of firing supersonic ATGMs from a 142 mm smoothbore gun. The AMX-10M retained the same engine, chassis, and 20 mm autocannon as the AMX-10P, but had a modified chassis that housed the ACRA launcher and its missiles. The ACRA missiles had a range of about 4 km and could penetrate up to 700 mm of armour. Ultimately, due to the large associated expenses especially with the ATGMs, funding for the program was terminated at the last stage of testing. Additionally, advances in fire control systems for contemporary armour-piercing projectiles and the ACRA missiles' lack of ability to be deployed on helicopters, as well as the increasing relevance of the HOT ATGM system also contributed to the projects' cancellation.
