Description of S.35: 
The Char de Cavalerie SOMUA 1935 S was a French cavalry tank. It was a remarkably manoeuvrable tank for its period, superior in armour and armament to both its French and foreign counterparts. It was constructed of well-sloped, mostly cast armour parts, which made it costly to create and time-consuming to maintain. The hull and turret were cast armour with maximum thicknesses of 47 mm and 40 mm, respectively; the bottom was made by two longitudinal plates, and the superstructure was separated into front and back sections. The turret was a variant of the APX 1 turret that was primarily used on the Char B1 heavy tank. Similarly to the Char B1 heavy tank, the commander was tasked with directing the tank while also loading, aiming, and firing the 47 mm SA35 L/32 tank gun.
