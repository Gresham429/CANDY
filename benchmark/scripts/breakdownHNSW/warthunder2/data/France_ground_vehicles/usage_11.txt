Usage of AMR.35_ZT3: 
This is a good introduction to a typical tank destroyer's gameplay: a good gun on a fragile chassis and even more. With its low silhouette, the AMR can completely hide itself behind a wide variety of terrain features: wrecked tanks hulls, shallow hills, rocks, brick walls... Staying away from the fight and sniping for unsuspecting enemies. When spotted, choosing to reverse back into cover is a good decision.
