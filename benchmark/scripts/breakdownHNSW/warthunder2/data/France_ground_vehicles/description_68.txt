Description of SK-105A2: 
The SK-105 Kürassier A2 is the third variant of the SK-105 Kürassier light tank family. The initial prototype, developed by Saurer-Werk (now Steyr-Daimler-Puch) to fulfil the Austrian Army's operational needs for a light, mobile anti-tank vehicle, was completed in 1967, and deliveries of pre-production vehicles began in 1971. Over 700 units are estimated to have been produced. The SK-105 Kürassier A2 is based on the chassis of a heavily modified Saurer armoured personal carrier (APC). The hull is constructed of welded steel and is separated into three compartments: the driver sits in the front, the combat compartment is in the middle, and the engine is in the back. Given its light weight, the SK-105 can be airdropped to support paratroopers. The SK-105 Kürassier A2 is an improved variant of the SK-105 Kürassier A1. It has a modern fire control system and an automatic electrical loading system.
