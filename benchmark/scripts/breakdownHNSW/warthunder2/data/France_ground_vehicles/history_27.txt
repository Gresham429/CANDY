History of AMX-13-M24: 
In 1956, the French military attempted to modernise its light tank "fleet", and a few solutions were suggested. One of these was to attach an M24 turret to the newly developed AMX-13 chassis, which lead to the designation AMX-US. Soon, other nicknames were added, like "AMX-13 Chaffee" or "AMX-13 Avec Tourelle Chaffee" (French: AMX-13 with Chaffee turret). A small number of these conversions were produced until the FL11 turret was introduced. These tanks were sent peacekeep and protect French colonial interest, but were soon replaced with the new AMX-13 with an oscillating turret.
