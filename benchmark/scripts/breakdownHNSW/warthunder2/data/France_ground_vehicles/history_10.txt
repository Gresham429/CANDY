History of P.7.T_AA: 
The first half-tracks were built by Frenchman Adolphe Kegresse for Russia in 1910-11. After the First World War Kegresse returned to France to work with Citroen to produce half-tracks for the French Army starting in the 1920s. By 1940, these unarmoured Kegresse-Citroen half-tracks (the P.17, P.19, P.107, and MCG variants) were used primarily for towing artillery, although a small number of closed-top half-track armoured cars (the P.16) were also in service. The P.7.T had been an earlier Kegresse model, built between 1925 and 1927. The French, who had created the first self-propelled anti-aircraft gun-truck back in 1913, would continue through the interwar period experimenting with various truck-mounted AA weapons like those shown in this model.
