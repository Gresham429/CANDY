Usage of Lorraine_37L: 
Virtually unarmoured, the Lorraine 37L is better used to snipe or ambush the enemy. Its gun has a good rate of fire, but many other guns at this rank will reload as fast as yours. The gun is extremely powerful for its rank, which means you will penetrate almost any target, so there is no need to throw yourself in front of the enemy: position yourself at a safe distance from the frontline action. An open-backed SPG should never be flanked: put at least 500 m between you and your target and watch your sides for sneaking foes. While the gun can be sufficient to destroy most enemies in a single shot, more heavily armoured enemies will need several well-aimed shots to be fully disabled. The gun's ballistics are somewhat tricky without a base tracer and the ammo count is limited, so aim carefully and accurately.
At the start of the match, use your good mobility to get to a location overlooking enemy movement routes or a sniping spot to engage advancing enemy vehicles. Make sure to change your position every few shots to prevent enemies from tracking you down and targeting you with either artillery strikes or close air support attacks. Even light machine gun fire is a big threat as most of your crew members sit in the open: planes are very dangerous with the Lorraine 37L having no anti-aircraft armament to counter them. Therefore, it is best to remain hidden or behind cover.
