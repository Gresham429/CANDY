Description of AMX-32_(105): 
The AMX-32 (105) is the first prototype subvariant of the AMX-32, which is the third variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. Ateliers de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux and Atelier de Construction de Puteaux co-developed an export tank in the late 1970s during the Cold War to meet a specific market niche of nations with low defence budgets. Despite the development of six prototypes, there was no interest in foreign sales. In June 1979, the AMX-32 P1, the first prototype of an improved and modified AMX-30 for the export market, was presented. The AMX-32 P1 deliberately duplicated the spaced armour system on the German Leopard 1A3 and Leopard 1A4, resulting in better armour protection and enhanced survivability against anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). However, no orders were ever placed.
