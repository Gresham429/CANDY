Description of AML-90: 
The AML-90 was developed by the French company Panhard in the late 1950s, as a response to a commission by the French Ministry of Defense. It was based on the earlier AML-60, which mounted a 60 mm mortar as its main weapon. The AML-90 replaced the mortar with a DEFA low-pressure 90 mm rifled gun capable of firing high-explosive and high-explosive anti-tank shells. As the developer of the AML-90, France used it extensively, using it for police work, counter-insurgency, and reconnaissance among other tasks.
