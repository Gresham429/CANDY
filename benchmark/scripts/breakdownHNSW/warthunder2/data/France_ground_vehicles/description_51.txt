Description of AMX-13-90: 
The AMX-13/90 C90 is the second variant of the AMX-13 light tank family. The AMX-13/90 C90 uses a bigger, low-pressure 90 mm CN 90 F2 tank gun, similar to how the Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1951 was modified to become the Modèle 1963 Revalorisé. It was designed to compensate for the French Army's lack of anti-tank capabilities at the time.
