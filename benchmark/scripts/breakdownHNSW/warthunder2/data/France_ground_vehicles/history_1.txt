History of AMC.34_YR: 
The AMC.34 was a pre-war cavalry tank design that was not accepted for wide service, being considered insufficiently armoured. A dozen pre-series vehicles were equipped with the APX1-model turret, also used by the pre-war Char B1 tank and mounting the 47 mm SA 34 gun (as shown in-game), and used by the French 4th Cuirassiers in 1936-37, before being re-armed with 20 mm gun turrets and shipped to the French North African colonies for service there. They are believed to have been all replaced by H.39 tanks and taken out of service in late 1939.
