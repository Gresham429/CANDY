Description of Leclerc_AZUR: 
The Leclerc Action en Zone URbaine (AZUR) is an urban warfare modification of the Tropicalized Leclerc, which is the fifth variant of the Leclerc main battle tank family. The Tropicalized Leclerc variant is predominantly employed by the UAE Army and has various enhancements that improve its capacity to fight in humid tropical and scorching desert environments. The tank is powered by a EuroPowerPack 1,100 kW MT883 diesel engine manufactured by the German MTU Friedrichshafen company, as the UAE has an interest in the company and wants the engine produced by them. The fuel capacity has also increased. An externally mounted diesel auxiliary power unit with a tank infantry telephone is installed on its armoured box. On the left side of the hull, an engine-driven mechanical heavy-duty air conditioner is also installed. The commander sights have been customized to include an HL-80 commander panoramic sight, Alis thermal imaging equipment, and a laser rangefinder. An Armement Télé-Opéré remote-controlled weapon station with a 7.62 mm FN MAG light machine gun operated under-armour by the HL-80 panoramic sight is also placed on the roof of the turret. All of these enhancements are completed by the AZUR urban warfare add-on armour kit, which principally comprises explosive-reactive armour (ERA) blocks on the tank's flanks and slat armour shielding the engine.
