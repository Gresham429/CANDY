Description of E.B.R._(1963): 
The Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1963 Revalorisé is a heavy modification of the Panhard Engin Blindé de Reconnaissance (E.B.R.) Modèle 1951, which is the first variant of the Panhard E.B.R. armoured car family. Between 1964 and 1968, 650 units of the Panhard E.B.R. Modèle 1951 variant were modernized, with the original 75 mm SA 49 tank gun replaced by a bigger, low-pressure 90 mm CN 90 F2 tank gun. It was developed to compensate for the lack of anti-tank capabilities within the French Army at the time.
