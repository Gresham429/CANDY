History of AuF1: 
The AMX-30 AuF1 is a French self-propelled gun that was developed in 1969 by Giat Industries (now Nexter) and entered service in the late 1970s. It is based on the AMX-30 main battle tank chassis, and was originally designed as a replacement for the ageing Mk F3 155 mm, which lacked features such as a traversable turret and NBC protection for its crew. Additionally, the Mk F3 155 mm could also carry only two of the four crew members needed to operate it, while the other two had to be transported in support vehicles, qualities the French Government deemed unsuitable by the 1960s.
