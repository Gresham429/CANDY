Usage of AMX-13_DCA_40: 
This SPAA is quite versatile as it can take down both tanks and planes with mitigated efficiency. It has an autocannon that does not fire fast enough to engage planes efficiently, nor does it penetrate enough to shred tanks. As it is, this SPAA is good for front-line use: providing cover for incoming ground attackers to its allies while also securing flanks from fast-movers.
