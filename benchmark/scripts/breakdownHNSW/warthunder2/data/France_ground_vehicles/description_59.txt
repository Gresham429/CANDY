Description of AMX-50_Foch: 
The AMX-50 Heavy Tank was quite powerful, but DEFA wanted to procure a heavier 120mm self-propelled gun, however, problems soon started to appear. The weight was the main factor that hampered the development of the vehicle since the speed was deemed too low. In the end, the Canon Automoteur AMX-50 Foch was developed, named after Marshal Ferdinand Foch. Doctrinally, the AMX-50 Foch was supposed to provide long-range support to the regular AMX-50 tanks, there were plans to upgrade the vehicle with a 155mm cannon but the project was never seriously pursued.
