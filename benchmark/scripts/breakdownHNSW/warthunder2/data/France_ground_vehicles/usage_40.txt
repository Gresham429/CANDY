Usage of Lorraine_155_Mle.50: 
The best method of using the large-calibre weapon on the Lorraine is to exploit the high-explosive power against thin-armour on the enemy. Like other large calibre HE tanks, shooting below an enemy vehicle will penetrate its belly armour. This is an effective, albeit difficult way to engage tanks whose armour is greater than what your HE shell can penetrate.
