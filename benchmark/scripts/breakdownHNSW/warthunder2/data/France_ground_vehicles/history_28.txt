History of LVT-4/40: 
In the wake of WWII, France possessed a large number of American vehicles in its service, including the LVT series of amphibious vehicles. These, along with other armored vehicles, were supplied to France as a short-term solution to rebuild the French military after the war. During the Indochina War of the early 1950's, LVTs in French service were modified to carry the 40 mm Bofors anti-air gun as it proved to be more effective against ground targets than the standard 37 mm cannon. These modified French LVTs also participated in the Suez Crisis of 1956, which also marked their final operational use.
