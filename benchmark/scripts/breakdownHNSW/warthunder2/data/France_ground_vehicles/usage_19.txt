Usage of M4A1_(France): 
The M4A1 Sherman plays greatly in an aggressive role. Firing on the move is not a difficult task with this tank due to the vertical stabilizer. You can use the "battle" cruise gear (press E once) to move at a slower speed so you can engage the vertical stabiliser on the move, without the need to stop the tank. This is beneficial to quickly push the attack. When you are under enemy fire, wiggle your hull slightly to increase the effective thickness a little and to throw the enemies' aim off. But if you know that a tank destroyer is present, do not wiggle at all, drive straight to your next cover.
