Description of AMX-30B2_BRENUS: 
The AMX-30B2 BRENUS is the second upgraded subvariant of the AMX-30B, which is the second variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. Although the Leclerc main battle tank had already been ordered in the 1990s, the AMX-30 main battle tanks continued to play an important role in the French army, and two further upgrades were implemented in limited numbers for the French rapid reaction force, which consisted of two tank regiments, the 1er and 2e Chasseurs. One of these enhancements was BRENUS, an explosive reactive armour (ERA) kit. In terms of protection against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition, the BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS (Brique de Surblindage) G2 explosive reactive boxes, which gave protection comparable to 400 mm of armour at 60Â° impact.
