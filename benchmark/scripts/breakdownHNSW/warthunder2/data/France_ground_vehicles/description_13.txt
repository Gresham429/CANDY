Description of SAu_40: 
The Canon Automoteur DE 75 mm SAu 40 was developed by SOMUA between 1935 and 1937 alongside the S.35 tank for French cavalry. It featured a redesigned hull to house a 75 mm cannon and a new commander's cupola with a machine gun. The prototype was finished in 1939 after delays in acquiring the cannon. It is uncertain if more vehicles were produced or if it saw combat action. Doctrinally, the vehicle was relegated to a support role, intended to provide cover for heavier tanks like the Char B1.
