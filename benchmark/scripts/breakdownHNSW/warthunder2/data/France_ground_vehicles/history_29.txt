History of AMX-13_(FL11): 
In 1952, the First Indochina War had been raging for six years. The French Army was facing a better and better armed enemy and their cavalry units were still equipped with WW2 tanks like the M24 or the M5A1. The French government decided to send the latest developed French tank, the AMX-13, in Indochina. However, the AMX-13 needed to undergo modifications for the South-Eastern theater. The large FL-10 autoloader turret and the long 75 mm gun made the AMX-13 unadapted for the logistical constraints of the colonial conflict (limited air transport capabilities and combat in constricted urban environments).
