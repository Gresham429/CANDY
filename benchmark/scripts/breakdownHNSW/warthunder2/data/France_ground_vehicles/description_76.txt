Description of AMX-30_ACRA: 
The AMX-30 Anti-Char Rapide Autopropuls√© (ACRA) is a unique modification of the AMX-30B (Model 1972), which is the second variant of the AMX-30 main battle tank family. The ACRA research and development program was initiated in France in 1961 and was designed as a supersonic anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) that could be deployed in any of the French Army's tanks. Due to the large associated expenses, state financing for the program was terminated by the last stage of testing the laser guiding system (which was the first of its kind in the world). GIAT, on the other hand, continued work at its own expense, hoping for future government orders. Engineers chose the AMX-30B (1972) as the missile's platform. Among the main turret equipment were a new smoothbore tank gun launcher, a sight, and an electronic guidance device. By 1974, field testing of the weapon platform was successful, but it was not accepted and placed into service. The key concern is the expensive cost of missile targeting technology, as well as the difficulties of using guided missiles in the absence of a tank gun. Instead, the HOT ATGM system, which was nearing completion at the time, was given priority.
