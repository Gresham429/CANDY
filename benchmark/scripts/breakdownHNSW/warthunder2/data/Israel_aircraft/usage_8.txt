Usage of Meteor_F.8_(Israel): 
Like most Meteors, it has very good acceleration, making you one of the first to the battle. This Meteor also has very good climb rate. Pilots can do several strategies to be in superior positions to its opponents. However, some key factors when playing the Meteor are, staying fast, and not commit to a turn fight even if you can win it. Some aircraft at this BR have superior acceleration to the Meteor F Mk.8, so committing to a fight with enemies around would make you a sitting duck, an easy target for pilots that do remember to stay fast.
