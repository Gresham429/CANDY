Usage of Sambad: 
The Sambad is best used as a support fighter, using its high speed energy retention and relatively high top speed for the rank to its advantage. Pilots can use this to attack enemies which are slow or distracted, making slashing attacks and quickly escaping. The use of vertical manoeuvres is also recommended, as the Sambad will maintain a high rate of climb while in the high speed state, allowing the pilot to drain the speed of slower aircraft. if necessary a spiral can also be added to the climb, this is the most effective way to deal with higher ranking Delta-wing designs like the Draken, as they will bleed prodigious amounts of energy while attempting to follow, eventually stalling and allowing the Sambad pilot to drop on the slow opponent. Pilots should note however, that this applies when the Sambad is at high speed, as the energy retention at slower speeds falls off significantly. If the Sambad is caught at a low energy state, it is recommended to force an overshoot, using the excessive energy loss as a benefit. Pilots can then use their cannons, or the Shafrir air-to-air missile to attempt to kill the enemy aircraft as it flies away, and begin to regain speed. It is recommended to avoid this whenever possible, as the plane is best used at high speed. In ground battles, staying low and fast is recommended as the Sambad lacks CCIP, requiring the pilot to close the distance for accurate fire of its bombs and rockets. The Sa'ar which falls behind the Sambad in the tree should be preferred for CAS missions.
