Description of Nesher: 
The Nesher was meant to replace the Shahak in the IAF. It started as a hidden project, basically as a copy of the French Mirage 5 to avoid the embargo imposed over Israel during the Six-Day War. The aircraft started production in Israel in 1969, with a few changes to the design and electronics to suit Israeli needs more precisely. With the help of Dassault Aviation, different parts were smuggled into Israel. It featured Israeli-made avionics, compatibility with Shafrir 2 and AIM-9D AAMs, better range, and an ejection seat. The aircraft showed good performance during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and served with Israel until 1978. Some of the single seat variants of the Nesher found a new owner in Argentina. Many were refurbished and then sold, serving in the Argentinian Air Force until 2015 under the name "Dagger".
