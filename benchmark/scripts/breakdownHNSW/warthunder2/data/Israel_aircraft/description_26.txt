Description of Netz: 
The F-16A Block 10 Netz is a supersonic, 4th generation fighter aircraft, produced by General Dynamics. The F-16 was produced for the USAF as a part of the Lightweight Fighter Program, and notably the early blocks such as the Block 10 did not carry the AIM-7 Sparrow; this is carried over to the Netz in Israeli service. Israel is notably the second largest user of the F-16 after the USAF, and also achieved the first air to air kills with it.
