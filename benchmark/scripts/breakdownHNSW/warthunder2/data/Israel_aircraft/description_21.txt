Description of Kfir_C.7: 
The IAI Kfir entered service in 1975, but it was soon relegated to second line service after being replaced by more modern F-15s and F-16s in very few years. The C.7 variant was the third and most advanced of the Kfir. The aircraft featured larger canards in the front of the wings and carried a stronger version of the J79 engine that could help it take off with a heavier payload. Compared to previous variants it also fitted more hardpoints for missiles or ground ordnance, like bombs or gun pods. Despite being an air superiority fighter, it only scored a single aerial kill, due to being overshadowed by 4th generation fighters, this kill occurred in 1993 during Operation Accountability, after which it was gradually removed from service. However, an export version was sold to Colombia, Ecuador and Sri Lanka. After that, it saw service in the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983-2009) after being introduced in 1996.
