History of Mystere_IVA_(Israel): 
The Mystere IVA is a single seat fighter-bomber developed by France in the 1950s. The IAF operated a total of 61 units that were used in large scale combat during the Suez Crisis and the 1967 Six-Day War. The Mystere IVA was operated by the 101, 109, and 116 squadrons.
