History of Kurnass_2000: 
The Kurnass 2000 was an Israeli program intended to extend the service life of the existing F-4s in the IDF Air Force. A major part of the program was to improve the avionics and the aging airframes. New displays, cameras, and computers were implemented during the program, greatly enhancing its capabilities over a standard F-4E. In addition, fuel tank leaks were fixed and parts of the airframe were reinforced. F-4Es were also to be upgraded with the APG-76 radar over the standard APQ-120 radar. The Kurnass 2000 also received the ASX-1 TISEO targeting system which allowed Raphael Popeye ASMs to be launched.
