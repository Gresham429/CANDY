History of M.D.450B_Ouragan_(Israel): 
During the mid-1950s, Israel was keen to procure new fighter jets as tensions were rising between Israel's Arab neighbors. Israel looked at multiple jets such as the F-86 and F-84 but those deals fell through due to Arab involvement. France was the only country willing to sell jets to Israel, so Israel made a deal with France to acquire multiple Mystere IIs and 15 Mystere IVAs in July of 1954. However, this deal fell through due to performance issues with the Mystere II and problems with the Mystere IVA delayed transfers to the IAF. Israel acquired 12 M.D. 450 Ouragans as a stop-gap until the Mystere IVA was ready.
