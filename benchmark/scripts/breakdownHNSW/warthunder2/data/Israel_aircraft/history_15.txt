History of Ayit: 
In the years between 1972 and 1976, Israel received 117 upgraded A-4Ms called the A-4N. The A-4N ("Ayit" which means eagle) received many updated avionics over the standard A-4M while retaining the J52-P-408 engine. These updates included new computers, a heads-up display, a mapping, and range radar (AN/APQ-145), ECM homing and warning receiver (AN/APR-36/37), and more. The A-4N also received 2 DEFA 30 mm cannons, unlike the A-4M which had 2 20 millimeter cannons. In addition, the cockpit was revised for better visibility.
