Description of Vautour_IIA_(Israel): 
The Vautour IIA was a jet-powered attack aircraft designed by France during the 1950s. It was operated by Israel alongside the IIN variant. Armed with cannons and rockets, it was used in aerial reconnaissance duties but had the capabilities to perform Close Air Support missions thanks to its large amount of anti-ground ordnance.
