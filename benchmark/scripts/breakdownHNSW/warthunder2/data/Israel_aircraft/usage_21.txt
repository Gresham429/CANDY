Usage of Kfir_C.7: 
The Kfir C.7 is one of the fastest accelerating and best climbing planes in the game, its performance at >1,234 km/h and high altitude is particularly exceptional, on top of being highly manoeuvrable, though the plane will compress when going above Mach 1. This does help the Kfir maintain energy, but once it falls out of that compressed state it will pull, and pull hard. With the speed and acceleration advantage the Kfir offers, it suffers from its own success as the wings will rip at 1,460 km/h which can easily be exceeded with the Kfir if speed isn't being kept in check.
