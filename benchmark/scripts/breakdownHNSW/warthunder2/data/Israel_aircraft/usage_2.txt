Usage of Spitfire_Mk.IX_(CW)_(Israel): 
The Spitfire plays in a very aggressive role in most situations. While it is not the fastest or the highest in the match, it has the capabilities to win dogfights against most opponents. Common things to avoid are being stuck with less than 300 km/h since this fighter is especially sluggish at low speeds and always having an altitude advantage in most fights.
