History of Sa%27ar: 
The Sa'ar was a further development of the Super Mystere B2 Sambad by Israel. Its development can be traced back to 1967 when it was proposed to use the Pratt & Whitney J52-P-8A engine in Super Mysteres because of their unreliable engine. The engine used in the Super Mystere, was the Atar 101G-3. This engine had an afterburner and allowed the Super Mystere to reach supersonic speeds. However this came at the cost of reliability, elevated fuel consumption and frequent mechanical issues, not to mention that it was a very heavy engine, and when not using the afterburner it was also very weak. The upgrade was also motivated by the French embargo imposed over Israel in 1967, this embargo affected the acquiring of parts and other equipment needed to maintain the Atar 101G-3 engine.
