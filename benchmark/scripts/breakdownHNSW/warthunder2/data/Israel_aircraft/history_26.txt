History of Netz: 
By the end of the 1970s, Israel had established itself as the dominant air force in the Levant, having achieved technological superiority over the Soviet-equipped Syrian army - the only adjacent threat remaining after the signing of the peace deal with Egypt. This was mainly thanks to the purchase of F-15s into the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in 1976, which provided both a defensive and offensive umbrella that could not be challenged effectively by the Syrians. Nevertheless, the IAF still had two critical issues with the F-15: its prohibitive cost, and its relative unsuitability for low-altitude bombing, interdiction, and dogfighting. As the pressure mounted to replace the ageing F-4E Phantom II, Nesher and Kfir C.7, the IAF finally decided to purchase General Dynamics's new F-16 multi-role jet.
