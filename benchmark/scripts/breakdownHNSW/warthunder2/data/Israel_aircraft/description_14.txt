Description of A-4E_Early_(M)_(Israel): 
The A-4E Early (A4D-5) was part of the revision that improved the previous Skyhawk variants. It featured the J52-P-6A engine, which had better fuel consumption while also providing much more thrust. Other improvements included more hardpoints and new computers for navigation, bomb dropping, and more. The A-4E also marked the beginning of the new naming system for the Skyhawk. The "Early" versions of the A-4E lack the iconic "humpback" behind the cockpit, which houses more electronics. It also lacks the improved J52-P-8 engine. During the Yom Kippur War, Israel was losing Skyhawks at an astonishing rate, which led to 25+ A-4E Skyhawks being transferred over.
