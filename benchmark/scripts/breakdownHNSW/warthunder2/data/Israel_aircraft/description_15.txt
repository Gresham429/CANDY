Description of Ayit: 
In the 1980s, Israel set out to upgrade their A-4 Skyhawk fleet and modernize it. The upgrade package chosen would allow their A-4s to reach a level of equivelance to the US Marine Corps A-4M models. The resulting variant, called the A-4N "Ayit" included the integration of the Elbit ACE-1 HUD, Elbit computers, and the installation of an Elta EL/M-2032 radar, significantly enhancing its air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities. The A-4N Ayit could carry advanced munitions like the later variants of the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AGM-65 Maverick missiles, making it a potent platform for precision strike missions. IAI (Israel Aircraft Industries) conducted these upgrades, transforming the aging A-4 into a highly capable and modern combat aircraft, which served the IAF until its retirement in the early 2000s. The A-4N Ayit remains a testament to Israel's expertise in aircraft modernization and adaptation.
