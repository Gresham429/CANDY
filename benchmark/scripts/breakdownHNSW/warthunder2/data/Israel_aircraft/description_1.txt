Description of Spitfire_Mk_IXc_(Israel): 
Since the IAF lacked any kind of organized military after it's independence, the Air Force intended to acquire any aircraft available in the market. While sanctions were placed over Israel for weapon sales, the IAF managed to acquire around 50 Spitfires from Czechoslovakia in 1948 at a cost of 23.000$ (of the time) per unit. The aircraft was deemed much superior to the S-199 Sakeen acquired also from Czechoslovakia and was very well liked by Israeli pilots, it suffered some minor modifications, and variants with clipped wings were also sold to Israel or modified after being acquired. It was mainly used as an interceptor and air superiority fighter, while the P-51s were used in close air support and long range missions thanks to their increased fuel capacity and longer range.
