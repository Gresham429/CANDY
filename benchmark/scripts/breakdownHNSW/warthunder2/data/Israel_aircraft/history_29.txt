History of Barak_II: 
In the late 1970s, Israel began its ambitious project to produce its first locally-manufactured jet fighter, meant to replace the aging IAI Kfir. Learning from their previous work on the Mirage and Kfir programs, and borrowing ideas from America's then-new F-16A fighter jet (which had entered IAF service in 1980 as the "Netz"), Israeli aeronautic engineers were able to develop a highly-manoeuvrable, delta-wing, single-seat fighter of their own - the IAI Lavi.
