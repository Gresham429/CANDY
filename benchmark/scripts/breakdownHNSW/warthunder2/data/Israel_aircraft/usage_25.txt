Usage of Kfir_Canard: 
The Kfir Canard, like all other Kfirs in the Israeli tech tree, possesses a uniquely powerful motor relative to its size and weight, decent guns (when the Air targets belt is selected), mediocre if not situationally-acceptable missiles, and an ability to make sharp angular manoeuvres in a split second.
