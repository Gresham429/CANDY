Description of Kurnass: 
The Kurnass (Heavy Hammer) is the Israeli variant of the F-4 Phantom. After the Six-Day War and other political situations, the US sent F-4 Phantoms to Israel under the authorization of President John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson. After arrival, crew training quickly began and the Kurnasses were soon in action against Egypt in the War of Attrition. After the war, more F-4Es were delivered under various programs like Peace Echo II. The Kurnasses were the main frontline fighter, but after the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15 Eagle came into service, the F-4 was relegated to air-to-ground duties. Many Kurnasses would later be converted to the Kurnass 2000 standard, which had new electronics and other improvements.
