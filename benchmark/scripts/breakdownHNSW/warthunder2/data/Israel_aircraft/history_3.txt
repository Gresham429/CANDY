History of Sakeen: 
At its inception, the Israeli Air Force sought any fighter aircraft it could acquire to supplement its fledgeling military. Unfortunately for the IAF, there were strict arms embargoes put in place on Israel which made it challenging. The IAF's purchasing agents then set out and approached aircraft manufacturers across Europe to find one who might be able to provide fighters.
