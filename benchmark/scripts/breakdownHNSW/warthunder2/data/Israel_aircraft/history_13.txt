History of A-4H_(Israel): 
In the early 1960s, Israel was keen to purchase Skyhawks from the U.S. either from surplus inventory or new planes being built for sale specifically to Israel. At first, the U.S. rejected Israel's request for A-4s in an effort to remain neutral to the Arab world. However, a few years later, the U.S. changed its mind and allowed Israel to purchase Skyhawks. Israel sent out an order of 48 A-4H Skyhawks. The A-4H was an A-4E but with a better engine (J52-P-8A), modified vertical stabilizer with an IFF (AN/APX-46), a drag chute, and didn't have the "humpback" which housed avionics. The A-4Hs arrived in Israel in late 1967 and the Israelis replaced the 20-millimeter cannons with DEFA 30-millimeter cannons.
