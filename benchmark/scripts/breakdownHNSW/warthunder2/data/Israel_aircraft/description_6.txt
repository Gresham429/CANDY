Description of Spitfire_LF_Mk.IXe_Weizman%27s_(Israel): 
The Spitfire got into Israeli hands during the 1948 War of Independence and by the end of the war, most of the IAF's fighters were Spitfires of different models. The Black Spitfire (originally No. 2057) arrived in Israel in 1949 after the war. It served with the 101 in the same way as other Spitfires: reconnaissance and escort missions. When most Spitfires were sold to Burma in 1954, Ezer Weizman, then commander of the Ramat David air force base and future President of Israel, argued in favour of keeping some units in Israel. The Spitfire was painted black with the number 57. Even though it was supposed to be used for training purposes, many considered the aircraft to be personally owned by Ezer Weizman and the plane was flown in numerous parades in Israel, becoming known as "Weizman's Black Spit".
