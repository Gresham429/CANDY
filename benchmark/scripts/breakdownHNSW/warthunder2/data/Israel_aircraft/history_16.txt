History of Vautour_IIA_(Israel): 
The Vautour IIA was a jet bomber ordered by the French Army as a jet bomber with low level attack and the ability to operate in all weather. France and Israel worked together on defense, such as on nuclear, aviation, and research for armaments. Israel was motivated to buy the Vautour to counteract the Egyptian IL-28, purchased from the Soviet Union. A total of 30 IIAs were produced, with 25 going to Israel.[1]
