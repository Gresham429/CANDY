Description of A-4H_(Israel): 
In 1963, Israel proposed an idea to acquire US Navy surplus Skyhawks or have a special one made for Israel. At the time the proposal was rejected as an attempt for America to remain neutral but that changed three years later. The US planned to make a new variant for Israel called the A-4H. The A-4H was intended to be the regular A-4E but better suited for land-based operations. It was powered by the J52-P-8A, the same engine found in the humpback A-4Es. The A-4H would also be fitted with two 30 mm DEFA cannons rather than the standard armament of 20 mm cannons. Israel received around 90 A-4Hs until they were replaced by the vastly superior F-16 Fighting Falcon.
