Description of P-51D-20-NA_(Israel): 
The P-51D was acquired by Israel in 1948 by secret agents trying to smuggle aircraft into Israel bypassing the US embargo. Some units managed to be sent to Israel and were crucial in the Independence War. These P-51s were the backbone of the IAF, thanks to its long range and multirole capabilities. They were used in escort, reconnaissance, patrol, and close air support missions, finally being retired from duty in 1961.
