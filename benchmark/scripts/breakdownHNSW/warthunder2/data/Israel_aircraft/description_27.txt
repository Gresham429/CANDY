Description of Kurnass_2000: 
The F-4E Kurnass 2000 was an upgrade package for the F-4E Phantom II by the IAF. The upgrade focused on the aircraft armament and electronic systems. While upgrades to the power plant were proposed, with the introduction of more powerful engines, this modification was not installed to reduce costs. The Kurnass 2000 received a new radar, the AN/APG-76, that was far more superior than the AN/APG-120 used by the standard F-4E. It also was equipped with the ASX-1 TISEO targeting system which allowed Raphael Popeye ASMs to be launched. More advanced avionics and targeting systems for anti-tank munitions and guided bombs were installed, as well as the ability to carry the AIM-9L and Python 3 missile.
