History of F-84F_(Israel): 
In 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made plans to construct a dam across the river Nile at Aswan - a massive project that could radically change the Egyptian economy and solve many dire problems he had been facing. However, the World Bank refused his request for a loan, without which the project could not proceed. In retaliation, Nasser declared his country's sovereignty over the Suez Canal - the artificial waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea - which until that point had been co-owned by the UK government and the French public. While Egypt's army moved to take the canal from its European civilian operators, Egyptian naval forces moved to block the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Red Sea to prevent any Israeli ships from entering it. This move marked the beginning of an event known today as the "1956 Suez Crisis".
