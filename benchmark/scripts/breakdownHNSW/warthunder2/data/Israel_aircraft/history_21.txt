History of Kfir_C.7: 
In the 1960s, French and Israeli engineers worked together to develop the Dassault Mirage 5, successor to the Mirage III, tailored specifically to the requirements of the Israeli Air Force (IAF). Israel funded a large part of the project by purchasing a total of 50 aircraft in advance of their production. The deal eventually fell through when France enacted an arms embargo on Israel following its preemptive strike at the start of the 1967 Six-Day War - an action that the French had explicitly warned Israel not to take. Though Israel was eventually reimbursed for its payments, the Mirage 5 was never supplied.
