Description of A-4E_(Israel): 
The A-4E was a major upgrade in the A-4 family. It improved avionics, navigation equipment, fitted a more powerful engine and even gave the aircraft the capability to carry more ordnance with the introduction of a total of six pylons. Israel were the largest export customer of the A-4, including 46 A-4Es supplied by the USA as replacements for lost Ayits during the Yom Kippur War. The A-4s were upgraded on several occasions, and were finally retired from Israeli frontline duty in 2008 and from training purposes in 2015.
