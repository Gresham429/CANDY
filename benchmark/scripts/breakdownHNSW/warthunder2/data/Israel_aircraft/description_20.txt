Description of Shahak: 
The Shahak was the name given by the IAF personal to the French Mirage IIICJ in service. It was Israel first Mach 2 capable fighter and it was it's main air superiority fighter for many years. It participated in the Six Days War and Yom Kippur War, as well as several border conflicts and skirmishes with Egyptian and Syrian forces, it's main enemy was the Soviet made MiG-21 interceptor. For it's pilots the new missiles carried by the Shahak proved to be too unreliable and most pilots would rather use the DEFA cannons equipped in the aircraft. Israel operated a total of 72 Mirage III fighters that were phased out soon after the Yom Kippur War in favour of more modern IAI Kfir and F-4 Phantom IIs
