Description of Sambad: 
During the 1956 Suez Crisis, Israel realised a need for a new, long-range, high-endurance jet fighter. Thus, with close ties to France, they placed an order for 24 Super Mystere B2s (called Sambad in Israel) in 1958. These planes were involved in the Six-Day War in which it saw extensive use. The aircraft were also involved in the USS Liberty incident where 2 Sambads released their napalm bombs on the USS Liberty. The Sambad also saw use in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, during which 6 were shot down. It served well as the first supersonic fighter in IAF service.
