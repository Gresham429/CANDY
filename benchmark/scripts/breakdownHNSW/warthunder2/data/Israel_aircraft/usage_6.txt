Usage of Spitfire_LF_Mk.IXe_Weizman%27s_(Israel): 
This plane is a formidable opponent when going against it. It has an astounding climb rate with a decent armament and still maintains that superb turn time that spitfires are known for. Because it is a low altitude variant, it is wise to stay below 5,000 m to get the best performance possible. Remember to use your supercharger when above 2,000 m: it will grant you a significant performance increase. Climbing is a valid strategy when you first spawn in because of your amazing climb rate. You are nearly guaranteed a height advantage over everyone. Maintain your altitude and lure enemies into a turn fight as there isn't anyone at your battle rating that can outturn you, the exception being a couple Japanese planes. Although this plane is a good turnfighter, exploiting your turn rate too much can lead to bleed a lot of energy and become an easy target for other planes. This plane is reasonably fast but for sure not the fastest at its rating. Do not head on with this plane. The 20 mm Hispano cannons are inaccurate, and jam quickly, even when fully upgraded. Instead, dodge and start a turn fight where the Spitfire will almost always come out on top.
