Description of Meteor_NF.13_(Israel): 
The Meteor NF.13 reached Israel when Britain offered the sale of Gloster Meteors to all nations in the Middle East with the intentions of gaining sales while remaining neutral. The IAF, needing to improve their night-fighting capabilities, applied for an offer of Meteor NF.13s made by Britain to Syria and Egypt. As such, 6 aircraft were ordered in 1956. The 119th squadron would be formed with the intentions of using these new Meteors. Three would be delivered in the same year, however the other 3 aircraft would only be delivered in 1958.
