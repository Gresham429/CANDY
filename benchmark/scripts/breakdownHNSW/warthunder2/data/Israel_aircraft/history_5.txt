History of B-17G_(Israel): 
The B-17G was the final combat model of the B-17 Flying Fortress. Produced from late 1943 until several months after the end of World War II, this variant included all successful improvements made to previous B-17 models. It carried a total of 13 machine guns for point-defense, including the new remote-controlled chin turret that greatly improved the B-17's ability to defend against head-on attacks. By the end of the B-17G's production run, a total of 8,680 units were manufactured - just over 2/3 of the total number of B-17s that had ever been built. The B-17G was instrumental in long-range daytime bombing over Nazi-occupied Europe, flying in massive formations often dozens or even hundreds of planes strong.
