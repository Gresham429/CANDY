History of Sambad: 
The Super Mystere B2 Sambad was operated by the IAF after an order for 24 aircraft was placed in 1958. Operated mainly as a single seat bomber, it was the IAF's first supersonic afterburning fighter and was used as its first-line plane from 1958-1962. The plane first entered service with the 105 Squadron at Hazor AFB. Some encounters during small border skirmishes between the MiG-17 and the Sambad occurred in the late 1950s to early 1960s with no clear superior fighter at the end.
