Description of Sakeen: 
The S-199 "Sakeen" is a modified Bf 109 produced by the Czech firm Avia as the S-199 model. Avia used to produce Bf 109s for Germany, but after the war the lack of fighter engines forced them to produce their own Bf 109 variant using the Junkers Jumo 211F engine, an engine made for use in the Heinkel He 111 heavy bomber. Israel bought 25 S-199s in 1947, which arrived at the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The aircraft was known to lack reliability, with engine problems, constant jamming of the guns, and even instances where the guns destroyed the propeller of the plane. However despite its problems, it proved successful in the early days of the war, shooting down several Egyptian aircraft over Israeli territory.
