Description of Kfir_C.2: 
Based on the Nesher, the Kfir (translates to "Lion Cub") was an Israeli program to improve their existing Mirage fleet with new avionics and the General Electric J79 engine from the F-4 Phantom II. Compared to the original French SNECMA Atar 9C engine in the Nesher, the J79 engine was shorter and had higher requirements for air flow and operating temperatures, so the modified aircraft holding the J79 had their rear ends redesigned for the shorter engine, with air intakes added or enlarged to accommodate the engine temperatures. The first prototype, under the name Ra'am (for "Thunder") flew on June 4, 1973, and the prototype would be accepted into Israeli Air Force service on April 14, 1975, in the 101 "First Fighter" Squadron as the Kfir C.1. The Kfir C.2 variant was the second production model after complaints that the C.1 had inferior maneuverability compared to the Shahak, which saw the addition of canard (larger than that found on the Kfir Canard), leading edges on the wing, and small strakes on the nose.
