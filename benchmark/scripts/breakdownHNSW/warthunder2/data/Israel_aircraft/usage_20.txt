Usage of Shahak: 
In Air RB, it is recommended to climb and use your decent radar and Matra R530 SARH missiles against unsuspecting aircraft (such as Harriers, A-5C, F-5C, MiG-21S and more). The R530 missile has pretty good range and can hit opponents coming head-on even when launched from the maximum range (~12 km or 7.5 mi at ~5 km or ~3 mi altitude or more) while also being agile enough to hit targets that try to manoeuvre at higher altitudes.
