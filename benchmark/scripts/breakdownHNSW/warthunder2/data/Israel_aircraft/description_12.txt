Description of Sa%27ar: 
The Sa'ar was a later development of the Sambad (Super Mystere B2). The reason for its development was the weak, fuel-hungry engine of the Super Mystere, the Atar 101G-3 engine. Not only that, but it was also prone to mechanical failures. In 1967, it was proposed to use the engine of the A-4H in the Super Mystere. The Pratt & Whitney J52-P-8A engine was lighter, 25% more powerful, more reliable, and less fuel-hungry, but it had no afterburner. The new aircraft featured more ground ordnance capabilities, Shafrir 2 missiles, and a better range, at the cost of no longer being considered an interceptor due to the loss of its afterburner. By 1973, the upgrade program was completed, and all 26 Super Mysteres in the IAF were upgraded to the Sa'ar model.
