History of Spitfire_LF_Mk.IXe_Weizman%27s_(Israel): 
Shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel, its new Defense Ministry began work on the formation of a more organised air force as a branch of the new Israel Defense Force. The first planes purchased were Czechoslovakian Avia S-199s - a partially-improvised version of the Bf 109 - but these proved to be inferior to Egyptian Air Force Spitfires. Simultaneously, Israel began acquiring its own Spitfires (primarily surplus planes previously given to Czechoslovakia by Britain) in a series of politically - and functionally - complex operations. By the end of the war, most combat aircraft in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) were Spitfires of whatever models could be acquired.
