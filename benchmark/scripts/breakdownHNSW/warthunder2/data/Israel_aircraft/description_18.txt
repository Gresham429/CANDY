Description of F-84F_(Israel): 
The first F-84s operating under the command of the Israeli Air Force flew during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Three French air squadrons were deployed to Israel in order to help in the invasion of the Suez peninsula, but these aircrafts were painted with IAF colours in order to mask French involvement in the war. After seeing the good potential of the F-84 in the war, the IAF ordered 50 F-84F-70-RE before the end of 1956. This planes stayed grounded due to corrosion issues that plagued all F-84s around the world. However this aircrafts would serve with excellent results in the 1967 Six Day War and would continue to serve until 1972.
