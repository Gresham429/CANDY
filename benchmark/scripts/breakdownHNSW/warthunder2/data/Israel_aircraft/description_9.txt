Description of M.D.450B_Ouragan_(Israel): 
With tensions rising in the Arab world, Israel was looking for a new, advanced fighter. After multiple failed deals with the F-86 and F-84, France took the initiative to sell their jets. At first, Israel was set on receiving the new Mystere IV and Mystere II but testing revealed numerous issues with the Mysteres. They were to be grounded until the problems were remedied. As a stop-gap measure, France sent 12 M.D.450 Ouragans to Israel. Although Israel soon received the Mystere IV, they still continued to successfully use the Ouragan as a support fighter and ground striker. Ouragans served well into the 1970s until they were replaced by more superior aircraft; some being sold to El Salvador.
