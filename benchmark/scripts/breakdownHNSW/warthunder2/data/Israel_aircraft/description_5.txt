Description of B-17G_(Israel): 
By 1948, B-17s were no longer in service with the USAF as bombers. And since the IAF was desperate to acquire any combat-worthy aircraft, they got their hands on 3 privately owned, unarmed units that were flown to Czechoslovakia and armed with 7.62 mm MGs, makeshift bomb sights and German bomb racks. The planes bombed several targets during their journey to Israel, and during the entire Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the 3 planes flew 200 sorties. After being used as radio transceivers during the Sinai War of 1956, they were finally fully decommissioned in 1958.
