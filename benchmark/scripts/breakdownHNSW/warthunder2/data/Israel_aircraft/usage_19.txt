Usage of A-4E_(Israel): 
Ground attack - With its large payload options and capability, the A-4E is very capable at ground attack or base bombing. The AGM-62A Walleye bombs have a tremendous advantage of stand-off bombing, while you only get roughly 2,000 lbs of explosives in the loadout, dropping from high altitudes (24+ km / 8,000+ ft) at a speed nearing Mach 0.8 can have the AGM-62A with some practice traveling beyond 8 km (5 mi) to a target. The 30 mm DEFA cannons are phenomenal in accuracy, ammo count, and stopping power. However, with the plane being nose heavy, your angle of attack is extremely high at low speeds, which can lead to slam into the ground when trying to strafe ground targets with guns.
