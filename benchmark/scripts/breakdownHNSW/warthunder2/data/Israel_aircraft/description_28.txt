Description of Baz: 
In the late 1970s, under the Peace Fox I program, Israel recieved its first shipment of the latest F-15A Eagle air superiority fighters, and shortly after, the second shipment was temporarily embargo'd as a result of the 1982 Lebanon War. However, that did not matter to the Israelis, as even a single F-15 was a landslide advantage in the air wars of the Middle East, making short work of 30 year old Syrian MiG-21s that tried to face it. The Israeli F-15A, nicknamed the Baz ("Falcon") would score the premiere kill for the F-15 in aerial combat, against a Syrian MiG-21, in 1978, and would start the totem pole of air dominance that defines the F-15's service record. Of the 103+ confirmed aerial kills the F-15 has scored during its service life, Israeli F-15s are responsible for over 80 of them, and the Baz is the concrete starting ground for this long lasting legacy.
