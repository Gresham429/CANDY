Usage of Barak_II: 
The Barak II provides a good platform for either committing to attacking other planes, destroying ground targets in GRB with the diverse payload options, or a mixture of both. A large amount of flares/chaff helps prolong the time the Barak II can spend in battle. Players must however keep in mind that the engine burns fuel very quickly when left on afterburner.
