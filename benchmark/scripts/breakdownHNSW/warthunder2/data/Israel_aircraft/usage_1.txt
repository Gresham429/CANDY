Usage of Spitfire_Mk_IXc_(Israel): 
The most common and dangerous opponents will be Bf 109s and P-51s due to their superior speed and acceleration especially at altitudes above 5 km when the Spitfire loses significant engine power. A better alternative is fighting at around 3-4 km, however, at this BR fighters like the Fw 190 and P-47s will outrun you but not outturn the Spitfire. However, your good climb rate means that getting to 4 km is faster compared to other planes like the ones mentioned earlier.
