Usage of Sakeen: 
The Sakeen has awful energy retention meaning that the aircraft is not effective at turnfighting. It also lacks manoeuvrability and has a poor climb rate. In Realistic Battles, the fighter should be used as a support role. The Sakeen is effective at boom-and-zooming and is able to knock out an enemy aircraft quickly with a few bursts.
