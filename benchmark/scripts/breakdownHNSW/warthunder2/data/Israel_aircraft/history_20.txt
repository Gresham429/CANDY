History of Shahak: 
Shahak was the name given by the Israelis to their operated Dassault Mirage IIICJ. Israel placed an order for several aircrafts in 1959 to combat the new Mig-21 Mach 2 fighters fitted by many Arab nations. The Mirage fighters given to Israel had a couple of modifications, the Mirage was intended to be a high altitude bomber interceptor but Israel needed a fighter jet capable of air superiority missions.
