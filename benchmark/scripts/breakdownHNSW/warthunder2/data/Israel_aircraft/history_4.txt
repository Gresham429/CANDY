History of P-51D-20-NA_(Israel): 
In the summer of 1948, Israeli agents looking to acquire aircraft for the newly founded Israeli Air Forces smuggled four P-51s into Israel to bypass the United States Arms Embargo, in crates labelled "Agricultural Equipment". The first two, No. 190 and 191, arrived in September of 1948, entering Israel's first fighter squadron. They served in Herzliya and Castina (Hazor) during the War of Independence in 1948. The planes dominated the skies, due to its long range that could reach across the entire Middle East, as well as better performance than the aircraft of the Arab side.
