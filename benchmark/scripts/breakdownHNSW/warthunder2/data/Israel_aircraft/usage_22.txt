Usage of Kurnass: 
The ÔÅôF-4E Phantom II is well-suited for most in-game situations. For attacking ground targets, the plane is armed with an assortment of bombs, rockets, and missiles. Against air targets, players may employ the vehicle's deadly air-to-air missiles and frontal cannons. Three externally-mounted gunpods may be equipped. Although they will undoubtedly increase the vehicle's destructive capabilities, they also appreciably hinder flight performance through induced drag. In many situations, one front-facing cannon is all that is required to dispatch an opponent aircraft. As for the missiles, the ones used by this plane are average at its rank, comparable to the R-60 missiles equipped by the MiG-21MF (Germany) and the MiG-21SMT (albeit with worse manoeuvrability). The AIM-9G missiles are most effective when fired from between 2 to 4 km away from the target. Any closer will make it harder for the missile to hit the target and the end result could be a miss. At higher altitudes the AIM-7E-2 missiles can ensure better results when shot from 4 - 6 km range as they are almost impossible to dodge at these heights.
