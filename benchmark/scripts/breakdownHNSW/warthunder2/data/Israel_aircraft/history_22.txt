History of Kurnass: 
Israel was a prominent user of the F-4 Phantom II, having acquired its Phantoms starting in 1968. At first, the USA was unwilling to offer Israel the F-4, but developments in 1967-1968 led the USA to reconsider its position. Notably, a French embargo of Israeli aircraft and the defection of a Soviet MiG-21 convinced the USA to sell its F-4Es to Israel. The first of these aircraft arrived in January of 1968, nicknamed Kurnass (Heavy Hammer) in service.
