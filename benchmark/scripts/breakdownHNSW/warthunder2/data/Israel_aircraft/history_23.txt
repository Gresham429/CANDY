History of Nesher: 
During the first two decades of its existence, the State of Israel developed a close technological alliance with the Republic of France. The primary expression of this alliance was the large-scale export of military aircraft from France to Israel, including the Ouragan, Vautour and Mystere. By 1965, France had helped turn the Israeli Air Force (IAF) from an improvised World War II-era operation into one of the most formidable, high-tech, jet-equipped air forces in the world. This cooperation reached its zenith in the early 1960s with the adoption of the Mirage III as Israel's primary fighter jet.
