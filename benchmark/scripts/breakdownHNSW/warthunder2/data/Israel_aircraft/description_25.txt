Description of Kfir_Canard: 
The Kfir Canard, also known as the Kfir Gderot ("Fenced Kfir"), was an intermediate improvement of the initial IAI Kfir (Lion Cub). After the domestic production of Nesher (Mirage 5) by IAI, there were further plans to upgrade Nesher's underpowered engine with a GE J79 engine with much higher thrust, as well as some aerodynamic changes to fit the engine and for better overall capabilities. The new Kfir made its maiden flight in 1973 and soon joined IAF by the next year as one of the frontline fighters of the IAF against neighbouring Arabic countries. However, pilots often complained about the poor manoeuvrability of the aircraft compared to the Mirage III, and thus the aircraft were retrofitted with short canards on the air intakes, creating the Kfir Gderot variant. Alongside their service in Israeli forces, mainly as ground attackers, these aircraft were also rented by the USN and USMC (redesignated F-21A) as their aggressor squadron's jet to simulate combat against MiG-23s.
