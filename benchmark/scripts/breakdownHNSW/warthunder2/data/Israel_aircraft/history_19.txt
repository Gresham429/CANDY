History of A-4E_(Israel): 
Israel had been interested in purchasing American combat planes ever since its inception in 1948, but rocky relations with the US resulted in the Americans refusing the vast majority of proposals over several decades. 1965 saw the first approval of a major deal for American combat jets, in which Israel would (initially) receive 48 A-4H Skyhawks. Due to lingering American reluctance to sell high-end military equipment to Israel at the time, the A-4H was actually a stripped-down variant of the A-4F (itself an improvement of the A-4E), removing several key abilities from the aircraft: It had no ability to fire AAMs, had a downgraded bombing sight, and could only carry a limited variety of air-to-ground weaponry.
