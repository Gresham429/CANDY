History of Kfir_Canard: 
In the mid-1960s, as the requirements of Israel Air Force for a dedicated cost-reduction variant of Mirage III arose, Dassault Aviation designed Mirage 5 for their needs on defense against neighbouring countries. But after the complications of the late-1960s, Israeli also managed to built their own version of Mirage 5 known as the Nesher ("vulture") and they were built from September 1969 until 1974.
