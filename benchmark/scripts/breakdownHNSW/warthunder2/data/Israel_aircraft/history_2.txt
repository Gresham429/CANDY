History of Spitfire_Mk.IX_(CW)_(Israel): 
During late WW2, the Clipped Wing design was a common upgrade for the Mk IX and Mk XVI variants of the Spitfire. According to test flights by the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford using the Spitfire Mk V, this configuration offered better speeds at altitudes below 10,000 ft and slightly better speeds around 25,000 ft. However it provided much better acceleration and agility overall. For pilots, this modification also meant a better view around the aircraft, because sometimes the large and wide wings of the Spitfire blocked incoming fighters or obstructed the pilot's vision during ground attacks.
