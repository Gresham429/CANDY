Usage of P40_%22G.C._Leoncello%22: 
The P40 can be played like other medium tanks like the Panzer IV in that the mobility should be used to try and get a position of opportunity against the enemy. Though the 75 mm APCBC is generally inadequate in a frontal engagement, the usage of the HEAT round could level the disparity in armour and firepower. As a support, stick together with allies during an assault or defence of a base. The P40 is still a vital piece as a team player and can attract the enemy's attention either as an easy target or a threat with the 75 mm gun. Allow the enemy tanks to try and take attention of the P40 or another ally and while the lone enemy is targeting one, the others move in to hit the enemy. Coordinate effectively to control choke points against the enemy movements.
