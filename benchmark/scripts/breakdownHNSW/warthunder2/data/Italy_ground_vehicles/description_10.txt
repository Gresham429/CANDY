Description of 47/32_L40: 
The Fiat-Ansaldo Semovente L. 40 da 47/32 was an Italian self-propelled gun built during World War II. A 47 mm Cannone da 47/32 tank cannon was mounted in an open-topped, box-like superstructure on the chassis of an L6/40 light tank. Some were designed as command tanks, with a radio replacing the main tank gun. Between 1941 and 1945, approximately 400 units were built. It was the most heavily armed Italian armoured fighting vehicle on the Eastern Front. While the 47 mm Cannone da 47/32 tank gun was adequate in 1941, by the time this self-propelled gun finished design and reached service, it had become obsolete and worthless against enemy medium tanks, hence the vehicle failed to perform well. The German Army acquired control of these vehicles after the Italian armistice in September 1943 and was redesignated as Sturmgeschutz L6 47/32 630(i). Some of these were sent to Germany's puppet state of Croatia and the Slovene Home Guard.
