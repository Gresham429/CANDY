History of Celere_Sahariano: 
After clashing with British armored forces in the desert of North Africa in the early 1940's, the Italian Army became impressed with the performance of the various cruiser tanks fielded by the British (e.g. the Crusader). As a result, the army issued an order to tank manufacturers to develop a new light vehicle whose mobility and firepower would outmatch that of the cruiser tanks.
