Usage of 75/34_M42: 
Thanks to its performant gun, the 75/34 M42 is effective as a tank destroyer at long range with the good penetration of its APCBC round. With a maximum penetration of 64 mm at 1,000 m, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the angled front armour of many similar rank vehicles from a distance. Light tanks, armoured cars and SPAA are the easiest targets. The vehicle's effectiveness improves once the HEAT shell is unlocked, with 100 mm of penetration at all ranges. This allows for reliable penetration of practically all the Semovente's potential adversaries. Your most dangerous opponents are fast and agile light tanks such as the M22 that can easily flank the Semovente undetected and disable you from close range. Their speed and small size make those light tanks difficult to target for the Semovente's gun.
