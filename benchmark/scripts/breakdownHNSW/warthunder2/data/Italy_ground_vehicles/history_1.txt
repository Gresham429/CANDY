History of AB_41: 
An advanced automotive design, with the similar AB 40 it gave the Italian Army a modern armoured car during the Second World War. The AB 41 had a 4x4 layout, with four-wheel steering and fully independent suspension. The freely rotating spare wheels, positioned midway along the sides of the hull, prevented the vehicle from bellying out when crossing obstacles. It also had a rear driver position. The AB 40 had 2 coaxial machine guns in the turret and a third rear-facing machine gun. The AB 41 had the 20 mm gun in place of one of the turret machine guns, and also had an increase in engine horsepower over the other design. In total 24 AB 40 and 560 AB 41s were built. They served in the reconnaissance units of armoured, motorized and cavalry divisions, as well as in independent recon companies and platoons, with 4 vehicles per platoon. The AB 40s only were used in North Africa, but AB 41s were active on all fronts, including 30 sent to Russia.
