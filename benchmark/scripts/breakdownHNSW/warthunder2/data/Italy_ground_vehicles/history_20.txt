History of P40: 
The Carro Pesante P26/40 was Italy's heaviest and most modern tank that saw service in the war. Despite only weighing 26 tonnes, which is significantly less than almost every other country's medium tanks, it was classed as a heavy tank due to Italy's tank design doctrine. In early 1940, the Italians started working on a 25 tonne "heavy" infantry support tank that was intended to fight alongside the "M" class medium tanks.[3] The recent Africa campaign showed the massive problems the Italian tanks in production had, namely a lack of armour and insufficient firepower, prompting the army to make some changes. The initial design of 1941 was based around the same scheme of the M13/40 medium tank and saw the use of a short barreled 75/18 howitzer in turret, two machineguns in the hull and the use of vertical armour plates. With the capture of one the early T-34/76, showed by the Germans, the P26/40 was completely revised with sloped plates and a longer 75/34 gun.[4] The vehicle was adopted in late 1942 and was named "P26/40", 26 for the weight and 40 for the year it was designed, later semplified in P40 following a new denomination policy after august 1942.[5] While surely better than previous italian tanks, the P40 was only comparable to mid-war allied and soviet medium tanks, such as M4s, Cromwells or T-34/76s, but was still outdated regarding its mobility, the riveted armour and the use of a smaller two-men turret.[6][7] The Italian Army considered the use of heavier, but never realized, P43 and P43 bis or the license production of the german Panther even before the service of the P26/40.[8]
