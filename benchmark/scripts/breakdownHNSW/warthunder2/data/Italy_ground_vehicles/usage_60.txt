Usage of R3_T106_FA: 
Similar to most other light tanks, the best way to play this vehicle is either as an ambush vehicle or as a flanking vehicle. This helps to avoid direct confrontations which in turn masks the vehicle's greatest weaknesses which are poor fire stability (gun bounce) and poor armour. This also capitalises on its main advantage which is its insane speed. Ambushing even in highly popular pathways can be very successful with this tank due to its presence of 2 guns, reducing the chance you will be overwhelmed. Brawling can be done in this vehicle due to its fast acceleration, allowing it to duck in and out of cover to fire very quickly.
