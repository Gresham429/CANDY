Description of L3/33_CC: 
The Carro Veloce, also known as the L3/33, was designed and produced by Ansaldo for the Regio Esercito beginning in 1933. It swiftly became one of the most utilized platforms due to its unique features that made it a very useful vehicle for the Italian terrain. It was a compact, light design with decent mobility. Its main drawback was the lack of armour, even heavier calibre machine guns could pose a serious threat to the crew inside. However, due to how easy it was to produce that drawback was not too important, it swiftly saw combat in many war theatres Italy was present in, such as in Yugoslavia, Albania, and Greece. Several variants were produced, including a flamethrower variant (the L3/33 LF, standing for "LanciaFiamme"), and even a bridge carrier variant. The CC variant would primarily be armed with a 20 mm Fucile Controcarri S Mod.39 anti-tank gun, these were surprisingly effective during the pre-war and early war periods as heavily armoured threats weren't as prevalent. However, once heavier foes began to be deployed, the gun began to be used less for anti-tank duties and more for general fire support against the remaining light tanks, infantry and other support vehicles that may be spotted. This vehicle survived the end of the war and remained in service in limited numbers in the Italian post-war police force.
