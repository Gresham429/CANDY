History of FIAT_6614: 
The Fiat 6614 was an APC joint venture between Fiat and OTO Melara. Post-war Italy had realized the need of having light vehicles that could easily be deployed at long distances to further support the front-line troops, without actually being in the front-line. The Fiat 6614 was specifically made to fill in the requirements of the many military and para-military organizations, where some form of mobile armoured protection is required for personnel. The first prototype was made in 1972, which underwent many changes, both aesthetic and armament-wise. An example would be such as the Fiat 6614 having access to a dual .50 cal turret, which would be ultimately removed after testing. Fiat would be in charge of the engine and the automotive components while OTO Melara was in charge of the hull and weapon system. The Fiat 6614 would be outfitted with an IVECO 8062.24 diesel engine, this allowed the Fiat 6614 to reach speeds of 100 km/h. It had a max crew of 3, but being a APC, could carry up to 10 soldiers at once. One of its staple abilities was the fact that it could be amphibious (propulsion once in the water was provided by the road wheels), which further allowed it to push itself into it being a multi-role vehicle. There was plenty of optional equipment available for the Fiat 6614, such as: recovery winch, night vision equipment, smoke grenade discharges and also an air conditioning system. Armament-wise, due to its weight, it couldn't really support heavy loads (primarily also why the Fiat 6616 was made), this didn't stop it from having a few armaments installed, one of the more obscure variants being one with a FIROS-6 rocket launcher. It's good to note that it was also marketed as a mortar carrier, medi-vac ambulance and also a reconnaissance vehicle.
