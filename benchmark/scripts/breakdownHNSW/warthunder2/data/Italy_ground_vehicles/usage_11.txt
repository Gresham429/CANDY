Usage of Lancia_3Ro_(100/17): 
The best way to play the Lancia 3Ro (100/17) is to use it as a flanker and for surprise attacks. Due to the vehicle being wheeled, it is able to reach spots at the start of the match that many vehicles on the enemy team will not expect fire from. Good situational awareness and great map knowledge is needed to take full advantage of its mobility. Finding a good spot where it's not at risk of being cut down by MG fire will unlock the full potential of this vehicle.
