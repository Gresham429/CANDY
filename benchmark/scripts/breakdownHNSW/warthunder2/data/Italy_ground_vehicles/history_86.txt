History of VCC-80/30: 
After the VCC-80 "Dardo" program was finalized, OTO Melara also had many plans to export the machine, or parts of the machine, to foreign countries who might've been interested in acquiring Italian technology. The standard version of the VCC-80 'Dardo' IFV would itself be armed with a 25 mm Oerlikon autocannon, which would be installed onto the OTO TC-25 Hitfist turret, however during the '90s OTO had designed an upgrade kit for the TC-25 Hitfist turrets, which were primarily made as optional armament available for anyone interested in up-gunning the IFV from a 25 mm Oerlikon to a 30 mm Bushmaster.
