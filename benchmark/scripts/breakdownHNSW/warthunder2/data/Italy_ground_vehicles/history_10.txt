History of 47/32_L40: 
The Semovente (sometimes abbreviated "SMV") 47/32 was derived from the L6/40 light tank in order to act as a mobile version of Italy's standard anti-tank gun, the Boehler M1935 or Cannone da 47/32, also used in the M13/40 and M14/41 medium tanks. It was intended to act as a tank destroyer in dedicated battalions , but in practice was generally used instead as infantry support because its anti-tank performance was so mediocre. A squadron of nine was authorised for the RECo (Raggruppamento Esplorante Corazzato; armoured reconnaissance task force) of an armoured or motorised division. A four-vehicle element was also authorised for the NEC (Nucleo Esplorante Celere; fast recon group) of the 1943-type infantry division, at least on paper. From March of 1942 it saw action in Russia with the 13th Semoventi Battalion, part of the 3rd Celere (Cavalry) Division, destroyed in the Don River fighting at the end of that year. 47/32s also were employed in Tunisia, Sicily and Italy.
