Description of L6/40: 
The L6/40 is a tracked light tank made by Ansaldo for the Royal Italian army during the 1940s. The L6/40 was based on a heavily modified L3 chassis, keeping the two-person crew, but with an increase in firepower, protection, and mobility. It was heavily used during the occupation of the Balkans where it proved its worth. It was armed with the 20 mm Breda Mod.35 autocannon, able to fire a multitude of munitions including the Perforante mod.35 and the German PzGr 40.
