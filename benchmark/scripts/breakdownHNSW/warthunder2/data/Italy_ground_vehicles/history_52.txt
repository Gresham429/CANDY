History of Leopard_40/70: 
The story of the Leopard Bofors da 40/70 would begin during the late 1990s. Decades earlier, Italy had managed to not only buy but also licence-produce the Leopard 1 main battle tank. The Italian army was equipped with several variants of the Leopard tank, initially a small batch of Leopard 1A1s, which were then later upgraded to Leopard 1A2s. Years later, Italy would be one of the biggest users of the Leopard 1 tank, mainly thanks to OTO Melara who were producing them non-stop. Italy was no stranger to modifying the Leopard platform and at one point a study was conducted which aimed to equip the Italian army's Leopard 1A1s with the Italian-made "Thetis" thermal imager system: only a singular prototype was completed. That wasn't it however, Italy would also test the OTOMATIC anti-air turret by mounting it on the Leopard, and although that showed positive results, it also wouldn't be picked up. One of if not the very last modification to the Leopard platform by Italy would come in the form of the Leopard Bofors da 40/70.
