Usage of SIDAM_25_(Mistral): 
The SIDAM 25 can be quite deadly when used right, players who have unlocked this machine will get to experience for the first time in the tree, an anti-air vehicle with firepower that rivals or in some instances, is more effective than other nations counterparts. The best way to play with the SIDAM 25 is to play very defensively. Due to it being based on the widespread chassis known as the M113, the SIDAM sadly does not have the best performance on or off road, even a small incline will seriously impact your overall mobility when using the vehicle. It is best to stick to flat ground where your vehicle can be much easier to control. The M113 also does not have the best survivability, so in that the SIDAM also sadly suffers in that area, so it is best to stick with more protected teammates or to flat out stay away from any type of enemy ground vehicles. Artillery will also be able to pressure damage you so in that case you should try your best to move away and avoid getting hit by it in the first place.
