Usage of L3/33_CC: 
The L3/33 CC is best used in ambushes, as this tactic allows it to strike from a close distance; a hill can provide a nice spot for this, as the L3 has 15 degrees of gun depression and can get to cover by simply reversing if it is spotted in time. It is also useful as a flanker due to its small size (hard to spot) and high mobility. You can also get into a lot of small hiding spots due to the tanks small size and low profile. This is particularly useful when capturing points, as enemy tanks cannot capture a zone when an ally is inside of it. Simply get to a capture point, hide somewhere within the point, and prevent enemy tanks from capturing it. You can also hide in plain sight and turn off your engine, though this is much riskier. This works only in RB/SB since the nametag gives your position away in arcade.
