Description of CM52: 
The Complesso da 12.7mm su CM 52 is a rank II Italian SPAA 
with a battle rating of 2.3 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update "Apex Predators". The Fiat 6601 ACM 52 "Quadrinata is a great anti air pick for its battle rating, being equipped with the Maxson M45 mount which uses four 12.7 mm M2 machine guns and is in many ways similar to the M13 and M16 GMCs present in other tech trees. It does suffer from a lack of armour and poor frontal gun depression, but makes up for it in speed. In maps with roads you can be very hard to find as you can quickly move from places, meaning enemy aircraft will have to spend more time which gives you the upper hand in engagements. In game you also at times may be able to destroy enemy ground vehicles granted they have little armour.
