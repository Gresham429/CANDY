History of 90/53_M41M: 
The Semovente M41M da 90/53 consisted of a 90 mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on the rear of a lengthened M14/41 hull and chassis. The engine was moved from the rear of the vehicle to a central position. Conceived and built specifically for anti-tank use on the Eastern Front after it was clear Italian forces had no answer to Russian tanks like the T-34, was hurriedly designed and rushed into production in early 1942. In practice the large gun overstressed the chassis and engine, so production stopped after 30 were produced and none were ever sent to Russia. Only a handful of rounds could be carried on the vehicle; it had to be accompanied by a turretless L6/40 tank used as its ammunition carrier.
