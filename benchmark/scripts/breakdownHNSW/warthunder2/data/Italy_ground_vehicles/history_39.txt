History of StuG_III_G_(Italy): 
The story of the StuG begins during the interwar period of Germany, there was a clear missing asset for the German army, a vehicle which could fit the role of a self-propelled gun, which followed the same style of doctrine thanks to combat experiences in World War I. Overall, there was a major need for a mobile artillery piece which could keep up with the German infantry and fight enemy fortifications with a direct-fire assault role. After a few prototypes and refinement to the designs, the StuG III would officially enter full-scale production from January 1940, and would serve in many countries up till the end of the war in April 1945. The main reason it saw such extensive use was due to the many upgrades done on the vehicle to increase serviceability and it being a low cost platform to maintain operational. In terms of survivability, the StuG III featured about 50 mm of armour on the front, but about 30 mm of armour everywhere else, this was upgraded to 80 mm as the war progressed. The StuG in German service also had access Sch√ºrzen armour plates installed on the hull to protect the weaker hull sides against anti-tank rifles and HEAT rounds.
