Usage of M36B1: 
The M36B1 is best used as support vehicle or flanker, it is heavily recommended that you play in Ground Realistic battles in this role, as in Arcade battles you'll be at a major disadvantage, due to enemies being able to spot you easier (as your nametag will be visible). At its battle rating, your armour won't be able to withstand much that comes towards you frontally. From the sides you are at your weakest point, experienced players will easily make short work of you by shooting where your ammo is stored. Another weakness is the fact that the M36B1 is an open-topped vehicle, meaning that artillery and enemies attacking from the air will be much more effective in eliminating you. So it is advised that you stick with teammates who are able to withstand hits. For tactics, although this vehicle is not the most mobile in the Italian tech tree, it can still be effective if in the right conditions. Not all is bad however: one of the upsides of this vehicle is the armament. This vehicle has access to a HEAT shell as its top tier round, which will be very effective for most tanks you'll face. With it, you can become a very effective, albeit not very fast, support flanker. If an enemy knows your location and has an operational gun, you should not push out into their line of fire, as they are likely to come off better than you. You aren't the most stealthy, and considering you dont accelerate very quickly either. Therefore make sure your enemy isn't aware of your presence before you engage, this will maximize your survivability and should allow you to stay in the battle for longer. Overall either stick with teammates and support, or flank the enemies and try to take out targets whilst being hidden.
