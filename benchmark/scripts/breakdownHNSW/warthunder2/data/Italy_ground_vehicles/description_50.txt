Description of Sherman_Vc_(Italy): 
The M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly is an up-gunned modification of the M4A4, which is the fifth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. Armed with the powerful 76 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder tank gun, this stopgap combination (before the introduction of the new generation of Allied tanks) was one of the most lethal tanks of its day, adding weight to the Allied battle to gain victory. Following Italy's rebuilding in 1945, some M4A4 Sherman VC Firefly variants were transferred to the country. In 1946, a minor military command was established for territory defence, and the unit received numerous other M4 Sherman variants. They served as the foundation for the first post-war tanker training school in Italy. In 1952, all M4 Sherman variants were officially decommissioned.
