History of 75/32_M41: 
Mid-1943, some Semoventi 75/18 were with the improved 75/32 field gun. The gun sported a longer barrel and offered increased muzzle velocity, flatter trajectories, bigger accuracy and a better range compared to the 75/18 howitzer. It was produced to only 25 units as the Italian command ended up favouring the L/34 gun for the anti-tank role and later switched the production of Semoventi to the 75/34 M42.
