History of AB_43: 
A prototype successor to the successful AB 41 armoured car. The turret was widened, with plans for a 47 mm gun (either the 47/32 or the new 47/40 to be used in the new M15/42 tanks) and a more powerful engine. The Germans seized the prototypes in the fall of Italy and ordered 102 made for their own use, which used the AB 41's 20 mm gun instead. These were sometimes designated AB 41/43s in German service.
