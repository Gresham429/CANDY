History of M3A3_(Italy): 
After World War II, Italy joined NATO. As part of the military aid program, the United States supplied Italy with a diverse set of vehicles, including the M3A3 Stuart, which was designated Carro Leggero M3A3 in Italian service. The Military Aid program which the Stuart would first appear in would be in the year of 1948, allied countries such as America proceeded to distribute several different types of surplus armoured fighting vehicles for Italy. Delivery of the inital batch of vehicles would continue up until February of 1949, the contents of this package also included various types of Sherman tanks, artillery pieces, trucks and munitions. The first units would enter service in Italy with the Armoured Calvary Squadron, and 2 other armoured battalions made from previous brigades which broke up during the last stages of the second world war. In Italy it was actually very good piece of kit to have access to, it was light, easily transportable and gave infantry and other security roles a vehicle with decent armour protection, at least when compared to what previously was being fielded. Some in Italy would be modified to fit the reconnaissance role, which would remove the inital turret and replace it with a mount for a 50 caliber machine gun. The standard variant would have a crew of 4, whilst the reconnaissance variant only needed a crew of 2. During its service, it didn't face any combat, but would recieve a potential upgrade program which replaced the american cannon with an Italian made one. This was likely to see if there was room for conversion to allow the tank to remain in service longer. Overall the M3A3's in Italian service would be operational up until the year of 1957, where the last units would officially be replaced by more modern vehicles better adapted for Italian needs.
