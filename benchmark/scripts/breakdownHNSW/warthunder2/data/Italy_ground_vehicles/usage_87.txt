Usage of Freccia: 
The Freccia IFV can be a very effective stand-off platform that you can use against the enemy team. Unlike other similar IFVs at or above its battle rating, the Freccia is not super effective at closer distances. The best way to play with the Freccia is flanking the enemy team or getting to spots where enemies won't expect to be be engaged from. The armament of the Freccia consists of a singular 25 mm Oerlikon autocannon, able to fire APDS and APFSDS when you research and buy the modification for it. It also has access to 2 x 7.62 mm machine guns, but these aren't really something which sets the Freccia apart from its peers. The main defining weapon system on the Freccia is the Spike-MR fire-and-forget anti-tank guided missiles. This Israeli-made ATGM allows the Freccia to easily dominate in open maps where hard cover is not easily accessible. At the start of matches, you can quickly make your way to spots where incoming enemies are spotted and freely fire your ATGMs even while moving. This strategy allows you to engage and drive away usually before an enemy has enough time to react and engage you. The Spike missile allows the Freccia to be best played as a sniper, for example on the Fields of Poland map the Freccia can set up near the woods on both sides of the map and fire at enemies across the map without much issue. The Spike is not effective at close range due to how the missile is set up to fully function. It requires at least 1-3 seconds of flight time to adjust itself to hit an enemy. At close ranges, the Spike will often not do enough damage and the missile was made to hit enemies at the top of their turrets, where the armour is usually at its weakest.
