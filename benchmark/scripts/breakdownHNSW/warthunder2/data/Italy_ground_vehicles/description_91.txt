Description of Ariete_AMV: 
The C1 Ariete was developed by Consorzio Iveco OTO Melara (CIO) during the late Cold War to allow the Italian army to equip itself with a modern tank which could easily deal with Yugoslav and Warsaw Pact tanks. The AMV PT1 is a further development of the C1 Ariete, it being the first prototype of the AMV program which aims to upgrade several features to improve the tank and extend its life. The PT1 specifically features mobility improvements which allows the tank to be on par in terms of mobility with the rest of the top-tier MBTs.
