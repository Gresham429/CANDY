Usage of AUBL/74: 
The AUBL/74 is most effective in a scout-support role from cover or when flanking. The extremely weak armour of the AUBL will not be enough to resist any frontal engagements. The HEAT shell can penetrate most enemies at the rank, but the post-penetration damage is unreliable: most shots should be aimed at crew members like the gunner. With the AUBL's slower than average reload speed, an enemy with high crew agility and expert qualification can get their gunner back and shoot before the AUBL reloaded, so the turret or ammo racks are often the best areas to target in order to eliminate enemy tanks. Peaking and firing in shoot and scoot is also suggested, as the small numbers of crew members on the AUBL won't usually resist a shell impact to the turret - firing before being seen is the best way to engage threats.
