Description of OTOMATIC: 
The development of the OTOMATIC began in the late 1980s when OTO Melara designed the family of OF-40/Palmaria vehicles, including MBT, ARV, and SPAA variants. Initially, OTO Melara proposed the ATAK-35 CA for the SPAA role, which was equipped with the Dutch Cheetah PRTL turret (similar to the Gepard's). However, this design did not generate much interest, despite being tested by multiple nations. As a result, OTO Melara came up with a new and radical design for the SPAAG, featuring a modified version of the naval 76 mm cannon developed by OTO Melara as the main armament. This anti-air vehicle was named OTO Main Anti-aircraft Tank for Intercept and Combat, or OTOMATIC for short. The OTOMATIC garnered interest from both the Italian army and air force, as Italy lacked a sophisticated self-propelled air defense system at the time, most examples instead being truck-transported static emplacements. The OTOMATIC also offered advanced features such as an extremely modern FCS with search and tracking radar, as well as a datalink for easy integration into a nation's air defense network. The 76 mm calibre allowed compatibility with rounds used by naval forces, and a special APFSDS round was also developed for potential use against enemy vehicles. Unfortunately, the OTOMATIC proved to be too expensive for Italy, and they ultimately chose the SIDAM 25 as a less sophisticated but more cost-effective option that could be acquired in larger numbers.
