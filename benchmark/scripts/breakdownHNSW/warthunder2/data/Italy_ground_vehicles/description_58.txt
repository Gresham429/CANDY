Description of M26_%22D.C.Ariete%22: 
The M26 (132nd Armored Division) is an American-made tank which was widely used by Italy during the early stages of the Cold War. The Italian Army would receive M26 Pershing tanks from the USA as part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act at the beginning of the 1950s. The previously supplied M4 Sherman had become obsolete and needed replacement. They would be in service for many years and quickly became one of the strongest platforms at their disposal. The 132nd Armoured Division "Ariete" was created in 1939, it fought during the North African campaign until their destruction at the 2nd Battle of El Alamein. In 1948, the Ariete Division was reconstituted at Forte Pietralata in Rome and transferred to Pordenone in the Friuli region in Northern Italy to prevent any invasion by armoured divisions of the Warsaw Pact's armies. The M26 was allocated to the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete at the Eastern border with Yugoslavia but never saw combat action.
