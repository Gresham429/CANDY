Usage of Ariete: 
The C1 Ariete has access to a decent APFSDS round known the DM53 which can easily take care of the majority of MBT's you'll face at your battle rating. What makes this C1 Ariete unique is that it has access to a special modification known as the WAR add-on armour kit. This is one of the later modifications you can install unto the C1 Ariete which greatly improves survivability against APFSDS rounds such as some 125 mm APFSDS munitions found primarily on Russian MBT'S. The WAR kit is not as good as soaking up damage as the PSO kit when it comes to HEAT and the majority of low level IFV autocannon fire, however it still is useful and will surprisingly come in useful when you least expect it. The best playstyle for the C1 Ariete especially when you are just starting out with it, would be more a supportive one, such as flanking manoeuvres or to stick with your better armoured teammates who can withstand hits such as Leopards 2A6. The Ariete being one of the weakest top tier MBTs for its battle rating, it is advised to keep your distance and try pick enemies from far away. With the DM53 APFSDS round, you can easily take out the majority of enemies with one hit if you aim right. Most top tier MBT weak spots at the front are the lower front of the vehicle. If you manage to flank the enemy team, go for the sides or where the ammunition is stored as that also will usually get rid of an enemy quickly. When you have unlocked the WAR add-on armour kit, you have more chances to play hull down which will greatly increase your overall effectiveness on the battlefield, as you'll be able to withstand some shots coming your way. Mobility wise this is much better than the PSO, you will be able to keep up with your team and at times be even faster than some tanks such as the Challenger 2. Remember that in Arcade Battles, enemies can easily find out where you are with your name tag and where your weak spots are so try not to be out in the open when possible. The C1 Ariete also has access to commanders thermals, this will be one of the most useful items in your arsenal and will allow you to better spot enemies from behind cover, as well as quickly engage and disengage without exposing yourself long enough for the enemy to see you coming. If you can master this technique, you'll be able to still be useful despite being at a disadvantage.
