Description of Pz.IV_G_(Italy): 
During the advance of the Allies on Italian territory in 1943, Germany began to send different types of vehicles to Italy (RSI) to increase their effectiveness and in turn improve the defence of the territory, including aircraft, light vehicles, transport vehicles, cannons, and eventually tanks. In particular, Pz.IV G, Pz.III N and eventually StuG III G were sent, these were used in the 1st Armoured Division Black Shirts "M" formed in the same year, and divided into three companies, the first of which was equipped with 12 Pz.IV G. These Pz.IV G were the last examples to be produced, being immediately followed by production of the H and later J versions. The Italian Pz.IV G would not see combat because the division was still in training, and would eventually be recovered by the Germans, only to be captured by the Allies during the advance towards Germany.
