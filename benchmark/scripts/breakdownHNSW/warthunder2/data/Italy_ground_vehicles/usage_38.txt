Usage of 90/53_M41M: 
Due to its high penetration at close ranges, excellent turret traverse and surprising survivability, the 90/53 can perform quite well in CQC combat in an urban environment. The 90/53 is quite lethal to most tanks it comes across and can deal quite easily with vehicles other tanks typically struggle with, such as KV-1s. This comes at the sacrifice of an exposed rear, so it is typically advised to make sure that your rear is always secure and not to overextend from your allies. Alternatively, the high calibre of the shell does make the 90/53 viable at range, but the lack of ammunition and machine guns for rangefinding make this task quite difficult. When entering battle, a full load of Granata Preforante mod.43 is typically advised.
