Usage of OF-40_Mk.2A: 
The OF-40 MK.2A can be a truly powerful vehicle when used in the right hands. For people who are going through the stock grind, it is recommended that you play a support role, until you get access to the APFSDS round. The OF-40 MK.2A is not very armoured, compared to other vehicles it will face, the main weak spots are the hull and the sides. So for people who have just picked it up, either play as a support, sniper or flank, as the stock HEAT round is not very good to deal frontally with most of the enemies. One thing the OF-40 MK.2A has that its German rival doesn't have, is superior turret Armour. This means that you can easily go hull down on certain maps and manage to bounce a few things coming your way. Once you have gone through and researched most of its modifications, such as the APFSDS round and the engine upgrade, you should be ready to play a more offensive role. A good point you could take advantage of is your speed, your engine will be decent enough that you'll easily be with or ahead of your team most of the time. Use your speed at the start of matches to get to positions that enemies might not expect you, which might guarantee you the first shot in most engagements. Your gun is also very good at long ranges so it is also not a bad idea to keep your distances, since you cannot count on your survivalbility at all times. Do the same for night battles. This also should apply for all game modes, be aware that in Arcade battles the enemies are able to see your weak spots when they aim at you, so keep that in mind if you decide to go hull-down as an experienced player might just go for a different module, such as your cannon barrel or breech, and finish you off slowly.
