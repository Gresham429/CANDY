Description of Centauro_I_120: 
The B1 Centauro da 120, also known as the Centauro MGS, originated as a test vehicle made by OTO Melara in the late 1990s which experimented with the new HITFACT MK1 turret, equipped with an OTO 120/45 cannon, modern FCS, improved optics and other improvements. The plan was to convert a small batch of Italian army B1 Centauros, which had access to a 105 mm cannon; however, the Italian army did not see a need for the upgrade as the existing Centauro vehicles met their requirements. As a result, the B1 Centauro da 120 continued to be used for testing purposes and was showcased at military conventions like IDEX, in the hope of attracting potential foreign buyers. Ultimately, the only nation to adopt this variant was Oman, which purchased 9 units for the Royal Omani Guard. The B1 Centauro da 120 continued to undergo testing and served as a stepping stone towards the development of the B2 Centauro.
