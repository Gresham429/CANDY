Usage of 75/34_M43: 
The 75/34 M43 is best when used as a tank destroyer thanks to its good frontal armour and the good penetration of its rounds, provided you stay at a distance guaranteeing your survivability (800-1,000 m). With a maximum penetration of 64 mm at 1,000 m for the APCBC round and 100 mm for the HEAT shell, the vehicle will have no problem penetrating the armour of most enemy vehicles at the BR.
