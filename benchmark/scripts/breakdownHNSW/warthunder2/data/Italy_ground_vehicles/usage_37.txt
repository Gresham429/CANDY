Usage of M42_(Italy): 
In Realistic battles, the Quadruplo is best used in the support role when tank hunting, sticking with teammates, assisting them and potentially distracting the enemy. Your best bet of killing any tank, usually a Sherman, Cromwell or T-34, is from the side as the HVAP will pierce through their side armour, killing the tank. Light tanks such as M24s, Stuarts and Crusaders are able to be penetrated from the front, but usually this is only in close range engagements. T-50 and other slightly armoured light tanks will be tougher to kill, but you're still able to flank them. You can kill basically any SPAA you see, as you'll usually encounter trucks or armoured cars. Ambush and surprise tactics are good options to kill tanks effectively, as the enemy will stroll past you, usually showing their side armour. Aggressive playstyles are suggested to get the most out of the Quadruplo, similar to playing a Wirbelwind when tank hunting. Try not to expose yourself too much and move from cover to cover, as one hit from a tank shell, usually APHE, will knock you out in one shot, or the machine guns pierce your turret armour and kill both your gunner and commander. When it comes to shooting down planes in the Quadruplo, it is best to get their attention so they try to strafe you, or surprise them as they come closer to you, when you have a good shot as they won't have enough reaction time to evade your shots if they connect. Be mindful that you are open-topped, and you're less likely to survive a strafe run. It should also be noted that shooting continuously will sway the hull back and forth, which will make your aim go up and down.
