History of Turan_II: 
At the beginning of the 1940s, the Hungarian military decided to develop its own medium tank on the basis of the recently developed Czechoslovakian T-21 medium tank prototype. After one test unit successfully passed initial trials in Hungary, several changes were made to the design, including the fitting of a Hungarian 40 mm cannon as well as increased armour protection. The resulting T-22 design would then be officially accepted into Hungarian service as the 40.M Turán (Turán I) in November 1940.
