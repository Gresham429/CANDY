History of OF-40_(MTCA): 
The history of the OTO Melara OF-40 began during the late stages of the Cold War. Italy had begun to develop a new MBT for the first time since the Second World War, known as the OTO Melara 'Leone'. This tank was being jointly co-developed by Italy and Germany, based on the Leopard but with some notable differences, such as the turret and armament being made by OTO Melara. The design didn't generate enough interest and ultimately the project wouldn't go further than a single prototype. However, this would kickstart OTO Melara to begin developing tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles once again. One of their earliest being the OF-40, O standing for OTO, F standing for Fiat and 40 standing for the approximate weight of the tank in tons.
