Description of Pz.III_N_(Italy): 
During the advance of the Allies on Italian territory in 1943, Germany began to send different types of vehicles to Italy (RSI) to increase their effectiveness and in turn improve the defence of the territory, including aircraft, light vehicles, transport vehicles, cannons, and eventually tanks. In particular, Pz.IV G, Pz.III N, and eventually StuG III G were sent, and these would be used in the 1st Armoured Division Black Shirts "M" formed in the same year and was divided into three companies, the second of which had 12 Pz.III N, with a particular difference, the removal of the side skirts. The Italian Pz.III N would not see combat as the division was still in training, and were eventually recovered by the Germans only to be captured by the Allies during the advance towards Germany.
