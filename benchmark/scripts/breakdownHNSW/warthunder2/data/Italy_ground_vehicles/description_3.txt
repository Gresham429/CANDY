Description of AS_42/47: 
The Camionetta AS 42 Tipo II "Metropolitana" 47/32 is the third variant of the Camionetta Desertica Model 42 light reconnaissance car family. The AS 42 (Africa Settentrionale = North Africa) was built on the same chassis as the AB 41 armoured car but with a two-wheel-drive powertrain designed specifically for desert operations, especially reconnaissance. Its origins can be traced back to requests from North African divisions for a long-range, highly manoeuvrable vehicle similar to those used by the very effective British reconnaissance and raiding force, the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). The main guns that could be installed were a 20 mm Breda Model 35 autocannon, a 20 mm Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifle, or a 47 mm Breda Cannone da 47/32 Model 39 tank gun. The armour was 17 mm thick all around the chassis, with three 12 mm bulletproof glass plates for the windshield.
