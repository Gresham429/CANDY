Description of Sherman_V_(Italy): 
The M4A4 Sherman is the fifth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. The M4A4, like other variants of the M4 Sherman family, was part of the military aid delivered to Italy after World War II ended in 1946 to provide equipment for the small military command established for only territory defence. As part of the allied collaboration, the U.S. Army is said to have given at least 57 combined M4A2 and M4A4 variants to the reconstituted Italian Army. These tanks were employed from 1948 to the early 1950s, with the final ones being officially retired in 1952.
