History of AUBL/74: 
The AUBL/74 (Autoblinda 1974) prototypes were built upon the FIAT 6616 chassis which then got modified with a 90 mm Cockerill Mk. III gun or a 60 mm HVG gun. These modifications intended to meet the Italian army requirements for a combat-capable light reconnaissance vehicle and troop transport of the military branches, but perhaps, more importantly, it aimed to evolve as a distinguished yet economic defence solution for the exportation to any developing country amidst the tensions of the Cold war.
