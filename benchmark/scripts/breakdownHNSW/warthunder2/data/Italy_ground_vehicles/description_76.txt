Description of T-72M1_(Italy): 
The â—”T-72M1 represents the 178 T-72M1s delivered to Hungary by the Soviet Union. Having been delivered in 1979, the tank did not see combat during its service with Hungary. Due to becoming obsolete and the shift towards NATO technology in the Hungarian Armed Forces, these tanks were put into reserve while the Leopard 2 series replaces them during the 2020s. Some of these T-72M1s are supplied to countries that need to replenish their tank fleet of Soviet-built tanks.
