Usage of M14/41: 
In an RB battle, the M14/41 functions very similarly to the M13/40 (III) tank, due to the fact that the two are (essentially) the same vehicle, with the M14/41 simply boasting a more powerful engine and sitting at a higher battle rating. The M14/41 features very thick armour for its rank, especially around the turret, where the angled 25 mm thick armour will often bounce rounds consistently, and the 30 mm frontal armour is not to be underestimated. Combined with a rather well spaced crew of 4, the M14/41 boasts a suprising amount of durability. This very well-protected tank, of course, has a very crucial weakpoint: A massive 30 mm flat plate on the direct front of the tank. A hit through this plate will often kill the driver and, more likely than not, the crucial gunner that sits behind him (and sometimes the commander as well, which will kill the tank). To avoid this, you can attempt to hide your flat plate in an engagement from the front by angling your tank about 30 degrees to the left, which will have your much more angled and durable machine gun port face your enemy, reducing the chance that you will be shot through your flat plate.
