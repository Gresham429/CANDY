Usage of AUBL/74_HVG: 
For the AUBL/74, it is recommended you play in ground realistic battles. This vehicle should be played as either a Scout, Flanker or a Sniper. Use your mobility to relocate from one sniper position to another. Never brawl unless you have to. Due to the highly mobile platform (FIAT 6616), your mobility is one of the best in its class. Use your mobility to get to a good attack position early in the game to launch a surprise attack from the side. Use the terrain and obstruction to hide from enemy. Use the "free-look" button ("C" by default) to look around frequently to learn the situation around you. Make sure nobody is looking at your way before you poke out and fire. As a light tank, you also have the ability to scout enemy players; allowing you to gather intel on the positions of the enemy team, as well as earn points for each vehicle destroyed via your intel alongside assist credit. It's important to note that the AUBL/74 trades armour for mobility and you don't have any armour on this vehicle. With only 8 mm of armour on the front of the hull, the armour on this vehicle won't even stop high-calibre machine gun fire at mid-range. Don't even think about surviving a hit, it's impossible unless it's a sub-calibre APDS or APFSDS round in which case it may pass straight through the vehicle without inflicting any damage. You'll also be at the mercy of artillery, and due to pressure damage you will die very quickly to artillery. Another issue you'll encounter is enemy aircraft, most of their suspended armament and even at times their main cannons or heavy machine guns will take you out with ease. Again, try to keep moving positions or utilize cover, where enemy aircraft have no way of damaging your vehicle. The main armament on this vehicle is a 60 mm HVG cannon made by OTO Melara. It can fire two types of rounds, APFSDS and HE. The HE shell is useless due to the small explosive mass. The only shell you will use is M300 APFSDS shell. It will penetrate 249 mm of armour at close range, fairly decent as a light tank but not enough to penetrate the front of some heavy tanks. Due to the small diameter, the post-penetration damage it inflicts is limited. Try to launch attacks from the side or rear of the target, and aim for important modules first like the gunner or cannon breech. You might not get a one shot kill but you will divert the opponents' attention away from your teammates. The cannon is two-plane stabilized which gives you an advantage to shoot first as a light tank.
