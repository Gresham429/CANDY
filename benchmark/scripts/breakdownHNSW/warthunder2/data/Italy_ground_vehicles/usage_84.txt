Usage of OTOMATIC: 
The OTOMATIC is one of the more role-diverse SPAA in the game, akin to that of the ADATS with its anti-air/anti-tank missiles. However, the OTOMATIC can practice these diverse roles without needing to notify the enemy of what role it is prior to an engagement. The OTOMATIC has the mobility, speed, armour and electronics to make it one of the best SPAA or anti-tank vehicle, depending on what the commander or battlefield situation dictate.
