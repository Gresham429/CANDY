History of Freccia: 
The story of the Freccia IFV began during the late stages of the Cold war. The Italian army had always seen a need for well-armed wheeled vehicles, so during the Cold War, OTO Melara assisted by Iveco had been working on many different wheeled designs, mainly made in hopes that the Italian army or foreign armies would put said designs into service. Their main goal was to bridge the gap between conventional IFVs and APCs by combining the two. A few designs were created, the first being the B1 Centauro IFVs (also known as Centauro VBC), which would be armed with either a 60 mm HVMS or a 20/25 mm autocannon with ATGMs, primarily based directly on the pre-existing Centauro series of vehicles. Instead of the usual 105 mm Hitfact turret, the vehicle would be modified to allow infantry on board and the installation of conventional IFV turrets. Although interest had been shown, the market during those times was too diluted with the latest designs, and also due to the overwhelming influx of surplus vehicles from nations such as America, would eventually lead to these vehicles to not get picked up.
