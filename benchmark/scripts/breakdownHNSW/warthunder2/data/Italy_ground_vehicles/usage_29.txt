Usage of M14/41_(47/40): 
The M14/41 (47/40) is basically a M14/41 tank boasting a better gun and thus sitting at a higher battle rating. With the BR increase, the competition gets also tougher. That's why the M14/41 (47/40) features henceforth average armour for its rank, especially the sides and around the turret. Frontally, the massive 30 mm front plate is the biggest weak spot: flat, hard to miss and a penetrating shot through this plate will kill the driver and the gunner that sits behind him. To avoid this, you can angle your tank about 30 degrees to the left to hide your flat plate and present instead the MG bulge that could absorb some shots. This however is not a durable strategy, any expert tanker won't fall for that trick.
