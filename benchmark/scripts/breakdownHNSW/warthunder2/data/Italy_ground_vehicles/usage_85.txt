Usage of Dardo: 
When playing the Dardo, one of the best playstyles for it is either using it as a support or as a flanker. You should attempt to always have a good line of sight where you can take enemies off guard, to maximise the effectiveness of your armaments. One example being that the Dardo at times can be used effectively in urban combat. If you pick a side street to set up, when the enemy goes past, hopefully without seeing you, you will be able to hit them in the side with either your main cannon or with your ATGM. At the start of a match it can prove to be a very effective first spawn in the hands of an experienced player, as enemy players might not expect such a vehicle to cause them troubles early during a match.
