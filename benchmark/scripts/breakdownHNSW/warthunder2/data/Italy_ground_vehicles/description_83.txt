Description of SIDAM_25_(Mistral): 
The SIDAM 25 is an Italian anti-air platform developed by OTO Melara during the Cold War. Based on the M113A1 platform, the SIDAM 25 was primarily designed to fulfill the short-range air defense needs of the Italian army. The Italian army initially showed interest in the OTOMATIC anti-air platform; however, due to factors such as cost, the SIDAM 25 was chosen instead. One of its main drawbacks was that it lacked a radar system unlike other anti-air platforms of the era. A total of 275 systems were ordered. In the late 2010s, the SIDAM 25 began to be phased out, with most units being used to arm the Freccia IFV with a 25 mm cannon. The SIDAM 25 (Mistral) was a sole prototype created to test the capability of the Mistral SAM on the SIDAM 25 platform, and as a last ditch effort for OTO Melara to upgrade the SIDAMs so they could remain in service and not be completely obsolete.
