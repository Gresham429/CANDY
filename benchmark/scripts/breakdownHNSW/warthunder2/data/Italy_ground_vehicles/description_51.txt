Description of M26A1: 
The M26A1 is an American-made tank which was widely used by Italy during the early stages of the Cold War. The Italian Army would receive Pershing tanks from the USA as part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act at the beginning of the 1950s. The previously supplied M4 Sherman had become obsolete and needed replacement. They would be in service for many years and quickly became one of the strongest platforms at their disposal.
