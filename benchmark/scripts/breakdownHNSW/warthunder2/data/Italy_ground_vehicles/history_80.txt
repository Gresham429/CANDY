History of Ariete_(P): 
The C1 Ariete Preserie was one of the first pre-production batches of the C1 Ariete MBT. The Preseries vehicle lacked a lot of details and modifications that the production C1 Ariete would end up having. But before we get into that, the C1 Ariete was born out of the need of the Italian army to modernize the fleet of tanks they had during the cold war. The Italian army utilized several tanks through the years, but the ones that they had in service would not longer be advanced enough to compete with what the rest of the world was doing in terms of tank development. What the Italian army sought was a new main battle tank that could completely replace and finally put out of service their Leopard and M60 tanks. For this, 2 Italian companies took the lead in making the new tank, Iveco and OTO Melara. Iveco primarily dealt with the hull, transmission and engine, while OTO Melara took care of the turret, cannon and the installation of sights. After a few iterations, and mock-up tanks, the first time they were shown to the public, was at a presentation inside of La Spezia in 1987, which also included another new Italian vehicle, the B1 Centauro. The C1 Ariete had many new up-to-date additions, such as having access to the TURMS 3rd generation LTFCS made by Officine Galileo, which gave the capability to the Ariete to fire on the move, both at day and at night. It is not known how many Preseries were be made. One of the Preseries Arietes was for example tested alongside the Italian M60s and Leopard tanks to see how it fared against them in a competition, not surprisingly, the Ariete surpassed them by a long shot, which further propelled itself into being bought and put into official service inside of the Italian army. There were many differences between the Preserie C1 Ariete and the production ones. The Preseries differed heavily design-wise: the Preseries turret was "cleaner", the production one having additional bolts to allow the Ariete to easily install add-on armour if needed,like it happened with the C1 Ariete "WAR" package. The Preseries did not have access to the PSO kit, which alongside the WAR, was available to the production models of the C1 Ariete. It also lacked commander thermals, an upgrade that was performed on the last 50 C1 Arietes produced. The Preseries also lacked one of the more powerful CL3143 APFSDS shells that the production model uses. The cannon the C1 Ariete uses can shoot all NATO standard rounds if needed. Lastly, the Preseries just lacked the overall aesthetic design choices that the production model would have. Once the production models of the C1 Ariete started entering in service, the Preseries were eventually moved into the Italian military vehicle graveyard at Lenta. It is not known if they are still there, but that was the last known places that they were found in.
