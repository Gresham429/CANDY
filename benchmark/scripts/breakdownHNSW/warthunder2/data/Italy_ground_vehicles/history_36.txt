History of Sherman_Ic: 
The Firefly first saw action in Italy in British, American, and Polish hands in the Italian Campaign in 1944, but were ceased since heavy German armour proved to be a challenging opponent for the Firefly. After WW2, Italy was supplied with tanks by the US and UK, such as the Sherman Firefly (designated as M4 Tipo IC or M4 Tipo VC depending on the variant) and M24 Chaffee, which were commissioned in 1947. At that time, Italy created the first nucleus for the formation of a tankers school and on the 1st of October officially formed the Military School Organization.
