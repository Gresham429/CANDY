Usage of FIAT_6614: 
The FIAT is a light tank destroyer with extremely potent anti-tank grenades that are almost guaranteed to slice through any armoured foe. Putting it on a frontline is a risk, as its armour is not going to stop anything heavier than 7.62 mm machine gun fire, so striking from the shadows or taking over a fortified position are the best options. One of the main upsides is that you don't have an actual gunner who exposes themselves to fire, meaning all you have to do is find a great position and remain hull-down. Getting to said position is fairly easy if you are on a map with easily accessible roads. The FIAT 6614 will manage to reach its top speed and overtake most of the vehicles at its battle rating, use your speed to your absolute advantage.
