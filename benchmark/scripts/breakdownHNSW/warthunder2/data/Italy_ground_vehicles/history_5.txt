History of M13/40_(I): 
Intended to replace the unsatisfactory M11/39, the M13/40 retained its main mechanical features, but with a more powerful gun in a fully rotating turret. The M13 was slow, unreliable, and suffered from the tank commander doubling as the gunner. Similar to early Russian and French tanks, it did not receive radios as standard equipment until 1942. Nevertheless, it became the standard Italian medium tank from 1941 on, and is the best known Italian tank of the war. In War Thunder, the M13/40 (I) represents those made earlier in the production run, with manual turret traverse instead of hydraulic traverse gear. Reportedly Italian crews would remove the hydraulic traverse, which was cumbersome; the (I) model has extra ammo storage to reflect that.
