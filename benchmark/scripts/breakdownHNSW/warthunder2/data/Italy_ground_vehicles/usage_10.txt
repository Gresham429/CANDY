Usage of 47/32_L40: 
Due to its various drawbacks the 47/32 L40 is almost constantly vulnerable, lacking the mobility and armour to keep itself in the fight. These shortcomings make this vehicle more suited to a defensive role where its drawbacks can be somewhat negated. Like the previous vehicle in the line, the M11/39- this tank works well in ambush, engaging enemies from a static position. Unlike the M11/39 however, this tank can engage at range fairly effectively, as the 47mm cannon will still be able to deal with most common tanks around this battle rating.
