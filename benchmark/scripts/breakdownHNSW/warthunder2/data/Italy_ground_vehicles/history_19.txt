History of Pz.III_N_(Italy): 
The history of Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N began in Germany of 1942, this variant was mainly an assault tank based on the Ausf. L and Ausf. M chassis, which was re-used to produce this tank. This variant was produced to meet the need for a stronger tank, one that could more effectively handle the Soviet T-34 and KV-1. There was also a desperate need for a special infantry support tank which would be used during advances alongside soldiers on the ground. It had a somewhat complicated development cycle, for example the widely used 75 mm long-barreled gun could not be installed in the turret due to the limited turret internal size. The German designers instead decided to use the short-barreled 7.5 cm KwK37 L/24 gun, which would be paired alongside with special hollow-charge shells. This explosive projectile packed more punch than the 5 cm KwK39 L/60 gun, so at the time it was favoured and underwent a series of trials, which were an overall success. Some design features of the tank had to be modified however, for example, the gun's mantlet was redesigned to accommodate the changes done. Other aspects of the vehicle also became better: the gun's recoil mechanisms were improved, the single-hinged hatch for the command turret was replaced with a two-hinged hatch, the thickness of the commander's cupola was increased to 100 mm. This variant's overall operational weight was around 23 tons. Most of the tanks received 5 mm side skirts (Sch√ºrzen) to protect the tank's hull and turret., however Italian variants, in Italian fashion, removed said side skirts. Production of the Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N tanks began in June 1942 and lasted until August 1943. A total of 700 of these tanks were built. 3 were built from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. J tanks, 447 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. L tanks, 213 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. M tanks, and 37 from other variants after they had returned from the front.
