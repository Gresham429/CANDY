Description of C13_T90: 
The OTO Melara C-13 was developed as a replacement for the ageing M113 and similar vehicles used by armies worldwide. The platform was designed to allow multiple different armaments to be installed and be easily modified to suit various roles. OTO Melara produced several prototypes, some of which mounted the TUA (TOW under armour) or the OTO TC-25 turret. Although several countries expressed interest, it did not gain popularity due to the saturation of the market with light tanks. The variant represented in the game is equipped with a 90 mm Cockerill cannon capable of firing HEAT and HESH munitions, and was designed to support infantry and main battle tanks.
