Usage of Zrinyi_I: 
Due to the mediocre armour of the Zrinyi I, it should not be played as a frontal assault tank and you should not rely on its armour. Since the Zrinyi I is a turretless tank destroyer as well, you should try to avoid close quarters combat as fast enemies will be able to drive around your sides and you will be too slow to turn your vehicle and so you won't be able to shoot at them. In many close quarters situations, it is better to use your great reverse speed to get away from close opponents rather than trying to turn to engage them immediately. If you lose your engine or tracks, you will only have a limited field of fire, and no ability to retreat. Your enemy can just drive out of your field of fire and you will be defenceless. Going around corners is also dangerous in turretless tank destroyers such as the Zrinyi I, because you will have to drive around the corner, turn your entire tank, and then take aim, whereas a turreted vehicle can aim their turret before turning the corner, drive around the corner and fire immediately. Due to the fact that most enemies can reliably destroy your vehicle from the front with one shot, never drive around a corner to fire at an enemy if they are aiming in your direction. If the building the enemy is hiding behind is destructable, pre-aim at the enemy tank through a wall and blow up the building with a rocket, this will surely shock your opponent and let you get a free hit on them (assuming you don't miss), maybe you can even retreat or move in before the smoke from building collapse settled down.
