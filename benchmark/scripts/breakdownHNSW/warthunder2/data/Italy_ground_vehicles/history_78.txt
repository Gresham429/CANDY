History of VRCC: 
The story of the VRCC-105 began in Italy during the late stages of the cold war. The Italian army during the 1980s issued a set of requirements for a new vehicle that would have equivalent firepower to the Leopard 1 MBT in Italian service at the time, but with greater combat mobility and the ability to reach greater points of strategic control. In response to this, the Italian companies known as Fiat, Iveco and Oto Melara would have joined forces in a 3-way consortium to begin developing the new vehicle requested by the Italian Army. In this joint venture, Fiat and Iveco were developing the vehicle's hull and power supply, whilst Oto Melara took care of the vehicle's turret, optics and weapon systems. The vehicle would need to be light enough to be be used for recon but also to allow the installation of the turret to not drag the vehicle down. Due to this the Centauro wouldn't be heavily armoured so it did pose a danger to the crew if they were to be hit by an enemy tank. Thankfully what it lacked in protection, meant it excelled in speed. The B1 Centauro was easily able to reach the speed of up to 105+km per hour on road. Due to this feat the vehicle became quite sought after. The B1 Centauro featured a 105mm cannon made by OTO Melara which was able to fire a multitude of NATO standard munitions, such as APDS, HEAT, HESH and APFSDS. In 1986, the final prototype of the B1 Centauro project was unveiled on Sardinia. Impressed by the B1 Centauro, the Italian Military placed orders for a number of vehicles, going in production in 1991 with the first ones entering service as early as 1992. Italy would modify the B1 Centauro during its service, for example some would feature the SICCONA battle management system, but one of the more popular modifications was the introduction of Kevlar shields around the turret which gave an increase in ballistic protection to the vehicle and crew.
