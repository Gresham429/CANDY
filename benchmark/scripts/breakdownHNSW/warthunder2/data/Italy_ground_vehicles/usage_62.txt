Usage of OF-40: 
The OF-40 cannot withstand a frontal encounter most of the time with most opponents due to the lack of a reliable armour, making the tank an easy prey for almost anyone on the battlefield when attacked directly. However, the tank comes with a great mobility, able to reach 65 km/h in RB (72 in AB), making it the ideal tank to shoot at the enemy and rapidly retreat to change position.
