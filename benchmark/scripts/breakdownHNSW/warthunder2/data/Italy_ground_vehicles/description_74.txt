Description of M113A1_(TOW): 
The OTO Melara VTC M113A1 TOW is a rank VI Italian tank destroyer 
with a battle rating of 8.3 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.85 "Supersonic".This vehicle is based on the M113A1 made by OTO Melara, which was fitted with a wide array of armaments. The TOW ATGM which is the main armament of this vehicle can prove to be extremely potent on the right map. There's many ways of playing with this vehicle, for example due to how the TOW is placed, on certain maps a player may be able to find a place to cover the platform whilst only the TOW ATGM sticks out, meaning it can be used to pick off enemies from afar. If you are lucky enough to have bushes, it would be useful to place some on this vehicle. It has no armour, most machine guns will go right through you and since the crewmember which mans the ATGM is exposed it means that enemy aircraft and enemy artillery barages pose a very big threat to you. It is quite mobile despite its size, you should be able to reach spots or even stick with your team without too much of a difference in speed.
