Usage of M11/39: 
Because of its various shortcomings, the M11/39 doesn't have a playstyle that consistently works well every time, but certain ways of play are easily more consistent than others. One effective way to play is in ambush, lying in wait to engage enemies at close range, at distances the cannon is just too inaccurate and lacks the penetration required to be constantly effective, so playing it at close range negates those issues. It's also important to avoid situations where you could possibly meet an enemy on the move, as adjusting your angle to face the enemy tied with how unstable the cannon is when coming to a stop, means that enemy tanks will likely be able to get a shot off on you before you can accurately fire at them.
