History of M18_(Italy): 
Throughout the Second World War, the USA would be experimenting with many different tanks and military vehicles, in the hopes they'd be put into service to help the war effort. In December of 1941, a new requirement from the US high command would initially request a vehicle which incorporated the Christie suspension system, and armed with a 37 mm gun. Considering that during those times, for most new vehicles, they were often derived from a previous existing design, mainly done to save time and money, this requirement instead called for a radical new tank design rather than a derivative of an existing tank, such as the M4 Sherman. Whilst the war was ongoing, the US high command would begin to alter the requirements, mainly due to more powerful enemy vehicles showing up on the battlefield. One of the first changes done during the development was to introduce the new and innovative Torsion bar suspension made by the Buick Motor Division, who were part of General Motors. Later another change was to mount the British made QF 6-pounder gun which at the time would be in use on the British Churchill Mk III tanks. This would lead to one of the prototype vehicles to be made, which would be called T49 GMC. Tests proved to yield adequate results but still weren't up to standard, the US Army wanted the heavier 75 mm gun which at the time would be mainly used on the various Shermans in service. In the end this lead to the T67 GMC prototype, this got closer to the requirements but the US high command felt that more could be done. Finally, the US army decided to mount the 76 mm gun also in development for the Sherman onto the prototype, which now was known as the T70 GMC. Obviously changes to hull shape and turret had to be done, mainly to accommodate all the new requirements and armament set out by the US high command. After some refinement in the design, the US high command eventually approved the prototype for service and finally designated the vehicle as the M18 GMC. The vehicle started production in mid-1943, which went on until October 1944 with a grand total 2,507 units produced. They'd be extensively used, and would yield great results for the most part.
