Usage of M26A1: 
The M26A1 is played in a very similar way to the normal M26, but it has more firepower and a slightly better APCR shell. One of the biggest differences is that it often faces Allied tanks instead of Axis tanks. It's as versatile as the original Pershing but with a better gun. It can be used for supporting a teammate whose tank has a long reload time such as IS-2 or T32. Participate in flanking manoeuvres — your speed and agility are not brilliant, but enough for that. Use the lower profile of Pershing compared to the Sherman's to navigate through the map more stealthily. Your vertical guidance (-10°/20°) allows you to shoot from higher positions without exposing too much of yourself.
