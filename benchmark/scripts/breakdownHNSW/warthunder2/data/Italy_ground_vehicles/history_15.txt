History of Toldi_IIA: 
After defeat in World War I, Hungary, like Germany, was prohibited from having its own army and armoured vehicles. However, like Germany, this ban didn't hold Hungary back for long. After purchasing small batches of Italian and German tanks, the Hungarian government announced its intention to select a foreign tank design to be deployed at domestic facilities. As a result of tests, preference was given to the Swedish light tank Landsverk L-60, which later entered service with Sweden under the designation Strv m/38. The tank was adapted to the types of guns and sights available to Hungary, the turret was slightly modified and launched into series under the name 38.M Toldi. The first series of Hungarian light tanks, built before April 1940, actively participated in combat - including heavy battles on the Eastern Front, where it showed itself completely indefensible against Soviet medium and heavy armoured vehicles. After two modernizations, the protection on the gun mantlet and the frontal projection of the hull was strengthened, and the 40 mm cannon became the main weapon. Now the tank was completely produced from Hungarian components, but with the increased protection and increased calibre, the weight of the vehicle also increased, which subsequently affected its movement performance. Despite all efforts, the upgraded 38.M Toldi II and IIA tanks could no longer compete with the Soviet tanks of the second half of the war. Almost all tanks in the series were lost in battles or by technical failures, the last Toldis were destroyed in the battles for Budapest. The only surviving Toldi IIA tank is currently on display in the Patriot park near Kubinka, Moscow region.
