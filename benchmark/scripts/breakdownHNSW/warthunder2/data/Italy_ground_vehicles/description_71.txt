Description of Leopard_1A5_(Italy): 
The Leopard 1A5 was used by Italy during the last stages of the Cold War. It was actually a hybrid, consisting of a hull from the Leopard 1A2 family that Italy also used and licence-produced by OTO Melara, and the turret of the Leopard 1A5. Italy initially looked to upgrade their own Leopard 1A2s and 1A1s with an advanced Italian-made FCS, but ultimately opted to go with the Leopard 1A5 turret. These new tanks would be delivered between 1971 and 1972 followed by two batches built by OTO Melara under licence, which became one of the bulkheads of the Italian army alongside the American M60, which Italy also licence-produced. The Leopard 1A5 would mainly serve in the Italian army as part of the KFOR taskforce.
