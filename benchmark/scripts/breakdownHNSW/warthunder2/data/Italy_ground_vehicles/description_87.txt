Description of Freccia: 
The Freccia IFV, made by Iveco and OTO Melara, was an Italian IFV designed to meet a new requirement from the Italian army for a new modern vehicle that would be able to successfully replace the obsolete fleet of VCC-2 APCs that had been serving in the Italian armed forces for many years. Iveco and OTO Melara would eventually design something closely based on the Centauro family of vehicles, which would end up being known as the Freccia. It would enter service in 2009 and continues to serve today in a multitude of locations where the Italian army is stationed.
