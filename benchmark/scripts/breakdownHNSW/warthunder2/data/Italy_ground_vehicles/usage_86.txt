Usage of VCC-80/30: 
The VCC-80/30 has a different style of gameplay than the Dardo IFV, but instead is very similar to the M3A3 Bradley. Do not rush at capture points or enemies, because your main gun cannot damage enemy tanks as easily as the previous Dardo. It's best to stay hidden and therefore not fire as many shots. In terms of the mobility, the VCC-80/30 is almost equal to the Dardo IFV since the hull is the same, just slightly taller. The TOW launchers are equipped with TOW-2, TOW-2B, and also the TOW-2A ATGM with tandem warhead (to penetrate tanks that have ERA protection). It is always recommended to bring some TOW-2B while the rest of the vehicle holds the TOW-2A. The TOW launchers can only be used when in battle mode or when stationary. In addition to the TOW launchers, the VCC-80/30 carries a 30 mm Bushmaster II cannon with a slow rate of fire and increased penetration using APDS and APFSDS. It is very useful for attacking less armoured enemies on the side. Do not to rush the capture points or go to contact with the enemy, look for a way to get around them or attack them by surprise, because only one hit is enough to destroy you.
