History of AUBL/74_HVG: 
The story of the AUBL HVG begins during the Cold War. The AUBL, also known as the Fiat 6616, was a joint venture between Fiat and OTO Melara. After the Second World War, Italy learned the need for light armoured and armed vehicles. After having built the Fiat 6614, OTO Melara experimented by seeing how adding a cannon would do for the vehicle, with also the main focus being for the Fiat 6616 to carry heavier armament for the armoured platoons of the mobile battalions. After several alterations the first prototype was built in 1972, and with many minor improvements, Italy would decide to buy 50 for the Carabinieri (Military Police). It officially entered service in 1975 with a total of 185 units produced. The Fiat 6616 was a great light vehicle that would be able to reach high speeds of 100 km/h if on the right terrain. After Italy had bought theirs, it was decided that the next course of action was to put it on the market, and countries such as Peru and Somalia showed interest and acquired the vehicle. Those countries actually used it in combat, specifically the Somalians. One of the many upsides of the Fiat 6616 was the ability of it being able to travel submerged underwater, increasing its versatility. It was able to fit many different types of armaments, such as a 20 mm Rheinmetall Mk.20 Rh 202 gun, a 60 mm OTO-Breda T60 quick firing HVG, French made HS90, FV101 turret, and also a 90 mm Cockerill Mk.3 cannon. Other equipment that could also be installed came in the form of a unique flare dispenser which would be used for crowd dispersal; many different types of ATGMs such as Milan, MAPAT and TOW, and for export purposes, the Peruvian version would mount an HJ-73C Chinese made ATGM. After having a very extensive service record (Libya safekeeping, Lebanon UN safekeeping, protecting places of high interest in Italy) it was put out of service, now only some remain as static displays or are in storage inside Italy; however as previously mentioned some of the countries that acquired them still use them to this day. The AUBL/74 HVG was first seen in 1989, in the form of 1 singular prototype known. The AUBL/74 HVG would not be picked up by the Italian army nor anyone from the export market, although it could fire OTO-HE and MECAR APFSDS-T (which could penetrate up to 130 mm at 60 degrees from 1,500 m), which allowed it to be a great reconnaissance vehicle for the time, the project didn't continue and OTO Melara continued to experiment on the vehicle by adding more and more diverse armaments in the hopes more nations would acquire it.
