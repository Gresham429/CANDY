Usage of M47_(105/55): 
The M47 is a slow pushing tank with a powerful anti-tank gun. It should not be used as frontline tank but rather as support tank. Its powerful gun is more than capable of dealing with 90% of the tanks it will see at any range. However, as you don't have enough armour to sustain HEATFS shells at that tier, you need to stay aware of your surroundings at all times. This will impact your combat performance and you'll have to adapt your tactics depending on the map. Search for sniping spots with available cover nearby, watch the inclination because your gun can't depress too much (-5Â°).
