History of Sherman_I_Composito_(Italy): 
In America the first M4 Hybrid was built on the 28th Aug of 1943 by the company Chrysler. The tank consisted of a M4 Sherman hull (RHA) welded with a frontal glacis (UFP) of M4A1, basically a mixture of cast and rolled armour. They only modified the hull and the rest was the same. These tanks were sent to Pacific and to Europe theatres where they were used by Allies in that time to fight Germany, Italy and Japan. Later, the tanks would be modified with better guns, leading to various variants showing up around the world. (ex. M4 Tipo IC).
