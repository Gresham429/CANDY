Description of M42_(Italy): 
The Semovente Contraereo da 20/70 quadruplo was an experimental self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon developed for the Italian Royal Army during World War II. The Royal Italian Army ordered the construction of a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon in 1942 to be deployed in the North African theatre of operations and to protect mechanized columns, which were often targeted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the absence of genuine air defence. The hull of the M15/42 was utilized as the foundation for the design to save time and materials. The tank turret was replaced with a polygonal welded open turret that housed a quadruple 20 mm Scotti Isotta Fraschini 20/70 Model 41 autocannon. The first prototype was completed in early 1943 and tested at the Centro Studi Motorizzazione dell'esercito. It entered service in March 1943 and was assigned to the VIII Reggimento Autieri stationed at Cecchignola in Rome, where it was captured by German forces. By April 1945, it was on active duty with the V SS-Freiwilligen-Gebirgskorps, which fought the final struggle against the Red Army in Germany in the Teupitz area.
