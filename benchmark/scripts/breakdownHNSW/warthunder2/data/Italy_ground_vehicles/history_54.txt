History of M36B1: 
In September of 1942, the US Army had begun to equip its specialized departments to bolster their fight against German tanks, with the new self-propelled M10 armed with a powerful 76 mm M7 cannon, although it was evident that the evolution of armour from the opposing tanks would soon force the US Army to equip itself with a new vehicle armed with a much more powerful cannon. The ideal candidate for this new role was the 90 mm M1 anti-aircraft gun, so in April 1942 the first prototype of the new vehicle was built based on a turret mounted directly on the hull of an M4 tank and armed with this gun. To evaluate the installation on an armoured vehicle, two examples of the M1 cannon were modified, subsequently this new weapon was standardized with the provisional abbreviation T7 to which became the M3 model. One of these two guns would be mounted on the prototype of the self-propelled M10 in order to evaluate the possibility of converting part of the production of this vehicle, and in fact no particular problems arose that suggested the opposite. However, it was decided to evaluate the possibility of creating a new turret because the M10 turret presented many balancing problems that made it difficult to continue using it. The task of making the new turret was entrusted to Chevrolet.
