Description of Csaba: 
The 39.M Csaba (t͡ʃɒbɒ) was a Hungarian armoured car designed by Nicholas Straussler. During World War II, it was manufactured for the Royal Hungarian Army and saw extensive use on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. The Csaba is based on Straussler's Alvis AC2 armoured car design and is named after Attila the Hun's youngest son. Following successful trials in 1939, the Hungarian Army ordered 61 vehicles, followed by an additional order for 40 vehicles in 1940. Twenty of them were used as combat vehicles, with the others serving as armoured command and reconnaissance vehicles. The 39.M Csaba was armed with a 20 mm Solothurn QF.36M anti-tank autocannon and a coaxial 8 mm Gebauer machine gun. The vehicle also had a removable anti-aircraft 8 mm Solothurn light machine gun that was fired from the rear hatch. The crew could dismount and carry this LMG while conducting reconnaissance on foot. It also had two driving positions, one in the front and one in the back.
