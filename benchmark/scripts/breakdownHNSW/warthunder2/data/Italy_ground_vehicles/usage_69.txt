Usage of Centauro_I_105_R: 
The Centauro's wheeled configuration offers a highly mobile anti-tank gameplay. Though this movement flexibility comes with the loss of armour protection, hence the preferred gameplay tactics of the Centauro's commander should be based on speedy stealth flanking strikes or reconnaissance (scouting) with a sharp emphasis on sniping.
