Usage of Ariete_AMV: 
The C1 Ariete AMV can be played in different roles. It can be played as a sniper due to its decent APFSDS rounds, good thermal and  laser rangefinder, however you must not over expose yourself since the armour of the tank cannot withstand any hit from any top tier rounds, even some chemical projectile can penetrate the armour of the Ariete, even in the turret. Due to its improved mobility and very powerful round the Ariete fits perfectly in the "glass gun" role, flanking the enemy and hitting them from the side. However the Ariete cannot be used as a brawler since, as previously mentioned, its armour isn't great, and its rounds aren't protected by any kind of blowout panels which means that any penetrating rounds will result if a one shot.
