Description of Toldi_IIA: 
The Toldi IIA is a Hungarian light tank of World War II developed from the Toldi II in order to up-gun it. 80 Toldi IIs were modified into Toldi IIAs sporting 40 mm 37/42M guns, and these served on the Eastern Front fighting Soviet forces. The original Toldi I was developed from the Landsverk L-60 family, and the Toldi II was an improved variant of the Toldi I, with better armour, which the Toldi IIA retains. This allows the Toldi IIA to stand its ground, but it shares some of the same weaknesses as its Swedish counterpart.
