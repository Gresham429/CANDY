History of M14/41_(47/40): 
Historically, this is rather a different vehicle than in-game. The only variant of the M14/41 was a command vehicle, which had its turret removed and only had a Breda mod.38 machine gun mounted as the anti-air weapon on the turret ring, while the 13.2 mm Breda machine gun was hull-mounted. These command vehicles were then added to the SPG platoons. They used RF1 CA and RF3 M2 radios to communicate with Tank Command and other units.
