Usage of SIDAM_25: 
The SIDAM 25 can be quite deadly when used effectively thanks to its heavy anti-aircraft firepower and powerful, if limited, APDS rounds. The best way to play the SIDAM 25 is to play very defensively. Due to being based on the widespread M113 chassis, the SIDAM features mediocre mobility and small inclines will challenge it severely. It is best to stick to flat ground where your vehicle can be much easier to control. The SIDAM lacks effective armour protection, and nearly any round will penetrate you with ease. Artillery will also be able to pressure damage you so in that case you should try your best to move away and avoid getting hit by it in the first place.
