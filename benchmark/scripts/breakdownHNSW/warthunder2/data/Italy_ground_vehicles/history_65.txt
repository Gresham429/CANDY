History of M60A1_%22D.C.Ariete%22: 
The M60 is a second-generation main battle tank made by the USA. It is the fourth and last generation of the Patton family and replaced the M48. It officially entered service in 1962, the first user being none other than the US Army. The story of the Italian M60 begins during the late stages of the Cold War. During the early sixties, the Italian army's tank arsenal did not appear up to standard, mainly due to having to entirely rely on America and other allies for military equipment, due to some laws surrounding the production of military arms. In fact, hundreds of tanks dating back to the Second World War were still being actively used in nearly all frontline units. Some of these units would include vehicles such as the M4 Sherman, M24 Chaffee, M36 Jackson, M10 Wolverine and the M26 Pershing. These tanks were now completely obsolete in the modern warfare setting; the leading vehicles of the Warsaw Pact, such as the T-54 and T-55, had already surpassed them in nearly every way. Thus the Italian Army Staff (SME) therefore deemed it necessary to improve the operational capability of the national tank component by following two lines of action. The first one was to continue the introduction of M47s from other NATO armies, which had usually been obtained at very favourable prices, even despite having to entirely rely on foreign countries. The other line of action was to keep on introducing newer vehicles at a modest rate, with modern performance and the ability to compete with the best and latest main battle tanks coming out of the Warsaw Pact. In general, there was a need for a more powerful MBT, that even the M47, one of the most powerful tanks they had at the time, couldn't be on par with. The M47, in fact, although being appreciated by its users for its sturdiness, ease of use, decent mobility and enough firepower to deal with most modern tanks at the time, it sadly did not fully satisfy the requirements of the "Ariete" and "Centauro" divisions. This meant that something had to be done, and had to be done fast.
