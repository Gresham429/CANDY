Usage of 75/18_M41: 
The Semovente will struggle to be effective with the extremely poor penetration of its APCBC rounds. With a max penetration of barely 50 mm at point-blank range, the vehicle will have problems penetrating the angled front armour of many similar rank vehicles. Light tanks, armoured cars and SPAA are the easiest targets. In a full uptier, the Semovente will struggle to do any damage at all with stock shells. In this case, it is best for drivers to attempt to flank and shoot enemies from the side, where the powerful explosive capacity of the APCBC shells offer excellent single-shot knock-out capability.
