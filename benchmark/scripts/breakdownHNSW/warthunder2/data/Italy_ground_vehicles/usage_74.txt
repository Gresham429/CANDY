Usage of M113A1_(TOW): 
The M113A1 TOW is best used as a surprise sniper and support vehicle, for this it is heavily recommended that you play in Ground Realistic battles, as in Arcade battles you'll be at a major disadvantage, due to enemies being able to spot you easier (as your name will be visible) and you'll mostly be seen on the mini-map which means that any form of surprise attack or ambush is nearly impossible. In Realistic battles however, the M113A1 TOW shines, the best way to play this vehicle is to hide in places where you're able to shoot from far away, whilst having a great view of the battlefield. Maps such as fields of Poland are really good if you position yourself somewhere were you have cover, a great view which you can easily take advantage of and turn the tide of battle into your teams favour.
