Description of VBC_(PT2): 
The VBM Freccia is an Italian IFV designed by Iveco and OTO Melara for the Italian army with the aim of replacing the VCC-1 and VCC-2 armoured carriers that were previously in use. The vehicle's history dates back to the 1980s and 1990s when Italy was experimenting with the Centauro tank and modifying it for various roles, under the "VBC" program. Although the program was shelved, the idea resurfaced in the late 2000s, prompting Iveco and OTO Melara to revive their efforts. The VBC PT2 is the second prototype of the Freccia and features the TC-25 Hitfist turret, which is also present on the VCC-80 Dardo IFV. However, this vehicle does not include the TOW ATGM.
