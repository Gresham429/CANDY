History of M109G_(Italy): 
The story of the M109 begins during the late stages of the Cold War, it would be designed due to a need from the American army to completely replace their aging fleet of M44 self-propelled howitzer. The main objectives for the new and improved replacement were for it to be somewhat mobile and have a bigger calibre. Initial prototypes for the M109 would see it armed with a 105 mm cannon, but would later be changed to a 155 mm. It was also chosen to equip the vehicle with a diesel engine which, although it would prove to give less output, was much more reliable so breaking down would not become a common occurrence. It would first officially enter service in the American army by 1961, and would prove to be quite effective on the battlefield.
