History of Lancia_3Ro_(100/17): 
The story of the Lancia 3Ro began during the mid-1930s, when Vincenzo Lancia started producing Ro trucks using Junkers diesel 2-cylinder 3.2L engines. In October 1937, the new 3Ro was introduced with a civilian variant (Serie 464) and a military variant (Serie 564). Deliveries began in 1938. It was very reliable and due to its performance on sandy terrain, it was given the nickname "Re del Deserto" (King of the Desert). Trucks captured by the British-led forces were kept in use. The Soviets also allegedly captured some for their own use, primarily because they were easy to maintain and also had great off-road mobility for a vehicle of its class.
