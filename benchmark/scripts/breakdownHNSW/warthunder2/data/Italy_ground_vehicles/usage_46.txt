Usage of Breda_90/53: 
This truck has similar playstyle to all artillery trucks, meaning that in general you want to find some faraway point and shoot people that try to get onto capture points or to shoot you (which they should never be able to do, unless you get distracted in real life). If you get bombed, try to drive away anyway with your forward gear, as in AB bombs are quite small and not many people bomb from optimal altitude of 1.8 km, letting you escape even if you didn't notice them falling. Some problems may arise if random howitzer tank decides to fire at you mortar style with HE or HEAT shells (meaning you will most likely die on their first shot due to it literally falling from space), but this is very rare and majority of enemy SPG are very predictable and will just try to fire over a hill. if you see someone preparing for such a sneak attack, you need to proactively remove the threat - aim at the top of their roof with the help of binoculars and blow them up first.
