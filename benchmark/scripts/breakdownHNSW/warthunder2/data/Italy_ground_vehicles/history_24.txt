History of 75/34_M42: 
Following the success of the Semovente da 75/18 in its anti-tank role, the Italian command ordered in October 1942 the development of an improved version of the Semovente based this time on the M15/42 chassis and a 75 mm L/34 Breda cannon, a gun with identical performance to the one equipped on the P26/40 tank. The new vehicle was accepted in April 1943 and production started in May 1943 with an order for 280 Semoventi. Due to wartime shortages of materials and manpower, only 93 tank destroyers were produced by the Italians before the Armistice and only 60 vehicles delivered to their combat units. The Germans then seized control of Northern Italy and continued its manufacture, completing 80 more units alongside 36 already confiscated ones.
