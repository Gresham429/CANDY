History of P40_%22G.C._Leoncello%22: 
The story of the P40 tank began in the 1940s, the Italian high command, under order of leader Benito Mussolini, would bring out a set of requirements for an entirely new tank that could work with existing vehicles that were already in service. The recent Africa campaign had shown the massive problems the Italian tanks in production had, namely a lack of armour and insufficient firepower, prompting the army to make some changes. Ansaldo, assisted by Fiat, would design the tank. During development, there were some disagreements between the engineers and high command, high command wanted a diesel powerplant, while the builders favoured a petrol engine. However, neither of those engines were available at the time that could produce the desired output for the tank. Thus, a new engine had to be designed from scratch, this would be a major setback as development would be quite slow. Even when the new engine was made, they decided to go with the V-12 SPA 342 diesel engine, which produced 330 hp and allowed the P40 to reach speeds of up to 40 km/h.
