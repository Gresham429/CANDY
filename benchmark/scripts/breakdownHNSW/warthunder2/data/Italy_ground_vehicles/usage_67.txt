Usage of VCC-80/60: 
When playing the VCC-80/60, some of its playstyles for it include using it as either a support or as a flanker. You should attempt to always have a good line of sight where you can take enemies off guard to maximise the effectiveness of your main calibre armament. One example being that the VCC-80/60 at times can be used effectively in urban combat, usually if a player was to pick a hidden spot to set up, when the enemy goes past hopefully without seeing you, you will be able to hit them in the side with your main 60 mm cannon. This vehicle at the start of a match can prove to be a very effective first spawn in the hands of an experienced player, as the enemy team might not expect such a vehicle to cause them troubles early during a match. To maximise the effectiveness of this vehicle, you must learn what it excells at, and what its not so good at.
