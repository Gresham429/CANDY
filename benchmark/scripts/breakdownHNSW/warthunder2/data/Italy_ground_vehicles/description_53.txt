Description of R3_T20_FA-HS: 
The OTO Melara R3 Capraia was a reconnaissance vehicle made mainly for the export market. The Italian army did also test it as they were interested in seeing if the Folgore regiment could have a use for it. The R3 Capraia was made in at least 7 prototypes, each with their own special configurations and armaments. Despite interest, no country ultimately put it into service due to a saturated market for light reconnaissance vehicles. The R3 Capraia was equipped with various armament options, including a 7.62 mm machine gun, a 12.7 mm machine gun, a TOW ATGM launcher, and two variants of recoilless rifles.
