Usage of AS_42/47: 
The AS 42/47 should be mainly used for flanking. It has the speed to reach flanking positions before the enemy does. The gun, while not impressive, has enough penetration and explosive filler to knock out most tanks that it can meet, especially when you hit them from the side. However, the penetration is still not very good, and as such the AS 42/47 suffers when uptiered with the B1 and SU-122 being your worst nightmares as even the sides of them are nearly immune to your gun. Armour-wise, it practically doesn't have any as the crew is completely exposed, making every near exploding artillery shell, machine gun of any size, aircraft strafing, or HE shell a serious threat. That's why you shouldn't drive to choke and capture points with a lot of artillery shelling. Use your speed to change position constantly and don't shoot multiple times from the same position as that could attract an artillery strike from the enemy and with that a free ticket back to the respawn screen.
