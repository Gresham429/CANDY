History of VCC-80/60: 
During the late stages of the Cold War, OTO Melara, assisted by IVECO, had been designing a set of new multi-role armoured fighting vehicles in the hopes that enough interest would be generated to get the vehicles picked up either by the Italian Army or by possible foreign customers. Multiple different types of unique designs, with vastly different sets of armaments would arise during that era. These vehicles would however not generate much success in or indeed outside of Italy, but eventually during the '80s OTO Melara would finally come out with a design which would finally be picked up by the Italian army.
