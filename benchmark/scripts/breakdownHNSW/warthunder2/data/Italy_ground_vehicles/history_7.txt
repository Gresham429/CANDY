History of M14/41: 
After the extensive use in Yugoslavia, Greece and North Africa uncovered numerous mechanical and reliability problems with the M13/40 tank, Italian engineers set out to address these issues. Instead of developing a whole new vehicle which would replace the flawed M13/40, engineers at Fiat-Ansaldo decided to instead further develop and improve the M13/40's design and solve the various issues along the way. As a result, the new M14/41 was developed. Closely resembling its predecessor, the M14/41 was hard to distinguish from its predecessor as most of the changes and improvements were made to the vehicle's internals. Improvements included a new, slightly more powerful engine and transmission, improved air filters and electrics as well as several other changes. Production was quickly approved and began in August 1941, with existing M13/40 hulls simply being upgraded to the M14/41 standard. The first units arrived to frontline troops in North Africa by the end of the year, but only saw limited service in that theatre. The M14/41 was produced for only a short period of time, but close to 700 units were made.
