Usage of Ariete_(P): 
When playing the Ariete (P), there are 2 main ways to maximize your effectiveness. First, if you are playing at your actual battle rating, your armour can actually withstand a lot of shots if played right. Knowing that, play aggressively and surprise the enemy where it does not expect you, an enemy taken by surprise might shoot by reflex without taking the time to aim carefully, giving you enough time to make a clean shot and move onward to the next target. Remember that in Arcade Battles, enemies can easily find out where you are with your name tag and where your weak spots are. Second, in the occurrence of an up-tier, it puts you at a severe disadvantage, since you cannot rely on your armour anymore. It also means you'll have trouble actually picking off enemies as your ammunition will also lack penetration power. So the best playstyle would be more supportive: try flanking manoeuvres, stick with your better armoured teammates who can withstand hits, try your best to attack from the sides as they are always a weak spot, even for the most armoured of MBTs. Doing this will help you stay alive longer and be a useful asset to your team.
