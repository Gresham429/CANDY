Description of FIAT_6614: 
The FIAT 6614 was a APC created by Fiat and OTO Melara. In the post-war period, Italy needed light vehicles that could be deployed quickly and give support to the troops at the front. The FIAT 6614 met all the requirements for this, and was chosen for both military and para-military roles. The prototype was built in 1972, after which it underwent several modifications. FIAT was in charge of the engine and locomotive components, while OTO MELARA was in charge of the armament and hull. The FIAT 6614 had the IVECO 8062.24 diesel engine that allowed the vehicle to reach 100 km/h, and the hull allowed it to carry between 3 to 10 soldiers. One of the prototypes produced would use the 106 mm cannon M40A1 recoilless rifle; it was presented to the Italian army but was never adopted for the simple reason that the army already had better vehicles equipped with the 106 mm in service, and moreover the 106 mm cannon was becoming increasingly obsolete.
