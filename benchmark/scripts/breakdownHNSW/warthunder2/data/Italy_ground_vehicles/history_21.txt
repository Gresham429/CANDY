History of CM52: 
The history of the Fiat 6601 ACM 52 "Quadrinata" started after the second world war. Although Italy had been getting help from various countries thanks to several military assistance packages, Italy wanted to begin to manufacture trucks once again to increase jobs and to begin being a bit more independent on the world stage. Fiat was already experienced in making trucks, both for civilian and military use, so in 1952 production for a new multi-role truck destined for the Italian army would begin. This truck would be known as the Fiat CM52, short for Autocarro Militare 1952. The CM52 would be designed due to a set of requirements by the Italian army which included the ability to be sturdy, have great reliability, and a flexible nature to adapt to all types of terrain, which had to include even the most rugged. Part of the requirement also included the need for a significant payload carrying capability, which meant that the truck not only could be used for troop transport or carrying materials, but also need to be able to carry different types of weapon systems which at the time Italy had in service. This is where the name "Quadrinata" got added, Italy in those years had several Maxson M45 quad-mounts already installed on american donated half tracks, the mounts would have 4 Browning M2HB .50 Cal machine guns attached and would be used for short range air defence against enemy helicopters and low flying aircraft. This mount also proved to be quite useful at supressing enemy infantry due to the fact it was able to fire 2,300 rounds per min. Italy would mainly use the CM52 to transport the mount, and once it arrived at the destination the mount would be removed and placed on the ground, however in emergency situations the crew would also be more than able to use the mount effectively whilst it was still on the truck. What the Italian army liked about the truck included the fact that it could go up to 60km an hour thanks to its Fiat 6 cylinder 364 A/60 diesel engine it has access to. The CM52 would also be exported to many NATO nations and western-alligned countries, it would be produced for 24 years and would also recieve small upgrades during its service which would make it even better than the initial variant. Sadly it doesn't seem it ever saw combat, it would remain in service up until the late stages of the cold war where Italy would begin to phase out the Fiat 6601 ACM 52 in favour for the more modern Fiat Iveco 65-75-90 PC 4x4.
