History of T-72M1_(Italy): 
178 T-72M1s were delivered to Hungary from 1979 to 1987; these were likely licensed production versions from Poland or Czechoslovakia as recorded on SIPRI. They served in the Hungarian Army from Hungary's time in the Warsaw Pact to the time after they joined NATO and are now being gradually replaced by Leopard 2 tanks. Most of these T-72M1s were put into reserve, while some of these vehicles were donated to different countries that needed Warsaw Pact tanks.
