History of Leopard_1A5_(Italy): 
The story of the Italian Leopard 1A5 began during the late stages of the Cold War. Italy equipped several variants of the Leopard tank, first a small batch of Leopard 1A1s, which were then upgraded to Leopard 1A2s. They would be extensively used and at one point a study was conducted which aimed to equip the Leopard 1A1 with the Italian-made "Thetis" thermal imager system to evaluate its implementation on the Italian army Leopard tanks. Only a singular prototype was completed, this was likely due to the Italian army setting its eyes on the more interesting Leopard 1A5, which would also come with a thermal imaging system as standard. Thus, the final standard version of the Leopard 1 was the A5, obtained by extensively modifying many vehicles belonging to previous versions.
