Description of Zrinyi_II: 
The 43M Zrínyi II was a Hungarian World War II assault gun inspired by the German success with the StuG III. Like the StuG, a versatile self-propelled gun built on the chassis of a medium tank, the Hungarians decided to create their own version using the Hungarian Turán tank's chassis. The project was named Zrínyi, after a famous Hungarian noble family and military leader, Miklós Zrínyi. The plan was to produce two variants of the Zrínyi: one with a 75 mm anti-tank gun (Zrínyi I), and one with a 105 mm howitzer for assault operations (Zrínyi II). Around 72 Zrínyi IIs were built and the vehicle saw combat fighting against the Soviets on the Eastern Front and in the defence of Hungary. The production of Zrínyi IIs was severely slowed due to Hungarian factories being targeted by a serious Allied strategic bombing campaign.
