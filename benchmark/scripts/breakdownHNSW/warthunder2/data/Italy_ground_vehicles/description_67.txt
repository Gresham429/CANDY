Description of VCC-80/60: 
The VCC-80/60 is a further development of the VCC-80 prototype which eventually lead to what is known as the VCC-80 Dardo. This prototype was made as the Italian army wanted a mix of 25 mm and 60 mm calibre IFVs at their disposal. The VCC-80/60 is armed with the Italian made OTO 60 mm HVG, which was derived from the joint development of the 60 mm cannon made together with Israel's IMI before the program went separate ways.
