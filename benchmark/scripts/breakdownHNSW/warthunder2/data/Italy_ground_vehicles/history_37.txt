History of M42_(Italy): 
The history of the M42 Contraereo began during the late stages of the Second World War. In the years following 1942, the Royal Italian army would set out a request for a mobile platform which could mount a special anti-air mount to bolster and provide protection to Italian mechanised columns. At the time they would be subject to very frequent air raids by the British RAF. Although they had some anti-air coverage, it was not enough for their needs. Ground units only really widely access to single 20 mm mounts, usually installed on armoured trucks.
