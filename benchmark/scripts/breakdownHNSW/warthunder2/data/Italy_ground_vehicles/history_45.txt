History of Zrinyi_I: 
In 1942, the Hungarian military started the creation of its own fully armored self-propelled guns, which conceptually repeated the successful German StuG III design. This was done to combat the heavily armoured Soviet tanks encountered on the Eastern Front. The Hungarian engineers also chose the domestic Turán medium tank chassis for their domestic self-propelled guns. A fixed armored cabin was installed instead of a tank turret, and a 105mm howitzer was chosen as a weapon for the first vehicles in the series. To ensure the traverse aiming angles of the gun, the Turán's hull had to be widened by 400mm, however, in terms of the main components, the new self-propelled guns were maximally unified with the vehicle. The first prototype was ready by December 1942, and the first batch of 40 vehicles was ordered even before the SPG passed the entire test cycle. The self-propelled gun received the designation 40/43.M Zrínyi II, in honor of the 16th-century Hungarian national hero Miklós Zrínyi. Somewhat later, serial SPGs received side screens. The vehicle turned out to be very successful and was produced until the surrender of Hungary. However, the 105 mm howitzer of the Zrínyi II was clearly not enough to fight Soviet tanks, so by 1944 a Zrínyi I prototype appeared with a long 75 mm domestic anti-tank gun, the 75 mm 43.M, which was the same gun mounted on the Turán III. During the tests, the Zrínyi I prototype received launching tubes for rockets. This prototype did not go into serial production due to the devastation of the industrial enterprises and the defeat of the Hungarian army by the advancing forces of the Red Army.[1][2]
