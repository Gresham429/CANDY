History of Breda_90/53: 
Italian company "Ansaldo de GÃªnes Sampierdarena" began to develop a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun on a wheeled chassis in 1940, which paved the way to mount a 90 mm gun on a truck, with the arrangement allowing for the cannon to direct fire at enemy ground targets. The Breda 51 Coloniale (6x4) army truck was chosen as the main vehicle of choice, and after modifications were made, the official designation of Breda 52 was given. Production of this new vehicle commenced even before the testing phase had even finished in May 1941. By May 1943 a total of 120 of these vehicles were delivered to the Italian Army. The Breda 52 with the Cannone da 90/53 gun was used in battle in North Africa and also to defend Italy from the Allied invasion.
