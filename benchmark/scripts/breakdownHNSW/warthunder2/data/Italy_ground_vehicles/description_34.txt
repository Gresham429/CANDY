Description of Breda_501: 
The Semovente Controcarro Breda 501 (introduced in Update 1.85 "Supersonic".) is an experimental prototype made by Breda during the late stages of the second world war. In 1942, the Italian MOD came up with a set of requirements for a new platform which would build up on the proven gun truck concept used in North Africa by the Italian army. The main improvements would include increasing protection and mobility, this enough would suffice as being able to quickly react to enemy threats was key to slow down an advance. 1 singular prototype of the Breda 501 would be made, during its testing its main armament consisting of a 90mm cannon proved to be more than adaquate to deal with the threats of the era. Due to the Italian capitulation in late 1943 the program, like many others had to be stopped. In game the Breda 501 is placed after the Carro leggero M24, even while stock the main armament is still really good and once you unlocked the most potent munition you will have a lot of 1 shot potential against enemy targets. Your mobility assures that you will mostly be able to reach spots on the battlefield much quicker than both your teammates and the enemies. Use this to your advantage as setting up ambushes with this platform can be effective if done right. Your main weakness when playing the Breda 501 is your lack of armour, you are an open-top vehicle with all of your crew exposed to the elements. Most if not all enemy vehicles you face have access to a machine gun of some kind so at times they won't even need to use their primary armament to get rid of you. Overall the Breda 501 is a great vehicle in the Italian tech tree and is very rewarding once you master its strengths and weaknesses.
