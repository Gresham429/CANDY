Usage of 75/46_M43: 
The Semovente's M43 75/46 lacks any kind of turret, which has its benefits and its disavantages. At a distance, the Semovente's M43 75/46 limited traverse is less a handicap and makes it harder for the weak spots of the vehicle to be hit. The vehicle's primary advantages include its low profile and powerful gun which can easily defeat most enemies it will encounter at range while remaining a relatively obscured target. Using the vehicle's gun depression and low profile to take advantage of terrain, such as a rock, building, or hill, will make it harder to hit, increasing its survivability.  Unlike other Self propelled guns, the Semovente's M43 75/46 does not have unreliable armour, this allows the vehicle to play a more aggressive role.
