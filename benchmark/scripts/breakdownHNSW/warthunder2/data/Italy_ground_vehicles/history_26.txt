History of 75/34_M43: 
After the Italian Armistice in 1943, the Germans took control of Northern Italy and restarted the production of the Semovente da 105/25. The later Semovente da 75/46 on the same chassis appeared, with a better anti-tank gun and added armour. The new gun's production was extremely slow and 29 vehicles mounted instead the 75/34 Mod.SF gun, all served with the Wehrmacht.[1]
