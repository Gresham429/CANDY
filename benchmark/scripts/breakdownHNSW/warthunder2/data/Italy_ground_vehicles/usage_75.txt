Usage of VBC_(PT2): 
The VBC PT2 incorporates the playstyle of the Centauros and the Dardo IFVs, so it's best to play this vehicle as a support to your more armoured allies. The VBC is wheeled meaning that whenever it finds a road it's able to go at much higher speeds compared to many other vehicles at the battle rating. It is best to stick with allies when possible if you are planning to fight enemies head-on. The VBC at times can be used effectively in urban combat. If you pick a side street to set up, when the enemy goes past hopefully without seeing you, you will be able to hit them in the side with your main 25 mm cannon. By doing this you can become quite the annoyance to the enemy team as there's not much they can do to stop you. If you've been spotted however you will need to move as quickly as possible. The VBC, although being fast, is not very survivable. Its armour is only good against machine gun fire and low level autocannon fire. An enemy MBT will make short work of you. One of the many weaknesses of the VBC is the fact that it also has a big profile which usually means hiding is not possible at times.
