Description of AS_42: 
The Camionetta AS 42 (20 mm Breda Model 35 autocannon) is the first variant of the Camionetta Desertica Model 42 light reconnaissance car family. During World War II, the Italian army needed a vehicle that was fast and could cover long distances to carry out reconnaissance missions in North Africa, so the AS 42 was born. Known by two names: Auto Sahariana del 1942 or Camionetta Desertica Mod.42, it was used in various campaigns from North Africa to the Italian Campaign and was also used in the post-war period by the Italian state police, in service from 1942 until 1952. The vehicle also had the possibility of mounting various armaments such as the Fucile Controcarri S Mod.39 (20 mm), 47/32 mod.39 (47 mm) and Breda Mod.35 (20 mm).
