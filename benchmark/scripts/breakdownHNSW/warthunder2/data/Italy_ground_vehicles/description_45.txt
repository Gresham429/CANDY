Description of Zrinyi_I: 
The 44M Zrínyi I was a Hungarian World War II tank destroyer inspired by the German success with the StuG III. The Royal Hungarian Army faced a serious challenge in the late stages of World War II, as they lacked tanks to counter the newest, most well-armoured Soviet tanks. Like the StuG, a versatile self-propelled gun built on the chassis of a medium tank, the Hungarians decided to create their own version using the Hungarian Turán tank's chassis. They also designed their own gun for it, based on the German PaK 40 anti-tank gun. The project was named Zrínyi, after a famous Hungarian noble family and military leader, Miklós Zrínyi. The plan was to produce two variants of the Zrínyi: one with a 75 mm anti-tank gun (Zrínyi I), and one with a 105 mm howitzer for assault operations (Zrínyi II). However, due to various difficulties in production, only the latter variant, the 43M Zrínyi II, entered mass production and saw combat. The former variant, the Zrínyi I, remained a prototype and was lost together with the Zrínyi production line after Hungary was hit by a serious Allied strategic bombing campaign.
