History of M11/39: 
This pre-war design was intended to be the standard Italian medium tank, equipping medium tank battalions in the armoured divisions. Influenced by the British Vickers 6-ton, which can be seen in its suspension design; the positioning of the medium-velocity 37 mm main armament in a limited-traverse hull mounting rather than a turret was short-sighted and quickly lost favour. The tank had no radio. Only 100 were built before Italy moved on to the M13/40. Twenty-four served, in 4-tank platoons, with the Medium Special Tank Company (Compagnia Speciale Carri M) in the East African Armored Task Force in Italian East Africa until the Italians there were defeated in June 1941. Another 70 were deployed with the 1st and 2nd Medium Tank Battalions, which deployed to Libya in summer, 1940, and were all either destroyed or captured by British forces by early February 1941.
