History of C13_T90: 
The OTO Melara C13 family of vehicles would begin development during the early 1980s. First officially announced in 1981 in many Italian military magazines, the C13 was specifically developed in the hopes for the Italian army to replace the several American M113 APCs they had in service. It was presented publicly in its basic version in 1982 as the first prototype armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun. This APC version would be able to carry 11 infantrymen and the driver, and would be powered by a Isotta-Fraschini supercharged diesel engine which produced 330 hp, it would also have a considerable top speed (60 km/h) for a vehicle of the era. It would also have a range of 500 km, which made it a very desirable vehicle for many nations that operated the M113 APC. Technically speaking, it could also be amphibious but to make it work, no form of turret was able to be installed so only the APC variant could cross bodies of water, it would be propelled similarly to the M113. It wouldn't be very armoured, but when compared to the M113 APC it did offer an improvement.
