History of 75/46_M43: 
The story of the Semovente M43 75/46 began during the late stages of the second world war. In mid-1942, the Italian Army put out a set of requirements for a new vehicle that could double up as both an infantry support vehicle as well as a tank destroyer, depending on the situation. In response to this, Fiat-Ansaldo and OTO Melara both began developing together prototypes around these requirements in parallel. The two competing designs primarily differed in the chassis choice. OTO picked the newer chassis of the P40 heavy tank whilst Fiat-Ansaldo chose to opt for a newer and larger version of the chassis already in production for their Semovente M42. This decision allowed Fiat-Ansaldo to complete their prototype much sooner. In February 1943, the Semovente 105/25 M43 was presented to military officials and was soon afterwards ordered into production, following successful trials. Production began in April 1943, with a planned production run of over 800 vehicles. However, with Italy's industry at this late stage of the war being severely crippled, production was slow and reaching such high production goals was more than unlikely. Just prior to the signing of the armistice in September, the 30th vehicle rolled off the assembly line. The Semovente 105/25 M43 proved itself in combat during the defence of Rome, where the SPGs successfully engaged German forces trying to retake the city. The 75/46 M43 is a further variant which was developed from the Italian Semovente 105/25. The main changes included improved armour to the vehicle, which greatly increased its surviability against allied tanks. Another change included the adoption of the German Pak 40 anti-tank gun in place of the original 105 mm howitzer.[1] Due end stages of the war, and the consistant bombardment of Italian factories and supply lines, it lead to the low production of the Italian-licensed version of the cannon. In the end only eleven 75/46 M43 were fully built, while others were outfitted with the available Italian 75 mm Ansaldo L/34 gun, leading to the production of the 75/34 M43 tank destroyer.
