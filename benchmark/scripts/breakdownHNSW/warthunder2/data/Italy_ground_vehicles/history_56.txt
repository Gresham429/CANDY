History of 2S1_(Italy): 
The 2S1 was used extensively by the Hungarian Army during the Cold War. These vehicles were produced in the USSR as Hungary did not possess the necessary equipment to produce these vehicles in large numbers. The 144 remaining 2S1s were phased out by the Hungarian army in 2004.
