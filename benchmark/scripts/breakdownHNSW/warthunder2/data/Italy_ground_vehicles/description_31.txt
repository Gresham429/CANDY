Description of Turan_II: 
The 41M Tur치n II was a Hungarian medium tank that was designed as an improvement over the 40M Tur치n I. It had a new turret, more armour, and a new 75 mm gun that was based on an old 18M 8 cm field gun, outsourced and modified by the Swedish company Bofors. Around 195 Tur치n IIs were built from 1942 to 1944, but due to delays in gun optics and ammunition, it only reached units in September 1943. The 41M Tur치n II saw action on the Eastern Front and in the defence of Hungary against the Soviet invasion. Although it was outmatched by the Soviet T-34s with their long 75 mm guns, it could still damage Soviet tanks within 500 m, which was better than its predecessor with only a 40 mm gun.
