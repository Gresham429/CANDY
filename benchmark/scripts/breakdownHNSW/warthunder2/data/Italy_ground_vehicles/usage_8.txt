Usage of AS_42: 
The main roles of the AS 42 are as an SPAA and as a scout car. When playing as an SPAA, position the vehicle in an open space to be able to detect aircraft from a distance, usually near your spawn point. You can move forward and stay close to your teammates to offer the best AA support, but be careful not to reveal yourself to enemy tanks. Engage approaching aircraft only under 1,000 m to increase your chances of hitting, and ideally within 500-700 m. Avoid being detected too early: your fire rate and clip size is poor for an AA gun, so you'll have to shoot precisely and make every shot count. Your vehicle's protection is non-existent: plan to have an obstacle nearby you can use as cover, and have an escape route ready.
