Description of L6/40_(31_Rgt.): 
The L6/40 is a tracked light tank made by Ansaldo for the Royal Italian army during the 1940s. The L6/40 was based on a heavily modified L3 chassis, keeping the two-person crew, but with an increase in firepower, protection, and mobility. This particular example of the L6/40 was used by the Italian 31st Regiment to counter guerrilla warfare in the Balkans, particularly in Albania between 1942 and 1943. These L6/40s would also provide protection to key infrastructure in captured Yugoslavian territory. The Italian army would operate up to 55 units of this vehicle in that theatre. Notably, this particular L6/40 tank bears a painted Lion emblem, which served as a symbolic mascot for the stationed troops. After the armistice, most of the units operating there would be taken by the German army.
