Usage of StuG_III_G_(Italy): 
The StuG III G is best played as a support vehicle. Like the previous Semovente variants, it has excellent armour and can be quite a potent vehicle that enemies will often find hard to deal with from long ranges. Due to this, it's advised to go to a good spot overlooking common enemy positions at the beginning of the match. Make sure enemies don't breach your defenses, as the sides of the tank are a weak point from any range. Another downside of playing this vehicle is when it's brought close to the front lines (for example when capturing points). The StuG III G's armour will not be adequate against the close-range power of most vehicles. Most shots at close range will more than likely penetrate the armour, which will usually result in the vehicle being destroyed due to the small interior layout. So it is vital to maintain situational awareness when playing in a more risky playstyle. Make sure to support teammates from the flanks, attack from long ranges, and never close in the distance even for objectives unless necessary. If properly concealed, the enemy will never know where they are attacked as they concentrate their assault forwards.
