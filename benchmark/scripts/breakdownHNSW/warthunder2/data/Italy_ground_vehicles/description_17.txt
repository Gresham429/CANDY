Description of M3A3_(Italy): 
The history of the American M3A3 Stuart in Italian service starts in the immediate aftermath of post-war Italy. Several re-armament programs, partially supported by America and the United Kingdom, allowed them to give away surplus military equipment away to nations who needed to bolster their forces. Italy received the vehicles in the form of the Military Assistance Program, and they would be in service in several armoured regiments for many decades. They were well-liked as the doctrine of the Italian army allowed for the Stuart to fit in nicely without too many issues, mainly thanks to its compact design which made it ideal for use in Italy. It was light but armoured enough to withstand hits from lower calibre rounds.
