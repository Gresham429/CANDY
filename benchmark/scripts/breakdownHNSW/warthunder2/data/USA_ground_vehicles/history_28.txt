History of M4A5: 
The aftermath of the Battle of France left the British military decimated as most of their equipment had to be left behind in their withdrawal at Dunkirk. Desperate for military equipment, particularly tanks, they requested from the U.S. to help produce the necessary vehicles to supplement the armoured forces. Canada further assisted the British with armoured vehicle production. The Canadian Pacific Railway's Angus Shops were contracted to build 300 Valentine tanks for the British, and later Canada themselves ordered 488 Valentines to build up their own tank forces. The Canadians realized that, in addition to the Valentines, they needed a cruiser tank to attack and exploit breakthroughs. Complications between adapting British designs to North American standards and the difference in material quality caused the Canadians to seek an American-derived cruiser tank rather than a British design.
