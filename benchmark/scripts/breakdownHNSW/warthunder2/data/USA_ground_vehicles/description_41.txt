Description of M4A3E2: 
The M4A3E2 Sherman - Assault Tank is an armoured modification of the M4A3, which is the fourth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. The U.S. Army decided in early 1944 that they needed an armoured version of a medium tank for an assault role in the forthcoming European Theatre of Operations (ETO). However, they had previously rejected proposals for such a vehicle, and time was running out. The decision was made to modify the newest standard U.S. Army medium tank of the time, the M4A3 Sherman, since the new T26E1-1 heavy tank prototype would not be ready in time and earlier designs had been completely inadequate for the role. The vehicle evolved into the M4A3E2 Sherman - Assault tank, sometimes known as the Sherman Jumbo. With only 254 units constructed, it constituted less than 1% of overall M4 Sherman production. However, its unique design made a lasting impression, making it one of the most widely recognized M4 Sherman variants. It should be emphasized that the term 'Jumbo' does not exist in any military material and is probably certainly a post-war nickname, possibly developed by a model organization. An extra 38 mm of armour plate was to be welded to the upper hull front and sides of the M4A3 variant, bringing the overall thickness to 101 mm on the front and 76 mm on the sides. The back upper hull and top, as well as the lower hull, remained unmodified. The turret was based on the T23 turret and had a similar interior arrangement as well as a complete basket, however, the pistol port was removed. The thickness was about 152 mm all around, however, it reduced to 63 mm at the back below the bulge. The 75 mm M3 tank gun was mounted in a modified M62 Gun mount designed for the 76 mm M1 tank gun. The M62's original 50 mm cast gun shield was reinforced with an additional 127 mm armour plate, resulting in a massive mantlet that covered over three-quarters of the turret front.
