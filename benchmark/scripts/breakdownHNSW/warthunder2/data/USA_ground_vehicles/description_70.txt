Description of T29: 
The Heavy Tank T29 is a premium gift rank IV American heavy tank 
with a battle rating of 7.0 (AB/RB) and 6.7 (SB). The T29 was introduced in the Update 1.59 "Flaming Arrows" as a gift vehicle and was available on the Gaijin store as a pre-order pack before the update. The T29 is a formidable heavy tank that introduces the 105 mm T5 cannon in a rotating turret rather than in the fixed case-mate setting like the T95, with a tougher-than-average gun mantlet, and a sloped, but slightly thin hull.
