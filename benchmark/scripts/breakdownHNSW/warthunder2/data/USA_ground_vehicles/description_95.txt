Description of M247: 
The M247 Sergeant York Division Air Defense (DIVAD) was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun developed by Ford Aerospace in the late 1970s. A new turret with twin 40 mm M266 Bofors autocannons guided by radar has been fitted, using the chassis of the M48 Patton main battle tank. The vehicle bears the name of the well-known World War I soldier, Sergeant Alvin York. Although numerous off-the-shelf technologies were used to facilitate quick and inexpensive development, several technical issues and significant cost overruns led to the project's cancellation in 1985. A total of just 50 units were manufactured.
