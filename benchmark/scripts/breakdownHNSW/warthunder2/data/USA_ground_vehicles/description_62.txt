Description of M56: 
After World War II, the US Airborne units sought ways to improve their anti-tank firepower to defend against enemy armour attack after an airdrop. As the design must be lightweight for airborne purposes, it must contain the most firepower possible on a mobile platform. This translated into the installment of a 90 mm M54 gun onto a small tracked chassis. This small vehicle was accepted for service in 1958 as the M56, or by its nickname "Scorpion". 150 units would be produced by Cadillac Motor Division and saw combat service in the Vietnam War.
