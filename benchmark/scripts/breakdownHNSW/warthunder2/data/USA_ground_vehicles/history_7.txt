History of M13_MGMC: 
The changing concept of warfare ever since aircraft were introduced into combat led to the role of the anti-aircraft. As such, the US Army submitted a request for the development of a mobile anti-aircraft vehicle to defend themselves against enemy aircraft. Development didn't start until October 1940 to build such a vehicle, with the purpose to protect mechanized troops from airstrikes. The first build up was a 4x4 truck with an anti-aircraft armament of two .50 cal M2 Browning machine guns, this was called the T1. The development went on with T1E1 with a Bendix mount on an M2 half-track car and the T1E2 with the Maxson mount. T1E3 had an electro-dynamic aircraft turret made for bombers from the Glenn L. Martin Company. Of these three, the T1E2 was selected for further development. The turret design on the T1E2 was placed onto the longer M3 half-track for more ammunition storage. This design, known as the T1E4, was accepted into service as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage on July 27, 1942. A total of 1,103 units were produced from that day until May 15, 1943, though about 583 units were converted to the M16 MGMC before being delivered. First deliveries came in late 1943.
