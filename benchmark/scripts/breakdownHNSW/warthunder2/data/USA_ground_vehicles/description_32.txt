Description of LVT(A)(4)_(ZIS-2)_(USA): 
The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked, Armoured, Mark 4, 57 mm ZiS-2 - LVT(A)(4)(ZiS-2) is an up-gunned modification of the LVT(A)(4), which is the fourth armoured, infantry support variant of theÂ Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked - LVT. The LVT(A)(4)(ZiS-2) was modified by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was based on the LVT(A)(4). During the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Nationalist Army deployed a large number of LVT(4)s and LVT(A)(4)s. Following the defeat of the Chinese Nationalist Army in 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army captured many of the LVT(4)s and LVT(A)(4)s. The Chinese People's Liberation Army removed the original turret mounting the 75 mm M2 howitzer and replaced it with the high-velocity 57 mm ZIS-2 anti-tank gun for dual anti-tank and infantry support purposes after the US stopped supplying ammunition for the original LVT(A)(4) to China after the Chinese Civil War ended.
