Usage of M47: 
The M47 is very much a glass cannon. With a powerful gun, but weak armour, this vehicle should be played carefully, and out of sight of the enemy. As such, it is often beneficial to use an ambush or flanking-based playstyle. Attacking enemies without being seen will maximize this tank's capabilities.
