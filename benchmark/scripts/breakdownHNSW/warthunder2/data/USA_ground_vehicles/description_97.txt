Description of M60A2: 
In the Cold War arms race for tank armaments, the US picked up an interest in developing an anti-tank guided missile as the main armament for tanks. As the M60 was coming into service, development started to create an ATGM armament for the tank with the goal of putting it into service by 1965. This developed into a 152 mm gun/launcher system that could fire conventional rounds or a Shillelagh missile system. Enthusiastic with the new weapon system, the US Army aims to have the weapon equip both their newest airborne reconnaissance and assault vehicle and their main battle tanks. As a way to upgrade the existing M60 fleet with the new weapon system, the M60A1 would be converted to equip the weapon. A modified turret was provided to equip the gun/launcher system, however the US Army's dream of a simple transition into the weapon system was trashed when complications with the system arose, especially in regards to the sensitive ammunition. While a limited production run was allowed with the tank designated as the M60A2, but continued trouble with the tank and poor troop reception led to the M60A2's phasing out with only 526 units produced.
