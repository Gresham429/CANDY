Description of Merkava_Mk.3D_(USA): 
The Merkava Mk.3D is the third and last subvariant of the Merkava Mk.3, which is the third variant of the Merkava main battle tank family. The tank, also known as the Merkava 3 Dor-Dalet (Hebrew for "Fourth Generation"), was enhanced by adding fourth-generation modular composite armour to the turret sides. These sloped modules also function as spaced armour, providing greater protection in urban settings. The Dor-Dalet modular composite armour is extremely similar to the Merkava Mk.4 variant and provides significantly more protection than the preceding Merkava Mk.3s. The tracks were additionally strengthened with a new version supplied by CAT. The Merkava Mk.3D was first used by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in 2000.
