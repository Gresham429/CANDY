Description of LVT(A)(4): 
The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked, Armoured, Mark 4 - LVT(A)(4) is the fourth armoured, infantry support variant of the Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked (LVT) family. The 37 mm M6 tank gun of the LVT(A)(1) was deemed insufficient for fire support by the U.S. Marines, thus the turret of the 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 (HMC), also known as the M8 "Scott", was modified to produce the LVT(A)(4). A 12.7 mm M2HB Browning heavy machine gun was mounted on the ring mount above the turret's rear. The two 7.62 mm M1919A4 light machine guns mounted on ring mounts on the aft deck behind the turret were removed. During World War II, a total of 1,890 units were built. The U.S. Army received 1,307 units, the British Army received 50, and the remaining units were used by the U.S. Marines.
