History of T29: 
Projects for a dedicated heavy tank for the U.S. Armed Forces began in March 1944 as a response to the German heavy tanks that have been popping up in Europe. While the T26E3 tank, later known as the M26 Pershing was slated to be the next-generation American tank, it was still considered unsuitable against the even heavier Tiger II. A project to increase the armour and firepower commenced countering this problem, the project titled Heavy Tank T29. Using design elements from the T26E3 with thicker armour and lengthened hull, the T29 also was equipped with the 105 mm Gun T5, a gun in development alongside the heavy assault tank T95. Other features included a 770 hp Ford GAC engine, armour thickness up to 279 mm effective, and a coincidence range-finder. The heavy armour and armament made the tank weigh about 64 tons, making it a close match to the Tiger II.
