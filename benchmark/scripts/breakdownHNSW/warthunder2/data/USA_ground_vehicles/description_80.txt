Description of M163: 
The US short-range air defence in the early stages of the Vietnam War consisted of the M42 Dusters, however the fast-paced nature of fighter jets meant that the low rate of fire the 40 mm Bofors provide was no longer sufficient. To improve on this, the 20 mm Vulcan cannon used on American jets was utilized as the basis of the new short-range air defence gun, modified into the M168 gun. Installed onto the common M113 chassis with a tracking radar, the design became known as the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS). The M163 remained in use with the US military until replaced with systems that utilized the FIM-92 Stinger like the Avenger.
