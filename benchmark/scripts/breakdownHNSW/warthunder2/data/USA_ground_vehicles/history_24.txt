History of M4A3_(105): 
The M4 Sherman were originally equipped with the 75 mm M3 cannon. Though the 75 mm was thought to be an overall effective gun, certain situations called for more destructive power. Enter the 105 mm M4 Howitzer, a mountable artillery piece for a tank. The army decided to arm the Shermans with these artillery pieces for a radical increase in explosive power. The first of its model was a M4A2 Sherman with its turret mounting the formidable cannon in the M52 mount, these Shermans were designated M4(105) and were accepted into service in February 1944. Later, M4A3 Shermans were also being converted into 105 mm with the name M4A3(105) When the HVSS was developed for the M4 Shermans by mean of the M4A3E8, the same was applied to the M4s with the 105 mm because of its increased weight, so an improved suspension would increase mobility. These Shermans were then designated to M4(105) HVSS or M4A3(105) HVSS and remained that way to the end of the war. The 105 mm Shermans were produced by Chrysler Corporation at the Detroit Tank Arsenal. 800 M4(105) and 841 M4(105) HVSS were produced from February 1944 to March 1945, and 500 M4A3(105) and 2539 M4A3(105) HVSS were produced in May 1944 to June 1945. This brings a total of 4680 Shermans with the 105 mm howitzer as its main armament during its production time.
