Description of M1A1_Click-Bait: 
One of the primary M1A1 variants used by the USMC (US Marine Corps) was the HC, or Heavy Common variant. The biggest upgrade this variant has is the AN/VLQ-8A Softkill APS system mounted on the roof, which no other mainline Abrams variants get. One such example of the M1A1HC is the real tank named "Click-Bait". The tank was made somewhat notorious in online circles after an image of the tank with a plastic lawn chair surfaced on the internet during one of its combat deployments.
