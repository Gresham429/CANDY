History of T25: 
After the M4 Sherman was adopted as the United States military's standard tank, work began on a new tank design to be the successor of the M4 Sherman. U.S. Ordnance Department got to work in spring of 1942, which would lead up to the T20 tank designs. The T20, along with its variants like the T22 and T23, were all marginal improvements over the M4 Sherman with a more powerful 76 mm M1 gun, a rear transmission design, and having a much lower profile. While the Ordnance Dept. tinkered around with these designs with various components, the Armored Board rejected the few designs offered to them for being maintenance extensive, as well as not seeing a need to replace their abundant and well-suited M4 Shermans on the field. While the tanks were rejected, they did provide some technical upgrades to the current Sherman designs. An example of this is the horizontal-volute suspension system (HVSS)that eventually became the suspension of the "E8" Shermans  such as the M4A3E8.[1] Another example is the T23 turret, which would become the main turret on Shermans mounting the 76 mm cannon on the "E6" program.
