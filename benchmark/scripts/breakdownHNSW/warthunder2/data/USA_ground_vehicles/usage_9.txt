Usage of M2A2: 
The M2A2 is a strange vehicle as a twin-turreted machine-gun armament only vehicle. It is, however, fast, and could be sped around as a scout tank to get on the enemy's side. Your main turret, which uses 12.7 mm (.50) MG  can only fire forward and to the left, with secondary turret (which sports standard 7.62 mm (.30) MG, which can only really scare SPAA trucks) firing to the right. Additionally, the M2A2 has a working hull machine gun, but it is fixed to the hull and angled up so its usefulness is extremely limited.
