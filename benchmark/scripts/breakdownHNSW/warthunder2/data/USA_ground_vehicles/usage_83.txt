Usage of M728_CEV: 
The M728 CEV has a very unique role in combat due to its high survivability and low-velocity gun. The M782 performs best in urban or mountainous locations as it has heavy armour in the right places to survive high intensity engagements and its gun can decimate almost every tank you will encounter at its BR with a well-placed shot. On maps with larger open areas, it is best to either stay back and try to play as artillery, although this will require a good feel for the shells' trajectory, or rush in as close as possible, tanking sniper shots on your armour as you close the distance to wreck havoc.
