Description of AGS: 
The usage of the M551 Sheridan airborne/reconnaissance tank in combat in places like Vietnam enabled the United States to gather experience on what they like or didn't like about the lightweight armored vehicles in combat operations. This allowed the United States to establish the baseline requirements when opening the Armored Gun System (AGS) program to find a replacement to the M551 for their airborne forces. One contender in this contest was Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM), which produced their own AGS design in the early 1980s. Their design was submitted and was distinguished for its unmanned turret when compared to competitors like the CCVL. However, the CCVL ended up winning the AGS program and the TCM AGS design was not adopted. TCM continued to utilize their AGS design for export sales attempt after the program's conclusion.
