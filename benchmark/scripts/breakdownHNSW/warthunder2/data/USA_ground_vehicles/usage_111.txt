Usage of LAV-AD: 
In battles, the player can either use the LAV-AD as an AA or in a limited anti-tank role. By using the LAV's fast speed, the player can easily reach deep into enemy territory where enemies are less vigilant compared to when they're near the frontline. The player can use this advantage by either hiding and waiting for planes to be distracted on friendly tanks and shooting them down or used to attack unsuspecting SPAAs and IFVs/light tanks from mid range and then closing up close to killing MBTs. The rocket pod makes quick work of enemy armour if you can get on their flanks. Additionally, the LAV's fast speed makes for a decent distraction against enemies while your teammates destroy them.
