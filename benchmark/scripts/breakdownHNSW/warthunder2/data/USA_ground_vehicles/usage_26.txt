Usage of Stuart_VI_(5th_CAD)_(USA): 
Like all early American tanks in early ranks, this tank works best from a distance where its armour can shine and its gun can provide fast covering fire. However, this tank also works well in tight spaces if the armour is angled correctly, thanks to is the ability to bounce shots and snipe enemy crew with its AP ammunition.
