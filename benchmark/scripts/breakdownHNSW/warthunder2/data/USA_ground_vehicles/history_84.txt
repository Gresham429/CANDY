History of Magach_3_(ERA)_(USA): 
During the 1960s and '70s, Israel purchased a number of M48 and M60 tanks from West Germany and later the USA. These tanks and their subsequent upgraded versions were named Magach. The first two Magach tanks were for the most part "stock" versions Israel initially received, without any significant retrofits. However, the first wave of major upgrades became visible with the Magach 3. This version intended to upgrade the Israeli M48s to the A4 standard, following the Six-Day-War of 1967. The Magach 3 introduced several major improvements over the previous versions, including the replacement of the 90 mm with the L7 105 mm cannon, an improved diesel engine and transmission as well as a low-profile commanders cupola, just to name a few.
