History of M60_AMBT: 
In 2011, the Turkish company StandartBio proposed a large-scale modernization program for outdated M60 tanks. The program was called the Affordable Main Battle Tank (AMBT) and was aimed to increase combat effectiveness of M60 tanks to a level roughly equivalent to modern main battle tanks. The main changes of this modernization were a new 1200 hp diesel engine, a modern fire control system with a ballistic computer and independent stabilization of the aiming line through a digital gunner's sight, as well as a new smooth-bore M256 120-mm gun. The tank's protection also increased slightly by installing solid hull side screens and tower slat screens. In addition, the tank received an electric turret drive, new surveillance optics, and a 25-mm automatic cannon in the commander's turret. The AMBT modernization program was designed entirely for foreign operators of the M60 from several countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
