History of T55E1: 
The Cook Brothers Equipment Company designed an experimental 8x8 wheeled desert vehicle which a prototype of was completed by 1942, according to photographic evidence. The vehicle used a chain drive, and the wheels were set up in two 4x4 bogies, each with it's own engine. The desert vehicle was used as the basis of a wheeled tank destroyer after they received a contract from the US Army in August 1942. One prototype was built by the Allied Machinery Manufacturing Company and was called the T55 GMC (GMC standing for Gun Motor Carriage). The T55 had the front engine moved to the rear of the hull in order to fit the main armament, a 3 inch or 76.2 mm M7 gun, at the front of the hull. After initial testing of the T55 GMC in December 1942, the Cook Brothers were requested by the Army to design an improved version.
