History of T26E1-1: 
The M26 Pershing helped the American armoured forces by bringing the 90 mm Gun M3 into service on a tank mount, as opposed to the M36 which entered service prior to the M26, but was not considered a tank by the US Army. The gun was similar in performance to the German's Tiger Is 8.8 cm KwK36 cannon, but Army Ordnance wanted something to match the more powerful 8.8 cm KwK43 cannon on the Tiger II. The development to match this cannon made the T15 90 mm gun. The gun was 73 calibres long, compared to the 90 mm Gun M3's 53 calibre length. The first produced guns were called the T15E1 and had large, fixed ammunition. To test the gun's viability in the tank, the gun was mounted onto the very first production T26, T26E1 tank serial #1, registration #0103292, with the conversions being done by the Wellman Engineering Company. This upgraded tank was titled the T26E1-1 by means of a painted-on designation on the turret's left side to distinguish the design, although this title was not official, and few if any sources refer to it as such. The extreme length of the T15E1 gun barrel caused the manufacturers to add a very prominent counter balance on the mantlet, which could be seen on the left side of the turret when facing it. The T26E1-1 tank was sent to Aberdeen Proving Grounds on 12 January 1945 for testing purposes.[1]
