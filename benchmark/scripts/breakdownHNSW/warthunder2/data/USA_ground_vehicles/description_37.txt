Description of M4A2_(76)_W: 
The M4A2 (76) W Sherman was the second variant of the late-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. It was outfitted with a modified T23 turret which accommodated the M1 tank gun, giving it a total length of 7.57 m (25 feet). The range was 161 km (100 miles) with the GM 6046 diesel engine which held approximately 673 litres (178 gallons) of fuel. The total weight increased to 33.3 tons. The upper glacis was 108 mm (4.25 inches) thick and sloped at 47Â°, with huge hatches. Many M4A2 (76) Ws were supplied to the USSR for the Soviet Army as part of the World War II lend-lease program (mainly because it had a diesel engine like most Soviet Army tanks). The engine, which was powered by the same General Motors 6046 twin diesel as the M4A2, was reliable as well as easy to maintain. Until May 1945, around 3,230 M4A2 (76) Ws units were delivered.
