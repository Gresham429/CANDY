Usage of M1A1_HC: 
The M1A1 HC is essentially the M1A2 without the CITV but with a soft-kill active protection system (APS) that is only useful against early missiles but useless against laser-guided missiles like Hellfires or Vikhrs. The M1A1 HC also has good acceleration which allows for flanking manoeuvres. Due to its increased turret protection and better APFSDS round, it is also suited for sniping at long ranges especially when hull down. With a higher BR than its predecessor, it faces tanks that have no problem penetrating its hull necessitating proper utilization of hard cover found in maps. Its M829A1 round allows it to more comfortably engage targets at range and penetrate armour more reliably up close.
