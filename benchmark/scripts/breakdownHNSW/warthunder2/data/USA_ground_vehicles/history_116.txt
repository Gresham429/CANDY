History of M1A1_AIM: 
The Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) had been a long time user of European tanks including British Centurions and German Leopard AS1s. However, the Royal Australian Army opted to purchase M1A1s from from the United States as the replacement of Leopards in July 2007.[1] These 59 M1A1 AIM have their DU armour removed to comply with the Non-Proliferation Treaty and were deployed in the RAAC as their new generation MBT. These tanks were planned to be upgraded in the late 2010s, and later plans include building 75 M1A2 Sep v.3 domestically with a non-DU armour package specifically for Australia by 2024 to replace these 59 M1A1 AIMs.
