History of IPM1: 
With the cancellation of the MBT-70/XM-803 program in 1971, a new program to research and create prototypes for a main battle tank was created in 1972 known as the Main Battle Tank Task Force (MBTTF) at Fort Knox. General Motors and Chrysler were eventually selected to submit drafts and designs and by the end of 1973 there were scale mock-ups of the XM1 prototypes. The design was featured around the previously used 105 mm M68 gun along with a high powered engine for increased mobility.[1] It was decided to explore new types of composite armour, and the Chobham armour being developing in Britain at the time was examined although it was not used in the XM1 prototypes.[2] The XM1 was tested in 1976, and by the end of the year Chrysler was chosen to create extensive engineering test vehicles.[3]
