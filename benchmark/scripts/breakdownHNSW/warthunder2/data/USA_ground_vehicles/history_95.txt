History of M247: 
The M247 "Sergeant York" was designed in the late 1970's as a purpose-built SPAAG. It was designed to fight alongside the M1 Abrams and M2/M3 Bradley, in order to provide cover against aircraft. There were other SPAA vehicles in service at the time; these were the M163 Vulcan and the MIM-72/M48 Chaparral. The former being a 20 mm rotary cannon mounted on an armoured personnel carrier, and the latter being a heavily modified armoured personnel carrier chassis with a surface-to-air missile launcher. Neither of those two vehicles were designed as SPAA's, and so, did not have the necessary performance to be adequate at their job. The M247 was designed as a replacement for both of the previous vehicles.
