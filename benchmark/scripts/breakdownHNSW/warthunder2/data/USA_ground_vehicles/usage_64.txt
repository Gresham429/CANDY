Usage of Super_Hellcat: 
The Super Hellcat should be very familiar to those who play the M18 GMC. It is very fast, equipped with a hard-hitting cannon, but at a cost of armour. Thus, the M18 Super Hellcat is a mobile hit-and-run vehicle, popping out from behind a cover and blasting the enemy with a shot before retreating. Change up the firing location often to avoid being hit if someone has located the Super Hellcat's position. The Hellcat won't hold the line by standing and absorbing shots, but it can if it is picking off each attacker one by one like a sniper.
