Description of XM975: 
The Carrier Air Defense Missile System XM975 is a U.S. self-propelled missile defence (SAM) system based on the French Roland ground-to-air missile that was constructed on the Tracked Carrier - XM975. The U.S. Army evaluated the Roland missile system in the 1970s and early 1980s. The Roland ground-to-air missile launcher was mounted on the Tracked Carrier - XM975 (a weapon-tracked carrier that was also utilized on the M109 self-propelled howitzer). Overall, this SAM system had limited service, with only one prototype manufactured and approximately 27 units produced in total. It served in the U.S. Army for about 5 to 10 years before being phased out.
