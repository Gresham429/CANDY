Usage of M1128: 
The M1128 is best played as an ambush-sniper. Take full advantage of the vehicle's mobility to get to sniping positions first and avoid open areas when you can. With the M1128's unmanned turret, it is best used at a hull-down position. The M1128 is also vulnerable to the overpressure mechanic and has inconsistent and poor armour which means that you should approach all enemies with caution. When the opportunity presents itself, it is always best to double back or reposition and fight your enemy in a position fight.
