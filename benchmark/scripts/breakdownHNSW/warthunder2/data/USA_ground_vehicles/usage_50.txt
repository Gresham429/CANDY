Usage of Cobra_King: 
The Cobra King is best in assaulting enemy positions with allies. Its great mobility for a heavy tank, especially with its armour, makes it a vehicle able to charge into battle with confidence. It can act as a bullet magnet against enemy tanks more worried about the Cobra King, diverting fire that would have been directed more vulnerable teammates. Though the 75 mm gun's AP performance is not suited to the types of enemies expected at the BR, it can still harass enemies and the gun is lethal enough that enemies will be forced to show their front armour towards the Jumbo else a 75 mm penetrates their side armour. Their focus on the Jumbo can allow allies to move around and eliminate them. During all this, take care not to over-angle and show the lower side armour too much as this allows vehicles to penetrate down there and damage modules, even the ammunition storage if they are lucky.
