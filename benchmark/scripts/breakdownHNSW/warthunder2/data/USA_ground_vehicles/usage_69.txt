Usage of T28: 
When playing the Super Heavy T28, you will immediately notice the slow speed, as well as its odd-looking appearance. The front is very heavily armoured, with negligible armour around the sides, the rear and roof, which makes it an easy target for an artillery strike. There are two ways to play this tank: defensively or offensively, as each playstyle will have some positives and negatives.
