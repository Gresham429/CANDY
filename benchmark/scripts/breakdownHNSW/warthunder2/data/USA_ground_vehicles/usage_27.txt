Usage of Grant_I_(USA): 
The multiple cannons allow for different combinations of attack. The 75 mm gun possesses armour penetration on about the level of the 37 mm gun; however, the damage upon penetration is extremely high with the M61 APCBC shell due to the HE filler. On the other hand, the 37 mm gun allows for close quarters and longer-range fighting, where its high-velocity and effective shell make for good long range targeting while it is also the only cannon on the Grant that has a full 360-degree traverse.
