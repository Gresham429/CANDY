Description of Calliope: 
The Rocket Launcher T34 (Calliope) was a special modification of the second variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. The U.S. Ordnance Department initiated a series of projects experimenting with the attachment of rocket launchers to the M4 Sherman, in order to provide enhanced firepower to its infantry. Despite the fact that its 75 mm M3 tank gun was capable of firing very efficient ammunition, it was unable to handle massive waves of assaulting enemies. Furthermore, it was also insufficient against the Germans' heavily entrenched strongholds. Although not as precise as traditional artillery, rockets can cover a bigger area in less time with explosives and shrapnel, saturating a target in seconds. Rockets also have a negative psychological impact on enemies under rocket attack because of the howling sounds they make as they fly through the air. The most renowned of these tank-mounted rocket launchers was the Rocket Launcher T34, which was called "Calliope" after the Steam Organ due to the deafening roar that burst from the tubes when the rockets were fired.
