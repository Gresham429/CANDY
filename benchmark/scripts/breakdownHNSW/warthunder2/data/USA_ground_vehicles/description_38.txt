Description of M4A3_(76)_W: 
The M4A3 (76) W HVSS Sherman is a derivative of the third variant of the late-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. A famous derivative from the M4A3 (76) W, the main modification was the incorporation of the HVSS (Horizontal Volute Spring Suspension) system. The HVSS was developed in response to issues with the older VVSS (Vertical Volute Spring Suspension), which had been installed on all other early and late-production M4 Sherman variants. The M4A3 (76) W HVSS, also known as the M4A3E8 or "Easy Eight" when it was first produced by the Detroit Arsenal factory, had the same 47Â° sloped hull's upper front armour plate with large hatches, "wet" ammo bins, full up-armoured sides, HVSS, and a revised T23 turret with the 76 mm M1 tank gun with muzzle brake. In World War II, the M4A3 (76) W saw combat in the final stages of the fight in Europe and the Pacific. The M4A3 (76) W HVSS remained in service long after World War II, serving in Korea, Vietnam, and a variety of other foreign militaries.
