Description of T114: 
As part of the development of a lightweight armored vehicle that would become the M113, the T114 design was considered for the role of a infantry battalion antitank (BAT) weapon system with the mounting of a 106 mm M40A1 recoilless rifle. The 106 mm M40A1 was mounted in a turret with a three-round magazine and a semiautomatic loader. Two prototypes were built and began testing in December 1960 and continued until January 1961. However, in March 1961, it was decided that the anti-tank carrier version of the T114 (BAT) was no longer necessary and development should focus on making the T114 into a command and reconnaissance vehicle (which would become the M114 CRV).
