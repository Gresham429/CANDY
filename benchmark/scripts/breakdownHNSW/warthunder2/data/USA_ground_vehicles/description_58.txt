Description of T26E5: 
The success and popularity of the M4A3E2 "Jumbo" tanks in combat led to a similar undertaking for the M26 Pershing tank. Conversions started in January 1945 with M26 prototypes modified with heavier armour in the turret and hull into the T26E5. While the heavier weight strained the suspension, the performance was considered favorable. However, the end of World War II led to the necessity of these tanks to disappear, with only 27 T26E5 produced by the war's end for testing.
