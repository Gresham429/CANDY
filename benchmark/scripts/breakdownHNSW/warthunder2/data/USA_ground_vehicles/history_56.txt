History of M46: 
At the end of World War II, the US Army's most modern tank design was the M26 Pershing heavy tank. The M26 was remarkably better than the M4A3 (76) W HVSS Sherman tank in terms of armour and gun, but was deficient in engine power as it was around ten tons heavier than the M4A3, but retained the same 500 horsepower Ford engine.[1] When tank production was halted in October 1945, the US Army had 2,212 M26s in inventory.[2] As the US Army reorganized and specified their needs for the post war period, which included the reclassification of the M26 from a heavy tank to a medium tank in May 1946,[2] the US Army sought the procurement of new tanks to make up the post-war tank fleet. However, the demilitarization and budget cuts with World War II's end heavily constrained the US Army's tank development and procurement programs. Stuck with what they had, the US Army began looking into modernizing the M26s to turn them into their desired postwar tank.[1]
