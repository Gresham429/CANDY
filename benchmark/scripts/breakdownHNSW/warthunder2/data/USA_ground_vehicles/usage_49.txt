Usage of T55E1: 
You should use the T55 as a flanking vehicle or sniper at the beginning of the match. Your speed outclasses other vehicles and you can use it to get to a flanking position or a sniping point before anyone else. Then use your gun's excellent angles to aim at a place where you can see the enemy's side. As mentioned above, try to avoid MG fire and if you can. It is not recommended to shoot on the move as you will tend to miss your shots.
