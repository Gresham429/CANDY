Description of T55E1: 
As America searched for their ideal tank destroyer vehicle, evaluation of a "Cook Interceptor" 8x8 vehicle proved to be successful enough to be considered for a tank destroyer variant holding a 3-inch gun. Initially produced in November 1942 as the 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage T55, the test results and requirements were incorporated into the design of the second unit. The second unit was produced in April 1943 as the 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage T55E1. While the wheeled performance was considered satisfactory, the vehicle's mobility was unsatisfactory against the requirement that the vehicle be as mobile and manoeuvrable as a tank. The vehicle was not accepted into service and was sent to Aberdeen Proving Grounds in August 1943.
