Usage of M26_T99: 
Even being designated as a medium, the Pershing can perform in many different roles in battle. It can be used for supporting allied tanks with long reload time as IS-2s, T32s, etc. Participate in flanking manoeuvres — the M26 speed and agility is not brilliant but enough for that — and be successful in sniping and ambushing situations. Use the lower profile of Pershing compared to the Sherman's to navigate through. The vertical guidance (-10°/20°) allows the M26 to shoot from upper positions without exposing too much of the tank. That's an advantage compared to Russians which have many ground depression problems.
