Usage of T14: 
This is an assault tank, and therefore a brawler. Its 75 mm gun has a quick reload and the armour is good enough to bounce most shots. With its stabilizer, it also allows for fire-on-the-move and perform short stops around corners to blast the enemy. The APHE shells decimate Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, but if not angled the Panzer IV will go straight through the upper glacis plate and do the same to the T14.
