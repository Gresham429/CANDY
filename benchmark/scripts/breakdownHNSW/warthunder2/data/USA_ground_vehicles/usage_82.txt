Usage of T114: 
This tanks playstyle is similar to a role of a light tank, with only two crew, very light armour, only equipped with a 106 mm (10.6 cm) Recoilless Rifle armed with High-Explosive Anti-Tank grenade (similar to an RPG). However, it is just as deadly as any other tank on the battlefield!
