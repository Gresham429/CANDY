Usage of LOSAT: 
The LOSAT is a very quick and agile vehicle. Although it boasts very little armour, its armament is exceptional. The MGM-166 is small propelled dart which does more damage the further it travels. The LOSAT has a very simple playstyle: use it in long range engagements, roughly at 1,500 or more metres. This will allow the ammunition to speed up to its full potential dealing extreme amounts of penetration as much as 729 mm on a standard vehicle regardless of the angle and direction. It is recommended to snipe with the vehicle across maps. Simply position somewhere and let loose with your supersonic weapons.
