Usage of M60A1_(AOS): 
The M60A1 (AOS) performs similarly to the earlier M60, but with a number of differences. With the add-on stabilizer (AOS), the M60A1 is capable of firing on the move, allowing it to engage enemies much quicker and without having to stop the vehicle first. Overall, the gun handling of the M60A1 (AOS) is quite respectable. The turret traverse is good (although not outstanding) and the stabilizer allows firing on the move and much greater reactionary ability. The only letdown in this regard is the gun's elevation speed, which is slow but not exceptionally so. Just be aware that elevating or depressing the gun to get it on target may take more time than expected.
