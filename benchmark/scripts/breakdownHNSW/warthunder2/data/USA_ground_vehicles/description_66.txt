Description of M26E1: 
When the M26 Pershing was developed, it was already recognized to be lacking in comparable firepower to the German counterparts, which had the long-barreled 88 mm KwK 43 cannon on the Tiger II tanks. The US attempted to remedy this issue with the 90 mm T15 cannon with the T26E4 tanks, but these were considered cumbersome due to their extremely large cartridges, hindering the reload process within the tank. Further development led to the 90 mm T54 cannon, which had comparable firepower to the T15 cannon, but with a smaller ammunition for easier reloading within the tank. This new gun was installed into a prototype designated M26E1, however the post-war environment in terms of budget cuts and lack of need to produce new tanks led to the project's discontinuation and none of the tanks were considered.
