Usage of LVT(A)(4): 
The LVT(A)(4) is a fantastic fighting vehicle, it has a powerful 75 mm cannon attached to an LVT chassis is a great platform to fire on and giving its high profile, it is well built to fire over walls and other impediments. It is easy to hide the hull on some maps, like Abandoned Factory or Poland. One of the biggest issues, however, is that the vehicle is very easy to destroy with overpressure, so be very wary of vehicles firing powerful HE or HEAT shells such as the Spj fm/43-44 or the Sturmpanzer II, because if they get a shot off on your tank it will be destroyed. However, with the .50 cal machine gun, if enemies miss or do not destroy your vehicle, you can fire off a few bursts and destroy their vehicles.
