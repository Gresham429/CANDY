Description of T18E2: 
With the British seeking new armoured cars, the US Ordnance Corps issued specifications for a heavily armoured car. Delivered in 1942 by the Yellow Coach Company, the armoured car that would be the T18 was a heavy 8x8 suspension armoured car armed with a 37 mm anti-tank cannon. The 37 mm was not considered effective by the time, so the design was improved to the T18E2 variant with a 57 mm anti-tank cannon. However, the heavy armoured car's heavy weight and consequential mobility disadvantages, as well as its expensive price, led to a declining interest in the T18E2. As such, only a limited number was built and transferred to the British, which used them in limited fashion during the North Africa campaign.
