Usage of T26E5: 
The T26E5 is a heavy tank and should be played like one: stick with allies and move slowly. It is best used in positions that have concealment, this allows you to get the first shot off. When in positions with cover, you should wait for enemies to come to you. Generally, the better the position the better the tank will perform. Its armour can defend against some of the MBTs of the BR, but do not rely on it, and in uptiers it can struggle when against better rounds. It's best to try and cover your flank, as pretty much any round at the BR will penetrate your sides. This can be done by having teammates nearby, or a good position. In close range situations, it would be best to use the M82 round, but it must be aimed well. When it hits weak spots, the explosive filler is large enough to take out several crew members. If not, it can bounce easily against sloped armour. For medium and longer ranges, the M304 round will work better, but you will have to aim at specific components within the tank, as the APCR round does not inflict as much post-penetration damage as the M82 round.
