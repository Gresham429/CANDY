Usage of M13_MGMC: 
With the M13, the armour is very thin, and the lack of sloping makes the M13 an extremely easy target. Therefore, rely on the exceptional maneuverability, handling, and speed to either stay in cover or flank weaker tanks. Always relocate when faced with an artillery barrage as the shells will tear the thinly-armoured vehicle apart.
