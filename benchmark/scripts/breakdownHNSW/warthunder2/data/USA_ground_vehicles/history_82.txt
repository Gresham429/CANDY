History of T114: 
In the early 1950s, the US Army started work on developing a new generation of lightly-armoured vehicles, such as APCs. General Motor's Cadillac division proposed two versions of their T114 armoured vehicle to support infantry and anti-tank battalions, respectively. One version would to be armed with a single high calibre machine gun in a full rotatable turret, which would support the infantry battalions, whilst the other would be equipped with a 106mm recoilless gun, serving among the ranks of anti-tank battalions. In 1960, six prototypes of the T114 were built; four armed with machine guns and two armed with the recoilless gun, the latter being named BAT (Battalion Anti-tank) for a short period of time.
