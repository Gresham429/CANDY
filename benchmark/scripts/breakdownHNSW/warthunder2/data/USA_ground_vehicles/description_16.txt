Description of M8_LAC: 
Developed in 1941 as a candidate for the role of a mobile tank destroyer vehicle, the M8 was found to be more ideal in the reconnaissance role for the US armored force, cavalry, and tank destroyer branches. Initially designated as the T22, the car was accepted into service in June 22, 1942 as the "Light Armored Car, M8", and would have the nickname "Greyhound" from the British. It would begin production in March 1943 that would continue until June 1945, with more than 8,000 M8 light armored cars produced. It would see combat in World War II in the Mediterranean, European, and Pacific Theater of Operations. After World War II, the M8 continued its service in the US Army in the Korean War. Though it was retired soon after the Korean War, the M8 continued seeing use by foreign operators as a military aid item.
