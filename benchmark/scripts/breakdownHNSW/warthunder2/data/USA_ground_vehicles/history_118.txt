History of LOSAT: 
The LOSAT (Line-of-Sight Anti-Tank) system was an evolution of a prior multi-platformed guided missile system design. The concept was initially born out of a US Army requirement for a missile with the capabilities to destroy all types of tanks and armoured vehicles found to be outside of conventional gun range. While other missiles currently in service such as the Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) system were capable of meeting the range requirements, the Army was concerned that these missiles were ineffective due to slow speeds and long flight times to their target at long range. The missile itself was designed by the "Vought" Aerospace company, while Texas Instruments partnered with the firm by providing their upgraded FLIR system. The initial plan for the system was to mount it to the M2 Bradley, and later the M8 Armored Gun chassis. However, due to cost concerns, it would eventually be mounted onto HUMVEEs with additional missiles carried by trailer.
