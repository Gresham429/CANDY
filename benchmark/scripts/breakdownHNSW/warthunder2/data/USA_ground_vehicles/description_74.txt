Description of M47: 
With the M46 as the most modern tank in the US Army, the US knew it could have something better. Work was done alongside the T41 light tank project as the T42 medium tank to try and introduce newer technologies into a new tank design. However, the Korean War broke out in 1950 and the US Army found themselves in urgent need to tanks now. Looking at their work done in the T42, it was decided the expedient route to get more new tanks produced was to mate the T42 turret onto the M46 hull. The design proved optimal and further modifications led to the design being christened the M47 Patton II, sharing the same nickname as the preceding M46. Though urgently produced, its service with the US Army is short-lived as the newer M48 Patton III tank came into service. The M47 would serve a greater role arming US allies in Europe and abroad.
