History of M26_T99: 
In 1944, the main tank development in US Ordnance was the T26E1 tank, which would later become the M26 Pershing. The M26 was made into many different variants in the hope it could fulfil multiple roles. One variant hoped to increase the M26's firepower with the addition of rocket launchers, in a manner similar to the T34 Calliope on the Shermans. The rocket launchers were attached on M26 serial number 2011, the 250th of its kind made from Detroit Tank Arsenal. The rocket launcher attached was the 4.5-inch multiple rocket launcher T99, consisting of two racks on both sides of the turret, carrying a total of 44 rockets for use. The rocket launchers were traversable by the same turret controls for the main 90 mm gun. The T99 launchers were mounted on trunnions and could be jettisoned from inside the tank when empty. Settings for rocket firing came at one at a time, two at a time, and a full salvo dump. The last of these settings can fire all 44 rockets within 7 seconds.[1] The design was informally called M26 T99.
