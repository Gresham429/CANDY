Usage of M4A1: 
The M4A1 Sherman is a very capable medium tank. The 75 mm M3 cannon is capable of destroying nearly all armoured targets at the battle rating. Combined with the very fast turret traverse rate, fast reload time of 6.5 seconds and a vertical gun stabilizer, this tank is suited to an aggressive playstyle due to the M4A1's ability to react quickly and fire relatively accurately without coming to a full stop. The gun depression of -12Â° also makes this tank excel in hull-down positions, unlike any other tank. One must take into account this tanks very thin side armour of 38.1 mm thick, anti-tank weaponry of any rank will be capable of penetrating this weak side armour so protect the flanks.
