Usage of M6A1: 
Although this is a heavy tank, and able to bounce some shells, its armour will not protect it from all incoming fire.  Enemies to specifically watch out for are the IS-1, Panthers, Tigers, and M4A3E2 Shermans, as they can all easily penetrate this vehicle's weak frontal armour.  Make sure to protect the rear flank too: M6A1's engine is very large and prone to catching on fire when hit.
