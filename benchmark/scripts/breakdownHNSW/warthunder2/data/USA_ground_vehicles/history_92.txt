History of T95E1: 
In the early 1950s, the US began looking for a replacement for the M48 series.  In September 1954, the T95 was selected for development; construction of pilot models began in 1957.  The T95E1 differed from the T95 in the inclusion of a recoil system mount and the omission of a two-plane stabilizer, and was completed in early 1958.
