History of T14: 
In early 1942, a conference between United States Tank Committee and Joint British Tank Mission had the British propose the need of an assault tank.[1] The assault tank, a designation reserved by the British at the time that was distinctive from their cruiser and infantry tanks, was not taken up by the US. However, the US agreed to a prototype production plan in which a vehicle design would be produced by both nations, and a limited production would be established for the better of the two. On 30 March 1942[2], the final details were placed with Aberdeen instructed to start designing a vehicle and a wooden mock-up, and the British also working on their vehicle based off the Cromwell chassis, which would become the A.33 Excelsior. The British set the estimated production scale for the assault tank to be 8,500 units.[1] In May 1942, the details were finalized and a designation was chosen for the vehicle, T14.
