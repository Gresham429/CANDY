History of M46_%22Tiger%22: 
The M46 Patton came about around the time of the Korean War. Before that, the US Army armoured units consisted of two tanks, the venerable M4 Shermans and the newer M26 Pershings. Of the two, the Pershing was originally classified as a heavy tank as it weighed 41.7 tons compared to Sherman's 30-ton weight, but a reorganization had the M26 Pershing classified a medium tank after World War II. It proved unsuitable for the role as its mobility was unsatisfactory for that role, using the same Sherman engine, plus an unreliable transmission, to propel a vehicle ten tons heavier.
