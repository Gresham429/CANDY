Description of M4A3_(105): 
Though the M4 Sherman entered service with a 75 mm cannon, it was believed that the M4 Sherman would be relied upon to lob larger high-explosive shells in a direct-fire use. As such, work quickly began on a 105 mm howitzer mount for the M4 Sherman, with first tests starting on a M4A4E1 platform. Awkward ergonomics within the tank turret and an unbalanced turret design delayed proper tests of the howitzer-armed tank until February 1943. US soldier experiences overseas, namely the Italian Theater, validated the need of a howitzer-armed Sherman as troops coming across heavy fortifications had to rely on M7 Priest for their artillery guns, which were poorly suited for the direct fire role. The howitzer-armed M4 Sherman was approved for use and production started in February 1944 to be ready for the Normandy invasion, with the chosen chassis being the M4 (105) and M4A3 (104). Chrysler Corporation was contracted to produce all howitzer-armed tanks and helped produce a total of 4,680 units, with 2,539 being the M4A3 (105) HVSS. These tanks would see use not only in the European Theater, but in the Pacific Theater and even after World War II in the Korean War.
