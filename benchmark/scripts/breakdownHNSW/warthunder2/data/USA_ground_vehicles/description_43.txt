Description of M42: 
The M42 "Duster" is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun mounted on the M41 light tank chassis used by the U.S. Army during World War II. It is an easily transported, lightly armoured vehicle that was constructed for the U.S. Army between 1952 and December 1960 and remained operational until 1988. General Motors Corporation's tank division was in charge of producing the M42 "Duster". The primary armament is comprised of two fully automatic 40 mm M2A1 Bofors autocannons. In the Vietnam War, it proved to be effective against unarmored ground forces despite its original design for anti-aircraft use.
