History of M551(76): 
The history of the M551 Sheridan light tank started in 1959, when at the request of the US Army, work began on a promising tank to replace the M41 Walker Bulldog and M56 SPG. During the final stages of testing, problems emerged with the 152 mm M81 cannon launcher due to an unreasonable amount of recoil and a gun breech prone to cracking. To address these issues with the M551 which had already been put into production, Allison developed a variant with a 105 mm howitzer by March of 1967, and then with a 76 mm M32 gun which had been used on the M41 Walker Bulldog. However, none of the prototypes received approval from the armyâ€™s leadership.
