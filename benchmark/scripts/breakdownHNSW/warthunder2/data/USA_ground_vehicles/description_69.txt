Description of T28: 
The Super Heavy Tank T28 is a premium rank IV American tank destroyer 
with a battle rating of 6.7 (AB/SB) and 6.3 (RB). It was introduced in Update 1.49 "Weapons of Victory". A premium version of the T95, its difference is the removal of the outer tracks for train transport, but it can still fight at the expense of increased ground pressure. The T28 retains the same front armour and 105 mm T5 gun from the T95.
