Usage of M103: 
Armed with an extremely large 120 mm cannon, the tank boasts superior firepower rivalling many other Rank V vehicles. One thing must be said from the start: this tank is all about the cannon, a Gun tank. This defines the general play style of the tank in both arcade and realistic mode: it is a sniper with the sole role of making the enemy's life as miserable and short-lived as possible. The cannon can compete against the armour of the Maus.
