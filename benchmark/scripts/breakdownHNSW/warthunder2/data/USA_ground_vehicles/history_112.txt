History of XM975: 
The XM975 was selected by US Army as a forward air defence system in 1975. The first missiles were delivered in 1977 and fired in 1978. The XM975 was a modified M109 howitzer chassis equipped with a Roland 2 system with a longer range American-made search radar. Unfortunately problems with technology transfer and rising costs terminated the program after producing 27 launchers and 600 missiles, mounted on M812 flatbed trucks.
