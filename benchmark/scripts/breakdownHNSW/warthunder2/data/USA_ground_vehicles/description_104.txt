Description of M3A3_Bradley: 
Since its adoption, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) series have underwent design upgrades to accommodate new features and experiences, leading to the A1 and A2 variants that were deployed during Operation Desert Storm. As the US Army moved towards the 21st century, there was an emphasis in improving the crew's ability to obtain and transmit information as part of the overall digitization of the military. This led to the A3 variant in the late 1990s that saw introduction of new communication equipment to other vehicles, a Commander's Independent Thermal View (CITV), new fire control system, and GPS navigation. The A3 upgrade began full-rate production in 2001, which included the M3 BFV as the M3A3 BFV.
