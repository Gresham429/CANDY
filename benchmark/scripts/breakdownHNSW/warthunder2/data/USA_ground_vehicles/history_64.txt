History of Super_Hellcat: 
During World War II, the M18 "Hellcat" tank destroyer was very effective in its role in American service. Despite that, an attempt to upgrade the vehicle with a better gun took effect around 1944. Instead of the 76 mm gun that it originally had, it would take the 90 mm gun that was going into service at the time.
