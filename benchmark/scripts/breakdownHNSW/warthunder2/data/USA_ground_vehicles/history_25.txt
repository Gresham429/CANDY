History of M10_GMC: 
Conceived after the Battle of France, the US Army employed a doctrine to fight against the expected massed armoured attack the Germans had employed with their Panzer Divisions.[1] The doctrine called for a Tank Destroyer Branch that would be held in reserve to be deployed against an armoured attack. The first few vehicles produced on this concept was the 37 mm GMC M6 and the 75 mm GMC M3. While adequate, these were only seen as a stop-gap measure until better tank destroyers could be developed.[2][3] With requests being sent for a 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage (GMC), a proposal was made in November 1941 for a turreted tank destroyer that would use the chassis of M4A2 Sherman and armed with the 3-inch gun from the M6 heavy tank. The resulting prototype was standardized in June 1942 as the 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage M10 in June 1942.[2]
