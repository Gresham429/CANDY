Usage of M3_GMC: 
The 75 mm GMC M3 cannot go toe-to-toe with other tanks due to the lack of protection for the crew and insufficient armour layout. The armour can only stop rifle-calibre rounds from machine guns, and could possibly deflect 12.7 mm rounds off the frontal arc, but this vehicle was never designed to fight other tanks head-to-head. Its playstyle may generally confuse new or inexperienced players, as they would bring the vehicle up close to the front.
