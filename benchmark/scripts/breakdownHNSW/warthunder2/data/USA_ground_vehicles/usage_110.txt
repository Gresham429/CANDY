Usage of IPM1: 
The IPM1 should primarily rely on its speed and reload time to quickly despatch enemies and move back into cover. Where possible, make flanking manoeuvres or use the Abrams' mobility to get into forward positions with the intention to catch unsuspecting targets off. Be aware, however, that the Abrams is only marginally faster than vehicles like the Leopard 2K and T-80U.
