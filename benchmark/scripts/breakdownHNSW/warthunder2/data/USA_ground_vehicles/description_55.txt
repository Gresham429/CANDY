Description of M26: 
Though the M4 Sherman is ubiquitous among the Allied forces of World War II, the Americans began to seek out a potential replacement. The start of the search began in the T20 medium tank. As the war raged, the technological arms race introduced newer requirements from the tank, such as the request for more firepower and armour over the M4. The culmination of the design work led to the T26E3 heavy tank, which featured thicker sloped armour, a 90 mm gun, and torsion bar suspension. The T26E3 would be adopted as the M26 Pershing, but arrived in early 1945, too late to significantly impact the course of World War II. After being reclassified as a medium tank in the post-war period, the M26 continued to see service in the Korean War before being retired.
