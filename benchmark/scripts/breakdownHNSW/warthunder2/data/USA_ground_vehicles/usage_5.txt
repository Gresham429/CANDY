Usage of LVT(A)(1): 
A tactic is to try facing down a street while hiding the massive unarmored hull. Try to only have the small turret stick out from behind the cover or angle the tank's hull such that only the turret and a small part of the hull/crew is exposed. Next, patiently wait for a target to turn onto the street then use the quick firing and accurate 37mm to destroy them. As the 37mm gun has little explosive filler, it will most often take a minimum of 2 shots to destroy a tank, so try to immobilise the enemy first and then take out the crew. When the gunner gets taken out by return fire, the best case scenario is to retreat back to cover if available, or else sit it out and call for artillery in the meantime. Always prioritise 15cm sIG 33 B Sfl, Chi-Ha and Pz.IV C when there are multiple enemies as these tanks are the bane of the LVT(A)(1). If under artillery fire, immediately get out of the area as the splash damage from the artillery will destroy the tank. When there are no enemies, always clear the frontage with the main gun and the machine guns so as to spot the enemy first and have the first shot advantage.
