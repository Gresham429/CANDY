History of M16_MGMC: 
The role of a mobile anti-aircraft vehicle in the US Army was seen as necessary in order to protect ground troops from enemy aircraft at any place of their deployment. The first such development was the M13 MGMC, which was an anti-aircraft system of two .50 cal machine gun on the back of an M3 Half-Track car. The M13 served with some success, but by 1943 an upgraded version was in production.
