Usage of LVT(A)(4)_(ZIS-2)_(USA): 
LVT(A)(4) ZIS-2 is a fragile tank with a strong bite. The main gun is a very powerful Soviet 57 mm ZIS-2 that has no problem penetrating through the hardest of enemies at its BR. Being such a large tank it has amazing manoeuvrability that works on most terrain. Its high profile makes it an easy target for the enemy to spot from afar and behind objects, fences and hills. Since the LVT(A)(4) has such thin hull armour, it is vulnerable to machine gun and autocannon fire. This makes Self Propelled Anti-Air vehicles and vehicles with 20 mm automatic cannons a lethal enemy, but that is not all the worries, large-calibre guns with HEAT and HE can penetrate with ease and cause detonation on the soft armour of the LVT(A)(4).
