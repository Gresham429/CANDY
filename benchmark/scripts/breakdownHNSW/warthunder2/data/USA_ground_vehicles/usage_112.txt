Usage of XM975: 
When using the XM975, attempt to stay focused on the air threats. As a SAM platform, there are very few ground vehicles that can be knocked out by the Roland missile, so it is better to find a concealed position and avoid contact with enemy armour. The XM975 does have an advantage over quite a few other anti-air vehicles, thanks to the IRST (infrared search and track) mode. Commanders of the XM975 should be aware of this mode, as it prevents detection of lock-on by the enemy aircraft's RWR. The IRST mode also ignores enemy chaff, and is generally just a better mode to operate in as a whole.
