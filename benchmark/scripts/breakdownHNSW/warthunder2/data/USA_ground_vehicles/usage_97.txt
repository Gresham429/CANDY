Usage of M60A2: 
The M60A2 has suffered since the replacement of "Hull Break" with the "Overpressure" mechanic. The main drawback is its main armament, most notably the stock HEAT round. The HEAT round can penetrate the vast majority of targets, however the extremely poor post-penetration damage will not consistently destroy the target in one shot. The high-explosive fairs better due to being able to overpressure most targets (most notably Leopards, or anything resembling that design philosophy) with a single shot to the turret side, turret roof or hull. Before the Shillelagh missile is unlocked, it is recommended to use the high-explosive round as the primary ammunition, while keeping a few HEAT rounds on-hand for the more difficult-to-crack nuts such as the late-era Soviet/Russian heavies and the odd Maus heavy tank. One downside to consider is the long reload, which will make follow-up shots difficult if the enemy is still operational after the first shot.
