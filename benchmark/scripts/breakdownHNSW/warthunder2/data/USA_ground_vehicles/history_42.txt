History of M19A1: 
The development of this vehicle began from the T65 project. The T65 was classified as the 40 mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 and was based off the chassis of the M5 Stuart as requested by US Army Armored Force for a light anti-aircraft vehicle. The T65 was a successful vehicle and went on for about 1,000 units produced, however, it stopped because the production line for the Stuart chassis was phased out as well. As a replacement, the Armored Force peered into the new light tank entering production, the M24 Chaffee, as the basis of their new light anti-aircraft vehicle. This project was called the T65E1 and was being developed at the same time with the M24 (still in development as the T24). The layout for the T65E1 on the new chassis was similar to the one used with Stuart's chassis, with the gun turret at the rear and engine at the middle, and only a few changes were made like changing the original vertical gun shield into an angular one.
