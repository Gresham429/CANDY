Description of T1E1: 
When World War II started, the US began looking into heavy tanks as a means against adversaries. The project began in 1940, settling on a 50 ton tank design. One distinguishing feature on this tank was the incorporation of two cannon armament in the turret, one 3-inch gun and one 37 mm cannon. The program became known as the T1 heavy tank. Originally supposed to be fitted with a hydramatic transmission, it was recommended that a newer gas-electric drive be installed for better performance without much weight gain. This recommendation was accepted and the tank to be equipped with the electric drive was designated as the T1E1. The first T1E1 prototype was delivered around May 1942, which saw favorable enough performance to be considered for standardization as the M6A2. However, the change in priorities in the US from heavy tanks to medium to ease logistics led to an order of 40 M6 heavy tanks, with 20 T1E1 models produced.
