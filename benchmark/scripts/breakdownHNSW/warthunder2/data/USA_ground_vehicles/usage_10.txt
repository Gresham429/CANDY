Usage of M8_Scott: 
In general, the M8 Scott plays like a beefed-up M5A1. The massive increase in gun calibre and destructive potential gives it more flexibility when engaging heavier armoured targets. Like the M3/M5 Stuart, playing this tank aggressively will almost always guarantee a place on the leaderboard. Push for the cap and then take it without hesitation. Should an enemy get there first, enter the cap and flank the target. Get behind their turret and go for a shot to the turret rear. Once the capture point is held, find a good hull down position and use the 75 mm HEAT to destroy any and all oncoming tanks.
