History of AGS: 
The Teledyne AGS was developed by Teledyne Continental motors in the 1980s and competed with the CCVL and the Stingray light tank to get the contract for the  US Army's Armored Gun System program which was looking to replace the M551. The program was seeking to provide air-mobile infantry with a tank that was transportable by a C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft, and lasted from 1980-1992. Development of the tank began in 1982, and the first prototype chassis was built in December 1983, followed by the turret in 1984. The turret and chassis were first assembled together in April 1985 and were shown at the US Army Armor Conference at Ft. Knox. In 1992, the AGS program concluded with the CCVL, which was re-designated XM8, winning the contract. The Teledyne AGS continued to be marketed by Teledyne until 1996, however it had no buyers.
