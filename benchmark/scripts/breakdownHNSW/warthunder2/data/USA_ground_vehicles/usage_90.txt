Usage of M60A1_RISE_(P): 
The M60A1 RISE has very special playstyle, which is affected by the lack of speed. While most tanks at this BR are fast, the M60A1 RISE isn't. That is why you should stay between the first and the second front lines, and clean up enemy tanks that try to rush behind your lines. The M60A1 RISE is best played when holding choke points with your great long range gun, and punishing fast tanks like the Leopard A1A1 that try to rush through. With great penetration for all of your shells, no tank should be a serious problem when you shoot at it, and even if you miss a shot, the M60A1 RISE can cover it with good gun reload. Remember, you are not a rusher, advance with your team, cover them when enemy tanks try to get their flanks, and hold angles at important locations.
