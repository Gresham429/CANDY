History of M1128: 
The XM1128 MGS was designed by General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) - Canada to meet the US Army's Mobile Gun System (MGS) requirement, a requirement for an airmobile infantry support platform that could double in the anti-tank role. The first XM1128 prototype was completed in 1999, and after being chosen as the winner of the competition, eight pre-production units began delivery in 2002 after being redesignated as the M1128 Stryker MGS. The M1128 Stryker entered service with the US Army in 2007.
