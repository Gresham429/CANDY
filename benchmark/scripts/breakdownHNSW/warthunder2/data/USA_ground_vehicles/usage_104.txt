Usage of M3A3_Bradley: 
The proper role of the M3A3 in battles is as a support vehicle. Because the secondary missile launcher deploys only when the vehicle is at a slow speed, the gameplay should be slower and farther away from the frontlines of the battlefield. The TOW-2B modification should be used to its best use, allowing for the player to easily compromise enemy sniper positions using their top down effect. The vehicle's scouting ability should also be used on hard to hit or far-away targets. A secondary use for the vehicle is in more close-quarters maps as a flanker, because the 25 mm cannon can easily penetrate the sides and rear of enemy tanks. Regarding survivability, even though the M3A3 has add-on armour compared to its predecessor, the M3 Bradley still doesn't have enough armour to defend against nearly all threats. The vehicle should be treated as if it can be killed from anywhere, from any round, in any place.
