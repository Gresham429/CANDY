Description of LAV-AD: 
In September 1982, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) adopted the General Motors' submission in the LAV (Light Armoured Vehicle) program as the LAV-25 in order to improve the strategic mobility of the USMC divisions. With enhanced mobility, there was a concern of these units out-speeding the anti-aircraft defense units, especially against short-range, low-altitude aircraft. As such in 1991, the USMC sought for a low-altitude air defence system capable of supporting a rapidly moving LAV (also known as Light Armoured Infantry (LAI)) battalion. The LAV-25 was chosen as the basis to keep pace with the unit, and configuration tests began in 1992 with a rapid-firing rotary cannon and Stinger missiles. By 1996, the Light Armoured Vehicle - Air Defence (LAV-AD) was put into production and the USMC received 17 units by 1997.
