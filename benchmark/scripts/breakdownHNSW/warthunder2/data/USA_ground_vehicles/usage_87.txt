Usage of M551: 
The Sheridan is best described as being a very one-of-a-kind tank. Most light tanks at or above these BRs either carry a normal high-velocity anti-tank weapon or an autocannon meant for versatile use; the Sheridan falls under neither, with its 152mm gun/launcher being by far the most standout feature of the tank. However, this uniqueness means it has problems other tanks normally wouldn't struggle with at its Battle Rating, such as poor shell velocity, a long reload and the inability to handle certain map positions due to its chemical-only weapons kit. Despite its many shortcomings, if mastered, the Sheridan can offer either a high damage brawler playstyle or a long-range supporting playstyle and become a valuable part of the US 8.3 lineup.
