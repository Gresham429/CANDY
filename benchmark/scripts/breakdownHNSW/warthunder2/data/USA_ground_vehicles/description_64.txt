Description of Super_Hellcat: 
Following the introduction of the M36 GMC into the American tank destroyer units, there was a desire to implement as many 90 mm guns as possible to improve the overall American anti-tank firepower. One proposed method was to install the 90 mm gun into the M18 GMC to utilize the M18's great mobility. The design came about by simply placing the M36 turret onto the M18 hull. This configuration, nicknamed "Super Hellcat", proved suitable but World War II ended prior to the design entering production and issuance.
