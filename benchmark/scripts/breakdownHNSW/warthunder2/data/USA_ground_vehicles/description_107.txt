Description of M1A1_HC: 
In the mid-1980s, the US Marine Corps (USMC) considered the M1 Abrams as a replacement to their M60A1 tank fleet. Requesting some modifications to better suit the USMC purposes, the M1A1 Abrams incorporating the changes began production in November 1990. As this new design was used and sent to both US Army and USMC, the tanks became known as the M1A1 HC within the US Army, with "HC" standing for "Heavy Common". The USMC simply referred to the tank as the "Common".
