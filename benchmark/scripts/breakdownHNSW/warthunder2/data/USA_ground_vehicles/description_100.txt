Description of M901: 
In response to the rising relevance of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) in large-scale warfare, the US sought a need to provide the army a mobile ground platform capable of being an ATGM launcher for support. The basis of the design would be the M113 APC as it was available in plentiful numbers across the army and compatible with the existing logistical network. The system was designated as the Improved TOW Vehicle, or ITV, and a design produced by the company Emerson was accepted as the M901 in 1979. The US used the M901 in Operation Desert Storm, where it is credited with 14 kills. More than 3,000 units of the M901 was produced and exported to many foreign users, with the US retiring the M901 starting in the mid-1990s.
