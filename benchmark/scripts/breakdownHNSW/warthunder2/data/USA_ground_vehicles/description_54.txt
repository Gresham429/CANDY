Description of T25: 
As the US Ordnance Department developed the T23 medium tank and received approval in May 1943 to produce 250 tanks, 50 were requested to be upgunned with the new 90 mm T7 gun, with 90 mm equipped T23 being designated "T25". Concepts were developed by converting two T23 tanks into the T25 standard and these tanks were delivered for testing on 21 January 1944. Tested alongside a version with a torqmatic one, the T25E1, as well as an uparmoured version, the T26(E1), the T25 was determined not suitable due to the complicated electric transmission that also made the tank too heavy. The T25E1 and T26E1 with the torqmatic transmission were selected for further production and evaluation. By the summer of 1944, the T25 and T25E1 were cancelled as combat experience in Europe had shifted interest to the more heavily armoured T26E1, which would be further developed into the T26E3 and then standardized as the M26.
