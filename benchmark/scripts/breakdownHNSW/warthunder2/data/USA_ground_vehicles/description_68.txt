Description of T20: 
The Medium Tank T20 was developed by the U.S. Army during World War II to be the replacement of the Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. In July 1943, the Ordnance Department suggested that the 76 mm M1 tank gun armed T23E3 and T20E3 be standardized as the M27 and M27B1. The request, however, was denied, and neither design was ever mass-produced. The U.S. Army did not believe it was necessary to discontinue existing tank production for a vehicle for which there was no immediate need, and the adoption of the 76 mm M1 tank gun was strongly opposed by the U.S. Army. Eventually, various evolutions of the T20 core design resulted in the M26 Pershing.
