History of Imp.Chaparral: 
The Chaparral was an anti-aircraft system developed by the United States during the 1960s to offer short-range air defence capabilities to soldiers and armoured units. The Chaparral employs variants of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile instead of traditional radar-guided missiles and it was meant to be used together with the M163 VADS.
