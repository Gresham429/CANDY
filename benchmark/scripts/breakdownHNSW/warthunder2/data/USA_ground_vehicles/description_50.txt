Description of Cobra_King: 
The Cobra King is a unique version of the M4A3E2 Sherman, which was an up-armoured modification of the M4A3, the fourth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, the Germans assaulted and cornered U.S. soldiers in the town of Bastogne. The Cobra King was the first tank to enter the perimeter of Bastogne, bringing relief to the besieged American 101st Airborne Division. Cobra King saw combat for the first time in 1944. It was destroyed during a battle in France in November 1944, but it was later restored and reassigned. In late 1944, the tank was deployed to Company C of the American 4th Armored Division's 37th Tank Battalion, which was the spearhead of General Patton's Third Army moving into Bastogne. The 37th Tank Battalion was then commanded by Creighton Abrams, subsequently commander of U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and namesake of the M1 Abrams tank. Lieutenant Charles Boggess led a crew that included Hubert S. Smith (driver), Harold Hafner (co-driver), Milton Jafet (gunner), and James G. Murphy (loader). Boggess had taken over for the tank's former commander, Charles Trover, who was killed by a sniper on December 23rd while standing in the turret.
