Usage of T26E1-1: 
The T26E1-1 is a mid-range assault tank, perfect for pushing the enemy on offense, but far less capable when it comes to defensive action. It features strong frontal armour, bouncing nearly all of the shells found in its BR range, unless hit in one of several weak spots, or at an unlucky angle (e.g. lower frontal plate when going over the hill). The key to staying alive is staying on the move, even if only moving two metres front and back, making sure these small, but numerous weak spots remain difficult to hit. The vehicle's strong reverse gear helps with staying mobile. Unlike T34, simply staying hull-down in the T26E1-1 is not viable due to weak spots on the top of the turret and bottom of the turret cheeks. It's best to hide the entire hull of the vehicle between shots, letting allies lure the attention of enemy vehicles.
