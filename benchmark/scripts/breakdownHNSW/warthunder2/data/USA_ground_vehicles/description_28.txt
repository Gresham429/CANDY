Description of M4A5: 
The Ram II* Tank was a Canadian cruiser tank developed during the Second World War. It was based on the chassis of the American M3 Medium tank, but with a new turret that could mount the British 6-pounder gun. The Ram II was designed to replace the Valentine infantry tank, which was considered inadequate for Canadian needs. The first prototype was completed in November 1941, and serial production began shortly after. However, the Ram II was never used in combat as a gun tank, because it was inferior to the American M4 Sherman in terms of armament and protection. The Ram II was only used for training purposes in Britain until mid-1944, and some of its chassis were converted into other roles, such as flamethrower tanks, observation posts and armoured personnel carriers.
