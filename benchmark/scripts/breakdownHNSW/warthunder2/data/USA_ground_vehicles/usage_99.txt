Usage of XM1_(Chrysler): 
This vehicle is best used as a support tank to flank and knock out other tanks from their flanks and not as a "brawler". Instead of charging full speed into the enemy head on. This tank is best suited to attacking from the flank. Flanking is where this tank succeeds, using its speed and manoeuvrability to get to the rear or sides of the enemy. Another good tactic is to shoot-and-scoot to maximize the manoeuvrability and gun over an opponent.
