Description of M103: 
During the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, the American and British representatives witnessed the debut of the Soviet IS-3 heavy tank. Concerned about how protected the IS-3 may be to Allied tanks of the time, the Americans begin considering a tank design with the firepower capable of tackling the tank. By 1948, the new tank project began as the T43, utilizing the American experience developing heavy tanks during World War II. Development of the tank expedited when the Korean War started, showcasing the urgent need of well-armed tanks to counter Soviet ones. As such, the T43 tanks began production even before testing was fully completed, resulting in a lengthy period of rebuilds as faults were discovered and incorporated into the design. Ultimately, 300 T43 and T43E1s were produced and standardized as the M103, with 80 going to the US Army and 220 going to the US Marine Corps. The heavy tanks remained in service until 1974.
