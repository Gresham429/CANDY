History of M26: 
The development of this tank can be traced to the number of tank prototypes produced in the Spring of 1942 as a replacement for the M4 Shermans then in use.[1] One of these prototypes was the T20 medium tank, which was more heavily armoured than the Sherman. This eventually developed to the T22 and T23 designs with different transmissions, all of which were in the rear of the vehicle instead of the front like the Shermans. These designs were comparable to a T-34-85, but these were not quickly adopted over the M4 as the M4 performed fabulously in combat in Africa and Italy.
