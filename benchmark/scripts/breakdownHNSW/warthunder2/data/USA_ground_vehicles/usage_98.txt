Usage of XM1_(GM): 
This vehicle is best used as a support tank and not as a "brawler". Flanking is where this tank succeeds, using its speed and manoeuvrability to get to the rear or sides of the enemy. Another good tactic is to shoot-and-scoot to maximize the manoeuvrability and gun over an opponent. This tank can also be used to devastating effect in urban combat. In urban combat, it is advised that you never go alone, stay with or behind friendly tanks, and do not rush forward. If you play an ambush and defensive style of combat, at least at the beginning of the match, it is likely you will be able to get multiple kills/assists and should be able to stop the enemy push. If your team is winning, and the enemy is outnumbered, it may be possible to push forward quickly but cautiously, in order to flank and catch enemies off guard, hopefully securing victory for your team.
