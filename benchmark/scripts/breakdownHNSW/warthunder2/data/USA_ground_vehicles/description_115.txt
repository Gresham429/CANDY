Description of M1_KVT: 
The M1 Krasnovian Variant Tank is a premium gift rank VII American medium tank 
with a battle rating of 10.3 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update "La Royale". Different to the real one, the M1 KVT in War Thunder was modified from M1 Abrams instead of M1A1. There are several differences on their appearance. Compared to the prototype, the side skirts were removed, and a frontal rubber-fabric screen was added. The gun barrel was covered by a camo net. A fake IR searchlight was mounted on the gun mantlet, and many fake ERA blocks were installed on the turret and the upper glacis. Two external fuel barrels were welded to the rear to mimic Soviet MBTs. The M240 pintle-mounted light machine gun on the reloader's cupola was removed, and each side of the turret had a board with the inscription "ЛОДКА" (‘boat’ in Russian) fixed on the basket.
