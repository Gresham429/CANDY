Description of M24: 
When World War II started, the US Army had the Stuart as their primary light tank. However, the old armour arrangement and anemic 37 mm gun has the US Army desire a more powerful light tank to replace the Stuart. Starting as Light Tank T24, Ordnance Department sought to incorporate the Stuart mobility components into a design with better armour and the firepower of the 75 mm gun. This culminated in 1943 as the M24 and was nicknamed the "Chaffee". About 4,731 units were produced between 1944 and 1945 and the M24 saw its first combat service in the Battle of the Bulge. The M24 Chaffee would go on to serve throughout the rest of World War II, the Korean War, and in foreign armies elsewhere.
