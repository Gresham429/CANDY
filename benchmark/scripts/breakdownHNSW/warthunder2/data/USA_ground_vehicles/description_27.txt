Description of Grant_I_(USA): 
Following the defeat in France, the British military was left in a state of equipment shortage and were in need of American equipment to recover from their losses. The American's premier medium tank of the time was the M3 medium, however the British sought for modifications to refit the tanks to better suit British needs as well as build from their existing armour experiences. This led to a much larger turret bing developed by Rock Island Arsenal for the British military, with the new turret capable of housing a radio and doing away with the machine gun cupola. In order to distinguish this modified M3 from the regular M3 mediums being purchased from the United States, the modified M3 was given the nickname "Grant" after Ulysses Grant, the 18th President of the United States and a general who commanded the Union Army during the Civil War. The Grants served within the British and Commonwealth military forces, serving both in the European and Pacific Theater.
