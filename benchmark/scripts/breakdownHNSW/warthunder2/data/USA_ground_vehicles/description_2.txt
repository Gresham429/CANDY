Description of M3_Stuart: 
The M3 is the first variant of theÂ M3 light tank family. While observing events in Europe and Asia during World War II, American tank designers noticed the M2 was becoming increasingly obsolete and set about improving the design. The M3 was developed following the German invasion of France during World War II. The fast collapse of France prompted the U.S. Army to consider a new doctrine, which resulted in an independent U.S. armoured force. The M3 was an improved design with thicker armour, redesigned suspension, and a new gun recoil system. The vehicle's production began in March 1941 and lasted until October 1943. Furthermore, the M3 chassis served as the basis for a variety of weaponry throughout the war (for example, the 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 (HMC), also known as the M8 "Scott").
