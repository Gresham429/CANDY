Description of T92: 
Despite the M41 Walker Bulldog's acceptance in 1951, it did not meet all of the US Army's requirements. As such, research and development of the M41's successor started nearly immediately. Among the designs trialed was one by Aircraft Armaments, Incorporated (AAI), whose design gets approval to continue in March 1954 as the 76 mm Gun Tank T92. By January 1956, the T92 had beaten its competitors and proceeded as the potential light tank replacement of the M41. However, the T92's future as the new light tank was halted in 1957 when the US Congress asked if the T92 could be made to be amphibious, in response to the discovery that the Soviets were issuing their own amphibious light tank. When it is revealed that the T92 could not be made amphibious, the design was ordered to be cancelled to focus on development of an amphibious light tank.
