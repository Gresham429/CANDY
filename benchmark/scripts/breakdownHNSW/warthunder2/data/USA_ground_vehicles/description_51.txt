Description of M41A1: 
Following the experience of using light tanks in World War II, the US wanted a more airmobile light tank armed with a high-velocity 76 mm cannon to allow the vehicle to better fend for itself. The design became designated as the M41 with the nickname "Walker Bulldog", named after General Walton Walker who died during the Korean War. Further improvements led to the M41A1 variant with hydraulic turret traverse system and more ammo stowage. Despite being considered an improvement over the preceding M24 Chaffee, the M41 was still too heavy for airmobile operations, especially for an air-drop. The M41 would still see use in the US and its allies, but would become replaced by the M551.
