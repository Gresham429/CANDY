Description of M18_GMC: 
In response to the threat of German armoured units that contributed to the Fall of France, the United States developed the Tank Destroyer Branch whose purpose was to help squash armoured breakthroughs from expanding past the front lines. As part of their role, the branch required combat vehicles that were well-armed and were mobile enough to respond to any strategic events. Making do with interim vehicles like the M3 GMC and M10 GMC, the ideal project to develop a vehicle for this role was the T70 by Buick, a fast tank destroyer armed with a 76 mm gun. The vehicle was approved and put in production in Summer 1943 as the M18 GMC and was also associated by its manufacturer's nickname "Hellcat". Though not as numerous as its interim counterparts, the M18 became one of the primary arms of the tank destroyer branch, with its firepower and mobility coming to play in several key battles in the European Theater such as the Battle of the Bulge.
