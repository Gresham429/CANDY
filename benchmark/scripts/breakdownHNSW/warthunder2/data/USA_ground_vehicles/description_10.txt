Description of M8_Scott: 
The 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 (M8 HMC) is a self-propelled howitzer vehicle used by the U.S. Army during World War II. It was built on the chassis of the Light Tank M5 and was armed with an M116 howitzer mounted on an M7 mount. Similarly to how the LVT(A)(4) evolved from the LVT(A)(1) as the 37 mm M6 tank gun proved insufficient for the fire support role, trials with a close-support version of installing the same 75 mm M2 howitzer began first with the Light Tank M3 chassis. However, such a design is inherently problematic as the tank is nose-heavy and can tilt forward during driving. They also deemed the fighting compartment to be extremely cramped. This design was immediately revised by transferring the same 75 mm M2 howitzer to the new Light Tank M5 chassis, which included a new engine and a new fighting compartment design with a well-sloped front that gave greater room and significantly improved protection. Following that, additional modifications were made, including replacing the fixed combat compartment with a new manually rotated turret mounting the same tank gun to allow greater space for the crew. The prototype was eventually designated the 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8.
