Usage of M1128_Wolfpack: 
M1128 Wolfpack is a very competent light vehicle. It works brilliantly as a sniper with high resolution thermal sights, decent APFSDS shell, and laser rangefinder. It also has good mobility and adaptability to manoeuvre across some of the worst terrains that are a nightmare to other wheeled vehicles. These allow you to ambush and flank the enemy from unexpected positions. However, the unimpressive depression and turret rotation speed limit its performance in hilly maps. M1128 Wolfpack is also less effective in static combat and position warfare due to the low amount of main gun ammo. Its hull has poor protection while the turret can absorb many shots from kinetic shells without critical losses. Hence, it's advised to find a mild hull-down hill or proper cover that can hide your hull and allow you to fight back.
