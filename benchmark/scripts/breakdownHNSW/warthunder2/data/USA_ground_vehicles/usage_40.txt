Usage of T1E1: 
The T1E1 is able to penetrate the front of most tanks at its BR with the 76 mm gun and can destroy most smaller enemies in a single shot. With the 37 mm cannon, you can still detrack enemy vehicles or damage cannon barrels. You may also bait your enemy out of cover by firing the 37 mm gun and using the 76 mm when they get out of cover. In addition to the 76 mm and 37 mm guns, you get 3 x .50 cal MGs which are very affective against light vehicles and SPAAs. The playstyle is similar to the M6A1, with the main difference being the reverse speed for the T1E1. The reverse gearbox allows for a scoot-and-shoot play-style with the player being able to move backwards and forwards at a impressive speed.
