Description of M1_Abrams: 
Following the cancellation of the MBT-70 and XM-803, the US Army continued their search for the next main battle tank to replace their M60s. With a goal of producing a top-rate main battle tank under a fixed price limit, both General Motors and Chrysler competed for the optimal design the US Army will choose. In November 1976, the Chrysler model was chosen for the XM-1 contract, and was accepted for service in 1981 as the M1 Abrams tank. The basis of the new main battle tank for the US Army, 2,374 units of the M1 Abrams would be produced. Accepted under constrained budgets, the now standardized M1 Abrams would go on to feature multiple improvement programs, such as the introduction of a 120 mm gun, as well as constant refurbishments to keep the tank up to date.
