History of M1A1_HC: 
Though the M1 Abrams became accepted into service of the United States Army in November 1981,[1] the United States Marines Corps (USMC) were not able to immediately look into procurement of the Abrams tanks due to budget constraints. It was not until February 1985 that Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Paul Kelly sought to officially replace the M60A1 in USMC service with the M1A1 Abrams, with plans for 490 M1A1 to replace 760 M60A1 beginning in November 1990.[2]
