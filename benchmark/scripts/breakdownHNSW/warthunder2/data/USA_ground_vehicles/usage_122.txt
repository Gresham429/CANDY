Usage of Merkava_Mk.3D_(USA): 
The best trait of the Merkava Mk.3D is its spectacular firepower. It has a far more powerful gun than the contemporary IPM1 or M1 Abrams but lags behind these tanks in terms of armour protection and mobility. As such, the Merkava is best used in a second line support or sniping role where it is less likely to attract enemy fire and can instead focus on sending enemies back to the hangar with the M322 APFSDS. Find good positions that allow the Merkava to spot enemies early and retreat into cover if necessary. If the situation gets hot, the Merkava can also rely on its huge arsenal of smoke grenades to create its own cover. It is possible to smoke up entire portions of the map, potentially saving yourself or your teammates from helicopters or snipers.
