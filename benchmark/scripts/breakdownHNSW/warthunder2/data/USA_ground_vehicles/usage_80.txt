Usage of M163: 
The M163 is a support vehicle through and through. Boasting an immense fire rate of 3000 rounds per minute from its M168 Vulcan cannon, the M163 is best used as a point-defense SPAA and a tag team support vehicle, able to quickly destroy the barrels and tracks of any vehicle it can cleanly get shots at without retaliation. Against air targets it is even better due to the introduction of the first tracking radar in the US tech tree with the AN/VPS-2. However, the lack of a search radar may make it more difficult to identify threats to you and your team before they have already attacked.
