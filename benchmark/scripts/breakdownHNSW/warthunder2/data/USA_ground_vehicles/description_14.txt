Description of M3A1_(USMC): 
The M3 Stuart light tank was developed from M2A4, consisting of many improvements to the design such as a trailing idler suspension. Additional improvements were soon implemented, primarily a new turret that came with new gun stabilizers, hydraulic turret traverse mechanism, and a turret basket for the turret crew, and the new design was named the M3A1 Stuart in 1941. The M3A1 gradually replaced the M3 light tanks in service, including the United States Marine Corps (USMC), which received them in 1942. The M3A1 would serve in the USMC in their various Pacific Campaign against the Japanese until the end of World War II. One modification performed by the USMC in 1944 was a flame-thrower tank, which used 24 M3A1 and attached a flame gun in the hull machine gun position. These modified M3A1 were nicknamed “Satan” and were used in the various battles in the Marianas.
