Usage of T92: 
The T92, as a light tank, can perform as an adequate reconnaissance tank in the battlefield, using the low profile the weave through small cover that most larger tanks cannot exploit. The 76 mm cannon also allowed for a great ambush weapon with its great gun depression, with the 76 mm having access to a HEATFS and APDS rounds. Like most light tanks, however, with only around 40 mm of effective frontal armour, the T92 cannot take any abuse larger than a 12.7 mm machine gun round so any possible return fire should be avoided.
