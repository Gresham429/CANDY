Description of M4A1_(76)_W: 
The M4A1 (76) W Sherman is the first variant of the late-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. These were essentially up-gunned and upgraded models of the early generation M4A1 variant, with a modified T23 turret housing the new 76 mm M1 tank gun and split loader's hatches, and "wet" ammunition stowage to reduce the risk of ammo rack detonation. The M4A1 (76) W featured an upgraded oil gear turret traverse mechanism and a simpler stabilizer. The M4A1 (76) W tank was the first of the late-generation M4 Sherman variants to see action in the U.S. Army. These tanks were shipped to depots in England in time to be assigned to units for Operation Neptune, also known as the Normandy landings. It never saw combat, though, because no one wanted them at the time. The primary reason was a lack of time for training on the M4A1 (76) W before the landings, and no one wanted any supply difficulties on the M1 tank gun's ammunition for the logistic lines. However, the M4A1 (76) W and other 76 mm-armed Shermans would see heavy combat in Israeli hands after the Second World War.
