Description of CCVL: 
The Close Combat Vehicle Light (CCVL) is developed as part of the United States Army's Armored Gun System (AGS) competition in the 1990s to design a light tank to replace the M551 Sheridan and the TOW-equipped High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV; colloquially: Humvee) to equip new light divisions. It was the culmination of various development initiatives conducted in the 1970s to provide air-mobile light infantry squads with the firepower required for success on the battlefield. The three companies that were designed for the demand were Cadillac Gage Company, Teledyne Continental, and FMC Corporation. Cadillac Gage Company designed the Stingray light tank in the standard four-man configuration. The FMC Corporation designed the CCVL in a three-man configuration due to the installation of an autoloader. Teledyne Continental designed the Expeditionary Tank in an unusual two-man configuration, featuring an unmanned turret and autoloader. In 1992, the FMC design was chosen, readjusted, and renamed the M8 Armored Gun System. However, the entire AGS project was ultimately cancelled in the mid-1980s due to funds being withdrawn due to the Gramm-Rudman Act, and procurement of the M8 Armored Gun System terminated in 1997.
