Description of M4A3E2_(76)_W: 
The M4A3E2 (76) W Sherman - Assault Tank, also known as the "Jumbo", is a special up-gunned and armoured modification of the M4A3, which is the fourth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4 (Sherman) family. Approximately 100 M4A3E2s were up-gunned to 76 mm M1 tank guns in February 1945, using supplies salvaged from knocked-out late-generation M4 Shermans and standard supply stocks. Since the M4A3E2 gun mount was originally designed for the 76 mm M1 tank gun, this upgrade was a relatively simple field upgrade. The reorganization of the main tank gun ammunition stowage was the most difficult part of the upgrade. This necessitated the removal of the turret as well as the installation of 76 mm ammunition racks in place of the shorter 75 mm ammunition racks. These replacement racks were then held in place by a series of custom-made welded bracing. According to records, such a modification required around 75 hours per tank. It should be emphasized that the term 'Jumbo' does not exist in any military material and is probably certainly a post-war nickname, possibly developed by a model organization.
