Usage of Merkava_Mk.2B_(USA): 
The Merkava shines in two primary roles - as an urban fighter and a long to medium-range sniper, which is not different to its real-world counterparts. When sniping, its excellent stabilization provides a significant advantage when peaking out of the cover for quick shots, and a small turret gives enemy a very little time to spot and aim at the tank. Added laser rangefinder in Realistic modes further decreases exposure time needed to get the shot. In urban environments, the engine and well-dispersed crew allows the tank to survive most direct hits, while 8.1 s reload time (compared to an analogue average 8.7 s) allows it to take the second shot before most of its competitors, and thanks to the advanced stabilization - it will be an accurate shot. What should be avoided though, is getting flanked, as the side-protection is negligible, making mobile warfare on more open maps extremely risky.
