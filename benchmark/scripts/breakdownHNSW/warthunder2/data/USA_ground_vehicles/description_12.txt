Description of M2A4_(1st_Arm.Div.): 
Based on the armoured warfare lessons learned from the Spanish Civil War, the M2A4 light tank began to be designed to introduce thicker armour and a cannon to the tank. 375 of the M2A4 tanks began production in May 1940 and lasted until April 1942, with 375 tanks produced between two companies. Although the M2A4 saw combat within the US Marine Corps, the US Army issued the M2A4 only for training purposes to armoured units, including the 1st Armored Division. The 1st Armored Divison retained the M2A4 until it was replaced by the succeeding M3 Stuart light tank just before the division was sent to participate in Operation Torch in November 1942.
