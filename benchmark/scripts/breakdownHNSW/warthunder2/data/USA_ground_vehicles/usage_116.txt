Usage of M1A1_AIM: 
The AIM plays just like its regular tech tree counterparts, meaning seasoned Abrams players will already be accustomed to its playstyle. The increased turret protection allows it to make use of hull down tactics just as effectively as the M1A1 HC and M1A2, with the 2nd generation thermal sights allowing for easier target identification and acquisition at range. It can also brawl relatively well because of its quick reactionary ability. The KE-W APFSDS round is perfectly capable of tackling its contemporaries.
