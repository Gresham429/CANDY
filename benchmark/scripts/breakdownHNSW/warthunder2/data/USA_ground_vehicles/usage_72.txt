Usage of M6A2E1: 
When driving the M6A2E1, one will easily notice the tank's turret is near indestructible: it can resist many shots as long as they aren't aimed at a trap shot or to the upper turret. The hull, however, isn't as indestructible: it may bounce a shot or two but it's not really reliable, especially with weak hull cheeks that any shot with explosive filler will instantly penetrate.
