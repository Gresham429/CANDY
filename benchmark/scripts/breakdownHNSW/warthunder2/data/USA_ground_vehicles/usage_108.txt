Usage of M1_Abrams: 
Its armour, whilst reliable in downtiers and when facing tanks of the same BR, should not be relied on when uptiered. Many tanks will destroy you. But when downtiered, your armour will protect you 70-75% of the time. Many rounds at this BR and below have a hard time facing you and even penetrating you in the LFP even.
