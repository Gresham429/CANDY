History of M15_CGMC: 
The history of the M15 CGMC, or Combination Gun Motor Carriage, the vehicle is derived from the prototype T28 CGMC. The T28 prototype was itself developed from the US Army Coast Artillery Corps T1A2 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage projects, which was designed around the current Army 37mm M1A2 Autocannon to be flanked with two .50 calibre M2 Browning machine guns on an M2 half-track. This vehicle was designated the T28, but failed evaluations in Aberdeen Proving Grounds due to the heavy recoil, causing the project to be cancelled in 1942. But the US Army Armored Forces required a mobile anti-aircraft system to support their tanks in combat, so the T28 was revitalized with modifications, using the larger M3 half-tracks as the basis instead with a newer site for target spotting, this modified variant was the T28E1 CGMC, and 81 of these were built from July to August of 1942 by White Motor Company. These vehicles did not have an armoured mount for the crew, leaving the gun and crew exposed to enemy fire, but after initial production, the vehicle was given an armoured shield and this was now designated the M15 CGMC.
