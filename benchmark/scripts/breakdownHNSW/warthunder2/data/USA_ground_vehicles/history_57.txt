History of M4A3E2_(76)_W: 
Long before D-Day, American war planners knew that it would a long and decisive battle against the German defensive and that the need for an assault tank to push the lines and capture the beach was needed. The Americans knew they would need a tank that was up-armoured and up-gunned, something beyond the standard M4 Sherman. The hope was the have the M26 Pershing finished by 1944, however, because of difficulties, it was delayed to 1945.
