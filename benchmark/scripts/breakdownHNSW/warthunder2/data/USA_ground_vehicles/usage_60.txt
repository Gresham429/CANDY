Usage of T34: 
The T34 is a very strong tank and few tanks have the guns to take it out effectively from the battlefield. If you're fighting tanks of your own BR or lower, the German long 88 mm guns (whether it be PaK or KwK guns) will be able to contest your armour at close range if used well. This includes the Waffentrager, Tiger II (P) and (H) models, the Nashorn, the Ferdinand, and the Jagdpanthers. There is also the threat of the occasional Ru 251, which packs a 320 mm penetration HEATFS shell. The Soviets also have a few cannons that can be effective against the T34, be on the lookout for tanks which utilize the 100 mm, such as the T-44-100, SU-100P, or SU-100. These 100 mm shells will not struggle too much against your hull or turret, at least at close range. The same can be applied to the ISU variants. (The ASU-85) does get a HEATFS shell which defeats your armour most of the time, more on that below.) The tanks mentioned above can be dealt with against with relative ease at medium range with the 120 mm cannon. Another country which catches most people off guard is France. The AMX-50 and Lorraine 40t with their magazine systems will shred your armour given if they have the time to aim properly. Their shot rounds will break your gun breech quickly, but if you play well the T34's armour will hold up.
