Usage of M50: 
Obviously the M50 is not a main battle tank, with its thin armour even Reserve units are a threat. Stealth and guile is the tactic, using its high mobility and small size to get in ambush or outflank an enemy push fast. Memorize shooting spots, be it concealed ambush points or sheltered ranged locations overlooking active routes. The most important tactic is learn how to operate it. Define a separate keybind for the trigger of the spotting gun and learn the firing sequence. There is nothing worse than sighting a perfect target, but firing the gun into a rock because it is on the wrong side. Also keep in mind the turret has only 80 degrees of traverse (±40°), a consideration during tactical manoeuvres. Still, compared to other anti-tank guns this traverse is much wider, and also has a respectable -10 depression. Add that -10 degrees and angled position to the already extremely sloped front glacis armour and one could be bouncing large calibre AP rounds. Don't forgot to spot enemies too, make them feel the pressure, not you.
