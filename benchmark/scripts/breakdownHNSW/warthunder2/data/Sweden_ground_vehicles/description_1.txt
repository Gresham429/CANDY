Description of Strv_m/31: 
The Stridsvagn m/31, also known as Landsverk L-10, was designed and built by AB Landsverk during the interwar period. For its time it was quite revolutionary, and it was considered a medium tank. It was the first tank to ever be produced with an all-welded design, and it used periscopes for increased visibility, instead of the traditional view ports. It mounted a very common armament for the time, a 37 mm L45 Bofors anti-tank gun and two license-produced Browning M1917 MGs. While the tank did serve with Sweden, only three were ever built, and the last one has been conserved at the Swedish Tank Museum Arsenalen.
