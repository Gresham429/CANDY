Usage of VEAK_40: 
The VEAK 40 is a fairly basic tier 5 SPAA. It has a radar and effective anti air guns that will easily take out any aircraft even at longer ranges with ease. The guns also has fairly high penetration on its armour-piercing ammo and will easily take out lightly armoured vehicles in the front and the majority of vehicles in the side. Its protection is more or less non-existent and the VEAK 40 can even be dealt with using regular low-calibre machine guns. In arcade battles, it is one of the earliest anti-air vehicles with VT shells.
