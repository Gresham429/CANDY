Description of Strf_9040_BILL: 
Since its introduction in early 1998, the Strf 9040 was criticized for its lack of guided munitions against tanks; most IFVs like the Marder, the BMP-2, and the Bradley used ATGMs to engage heavily armoured targets. Thus, a demonstrator was ordered, using the Strf 9040A as a basis. The vehicle was heavily modified to use the Rbs 56 BILL II ATGM launcher, the launch mechanism was actually very similar to the one used by the Bradley, the launcher could fold itself, and be used from inside the vehicle, while the reload required manual loading from the outside. The system was promising, but issues in development cancelled the project.
