History of Ikv_91: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 91, or Ikv 91, was a Cold War era design made in Sweden. Although it is practically a light tank, it was designed as an infantry support vehicle, similar in role to the Russian PT-76. It was designed by Hägglunds, and ordered by the Swedish military. Hägglunds had previously designed the Pbv 302, an armoured personnel carrier. When designing the Ikv 91, Hägglunds used many parts from the Pbv 302, in order to reduce costs and increase parts commonality. The design featured a lightweight, lightly-armoured hull. The armament consisted of a 90 mm gun mounted in a turret. Secondary armament consisted of two low-calibre machine guns. The vehicle was powered by a Volvo Penta model TD 120 A diesel engine producing 330 hp. One of the requirements for the design was amphibious capability, a necessity in certain parts of Sweden. As such, it was amphibious with some preparation. The prototype was completed in 1969, but production wasn't authorized until 1975. 212 Ikv 91 were produced, and were given to infantry brigades, for use as tank destroyers. The Ikv 91 served until the early 2000s, replaced by newer designs such as the Strf 90 and Strv 121/Strv 122. In 1983, a prototype for an improved Ikv 91 model was created. This prototype mounted a 105 mm gun, instead of the 90 mm gun. It was marketed for export, but was never ordered It is often known as the Ikv 105.
