Description of Pvkv_II: 
The Pansarv√§rnskanonvagn II a prototype tank destroyer designed by Landsverk in the late '40s, representing one of the concepts aimed at repurposing the ageing Strv m/41 S-II chassis, as the 37 mm armament was deemed obsolete at that time. Pvkv II was equipped with a Lvkan m/37A, chosen for its superior anti-tank performance and suitability for anti-tank combat compared to the Kan m/38. While undergoing trials alongside the Pvkv III, both concepts were regarded as outdated, leading to the decision not to deploy either into service.
