History of Bkan_1C: 
In the late 1950's, Swedish engineers began work on a new self-propelled artillery unit, taking design choices proven from the previous Kranvagn experimental project and combining them with the modified chassis of the Strv 103A. The result of this undertaking was the Bandkanon 1, whose first prototype underwent testing in the early 1960's.
