Description of VIDAR: 
The Versatile InDirect ARtillery is a self-propelled artillery system employed by Norway since 2022. The system is an export version of the South Korean K9 Thunder Self-Propelled Artillery Gun. Norway acquired the system to replace its aging M109A3GNMs of American origin. Norway acquired a total of 24 K9 Thunder artillery systems. The deliveries started in 2019 and concluded in 2021. The system has some differences compared to the South Korean version, like a combined NBC protection and air conditioning situated at the rear of the turret. This system was given to the Artilleribataljonen of the Brigade Nord, the only artillery unit in the Norwegian army.
