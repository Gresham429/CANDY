Description of Strv_m/39_TD: 
The Stridsvagn m/39 was ordered in 1939 by KAF, that saw how new tank designs were shaping the battlefield, and the m/38 was considered to be too weak in terms of armour. The m/39 would have been a minor upgrade to its predecessor, with upgraded armour and other minor changes. AB Landsverk was against it however, since the m/38s hull was not able to sustain the increased weight. In the end, the turret was slightly modified, it included a new fire control system, as well as a lever steering system which was more favourable. While the m/38 was named L-60-S, the Stridsvagn m/39 was designated L-60-S/II.
