History of Pvkv_III: 
At the beginning of the Cold War, the Swedish military was looking to equip its armed forces with new armoured units. However, as the state budget didn't allow for the procurement of completely new units, the military resorted to converting existing chassis into new vehicles. As a result, a range of experimental vehicles were hastily designed and tested to act as a stopgap measure until more modern equipment could be acquired.
