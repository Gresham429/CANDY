History of T-28_(Sweden): 
The T-28 was the first medium tank the Soviets ever manufactured, it was intended to be used as a heavily armoured tank to support infantry and break through enemy defenses. During the Winter War, the Soviets found out the hard way that the T-28 had inadequate armour and due to this (and poor tactics) the T-28 tanks took heavy losses with an estimate of 200 T-28 tanks lost during the Winter War. Of the T-28's operating in the Winter War the Finnish managed to capture 7, all of which were integrated to the Finnish army and saw combat later in the Continuation War. The Finnish nicknamed the T-28 "postivaunu" (postal wagon) after a captured T-28 was found to be carrying the mail and salaries of Soviet soldiers.
