History of Pvlvv_fm/42: 
Not much is known about this tank since only one was ever built and never put into active service. The project went under the generic name 20 mm pansarvärnsluftvärnsbandlavettage (20 mm anti-tank, anti-air, tracked-mount), which can be abbreviated to 20 mm pvlvblav using the Swedish abbreviation system, which was a project to trial the concept of a self-propelled anti-air gun. The Swedish army had briefly trialled the Landsverk L/62 Anti I in the late '30s but no orders were made. However, with the start of WWII, it became clear that the Swedish tank units needed self-propelled anti-air support. Initially it was unknown what type of weapon was needed. On one side there was the quick firing 20 mm Bofors L/70 gun which was effective at short range engagements, and on the other side was the slower firing 40 mm Bofors L/60 gun which was effective at medium range engagements. In the end it was decided to trial both systems on self-propelled platforms.
