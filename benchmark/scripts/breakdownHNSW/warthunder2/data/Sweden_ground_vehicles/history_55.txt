History of Ikv_91-105: 
AB Hägglunds & Söner, the company behind the ikv 91 light tank, had high hopes for a successful export market, outside the domestic use of the platform. The design had been ill-fated early since the chassis was too weak to handle high-pressure weaponry, necessary for sub-calibre munitions. By the 1980s however, the ability to mount a high pressure 105 mm cannon was taken to consideration, as Bofors had developed a low-recoil variant. This design idea quickly took shape in 1983 as India was looking for a new amphibious light tank. The requirements involved full firing capability when submerged, meaning the cannon had to be stabilized. The vehicle introduced a commanders fire control system, as well as Infra-red night vision devices provided by SAAB. The new gun was the Rheinmetall Rh 105-11 super-low recoil gun in a new turret. This increased the weight up to 2 tons, however the amphibious speed was also increased to 12 km/h thanks to a new engine.
