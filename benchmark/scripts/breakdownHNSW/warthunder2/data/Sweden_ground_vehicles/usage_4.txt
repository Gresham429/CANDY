Usage of Strv_m/40L: 
The Strv m/40L is a light tank with a large bite for its small calibre. Being armed with a 37 mm Bofors gun doesn't seem like a huge threat to most tanks that it faces, as its contemporaries will often equip similar or larger calibres. However, unlike other nations' tanks, the Strv m/40L is able to research potent APDS rounds.
