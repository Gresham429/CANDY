Description of Pbv_301: 
The Pansarbandvagn 301 is an Swedish infantry fighting vehicle based on the aging Strv m/41 hulls that were no longer intended for service, the rebuilding of these hulls were tasked to Hägglund & Söner on design to have a vehicle able to safely carry a squad of 8 fully equipped soldiers that were gonna be used by the Swedish Army. A total of 220 Strv m/41's were converted to Pbv 301, where it would have a short service life but would prove valuable lessons for the upcoming Pbv 302 that were gonna replace them. Pbv 301 were just an temporary solution in an situation where they needed vehicles for the infantry to keep up with the tanks. Upon being able to carry eight soldiers, the Pbv 301 were also equipped an oscillating casing with an 20 mm Akan m/45B taken from old decommissioned J21A-2's to be able provide an direct fire support for the infantry, being able to deal with both hostile infantry and lightly-armoured vehicles. The infantry could also fight from inside the vehicle via two hatches on the roof of the vehicle providing cover for the Pbv 301 if the main armament were occupied with other targets. It service were from 1962 and were gonna be the troop transport for the armoured brigades until it were gonna be phased out in the early 1970s in favour of the newer Pbv 302.
