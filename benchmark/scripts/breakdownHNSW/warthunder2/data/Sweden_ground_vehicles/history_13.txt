History of Pbil_m/40: 
In 1937, the Danish Army requested the development of an armoured car from the Swedish AB Landsverk company. Developed under the name 'Lynx', three of the 18 units ordered were already shipped to Denmark before the outbreak of WWII. However, after the outbreak of hostilities, Sweden placed an export ban on all military equipment and the remaining Lynx armoured cars remained in Sweden.
