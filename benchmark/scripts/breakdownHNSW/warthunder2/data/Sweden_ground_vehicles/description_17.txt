Description of Strv_m/42_EH: 
The Stridsvagn m/42 EH is a continued development of the AB Landsverk tanks designated Lago I, that Hungary had requested back in the 1930s. When Sweden requested a new heavy tank armed with a 75 mm cannon, AB Landsverk saw the opportunity to use the existing Lago I as a basis for the new tank. Only 57 of the 282 Strv m/42 tanks ordered were produced to the EH standard, while the rest were the TH and TM variants. The tank was already outdated when it was introduced, with very thin armour, poor mobility, and a mediocre gun for the time. In the mid-1950s when Sweden bought in the Strv 81, the Strv m/42 EH was repurposed for infantry support and redesignated as Ikv 73 in 1957.
