Usage of Lvtdgb_m/40: 
As any anti-aircraft vehicle, the Lvtdgb m/40 is to be used against aerial targets to cover teammates from aerial attacks. The low fire rate of the 40 mm gun can make this task difficult, but one hit with the cannon's high-explosive shells should be sufficient in knocking down a plane from the skies.
