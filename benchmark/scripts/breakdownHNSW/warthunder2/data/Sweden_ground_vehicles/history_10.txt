History of Strv_m/39: 
The Strv m/39 is a continued design from the Strv m/38. In 1939, KAF had started discussions about ordering 20 new Strv m/38s to improve the strength of the armoured company and, seeing the international way of designing tanks equipped with cannons, they requested that new designs of Strv m/38 should have improved armour by making it thicker to combat this threat. AB Landsverk was against it since the construction of the L-60-S (Strv m/38) would not be able to handle this request of the additional weight the new armour would add to it. And because of this made them a contract that there would be small changes to the L-60-S, mainly modifications to the turret adding room for an additional machine gun to be placed. Additionally, there would a new control system for the tank, Strv m/38 had the old system using a steering wheel, the new tank would use lever steering which was more favourable.
