Description of Pvkv_IV: 
The Pansarvärnskanonvagn IV Värjan was an experimental tank destroyer that was developed during the 1950s along with the Pvkv II and Pvkv III. The Pvkv IV is based on the hull of Strv m/40L with an new turret to be able fit the new 57 mm Pvkan m/43 and keep the L-60 hulls in service longer. However, the Pvkv IV was soon cancelled when the Strv 74 entered service.
