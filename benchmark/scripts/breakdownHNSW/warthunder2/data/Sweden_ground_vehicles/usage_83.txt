Usage of T_80_U_(Sweden): 
The Swedish T 80 U plays just like its counterparts in the Russian tree, albeit without access to the more powerful 3BM46 APFSDS round. It is mobile and can fulfill the role of a good all-round MBT, and can serve as a good backup to the Strv 122s at top tier. It is worth noting that top APFSDS rounds that have close to 600mm of penetration can penetrate its front plate.
