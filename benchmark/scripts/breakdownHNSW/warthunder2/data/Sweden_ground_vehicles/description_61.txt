Description of ItPsV_90: 
The ItPsV 90 (Finnish: IlmatorjuntapanssarivaunuÂ 90; Anti-Aircraft Tank 90) represented the retrofitted fleet of SPAAG in Finnish Army by combining the chassis of Leopard 2A4 and Marconi Marksman turret systems from previous T-55AM chassis. Finland ordered 7 Marksman system from British in 1990 as their supplementary to low-altitude air-defense, these systems were originally installed on seven Polish T-55AM chassis and have been served in the Finnish Army since then; due to the aging of T-55AM chassis and seeking for more reliable chassis, the previous fleet has been stored since 2010 until new stock of Leopard 2A4 has arrived, which 7 of these tanks were converted as the new ItPsV 90 in service at 2015.
