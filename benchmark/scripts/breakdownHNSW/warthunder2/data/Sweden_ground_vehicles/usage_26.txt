Usage of Strv_m/42_DT: 
The Strv m/42 DT's standout feature is an excellent reload rate, which can be as low as 3 seconds. To complement this gun, the Strv m/42 DT is equipped with a stock AP round, and an APCBC shell which has reasonable penetration and explosive filler values compared to similarly-sized rounds at this tier. At its best, the gun will easily blast most medium and light tanks, but will struggle with the heavy tanks, so choose your fights accordingly.
