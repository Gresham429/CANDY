Description of Strv_m/41_S-II: 
In March of 1940, Sweden ordered about 90 TNH tanks (known as the Panzer 38(t) in German service). After negotiations, the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license. The Stridsvagn m/41 was armed with a 37 mm Bofors m/38 gun and the design utilized riveted construction. In June of 1942, Sweden ordered 122 Strv m/41 S-II. The armour was increased from 25 mm to 50 mm thick. Because of the added weight of the armour, a more powerful engine was added, the Type L 603 engine. This meant the hull length needed to be increased by 65 mm. The Strv m/41 served until the late 1950s, when all Strv m/41 were converted to the Pansarbandvagn (Pbv) 301.
