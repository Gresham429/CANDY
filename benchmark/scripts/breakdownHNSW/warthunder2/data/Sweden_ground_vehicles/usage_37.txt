Usage of Pbv_501: 
The Pbv 501 is in essence a BMP-1 stripped of its ATGM armament. To some this may seem like an unacceptable downgrade - the 4 missiles the BMP-1 carries have good explosive mass, speed and let the vehicle engage far away targets effectively, and this is a valid point. However, the Pbv 501 makes up for it by having a full 1 BR lower placement than the regular BMP-1, and still retains the 2A38 73mm cannon. The 2A38 is an acquired taste; To those who don't like the low velocity and sometimes middling damage, the gun is a lackluster weapon, while to those who know the ballistics it can be a surprisingly effective cannon with a good reload rate.
