Usage of VIDAR: 
VIDAR's CN98 (155mm) cannon can only inflict damage with HE rounds, so players should be at least aware of how Overpressure works in War Thunder. Having some knowledge of where vehicles can be overpressured (turret rooftops, the upper plates of the hull, areas around hull ammunition storages and so on) is the bare minimum to be able to do any consistent damage to enemy vehicles.
