Description of Bkan_1C: 
The Bkan 1C was a Swedish SPG developed on the S-tank chassis. For its time, it was quite innovative. Developed by Bofors, it introduced a massive 155 mm autocannon designed to offer a high fire rate, being able to fire 15 shells in less than 45 seconds. The rounds offered a range of up to 28 kilometres, with 47 kg of weight. Early variants of the tank had poor mobility because they used the same engine as the Strv 103, future variants corrected this issue, since the Bkan 1 weighed over 50 tons. Its mobility was important to avoid counterbattery fire and change positions quickly. It remained in service from 1967 to 2003, with a total of 26 units built over the years.
