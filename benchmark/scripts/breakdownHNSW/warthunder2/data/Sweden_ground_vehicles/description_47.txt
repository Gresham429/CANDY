Description of Strv_103A: 
The Strv 103A was the first production variant of the Strv 103 family. It was delivered after the trials of the "zero series" provided satisfactory results. An order of 70 units was placed by the Army with a cost of 500 million kr (SEK). The first batch was delivered in 1964, and was a liked vehicle by their crews. However it also came with some problems, like the engine, that was unreliable, specifically, it was a 300hk gas turbine engine that was underpowered and unneficient, thus it needed to be replaced for a more capable engine in the Strv 103B.
