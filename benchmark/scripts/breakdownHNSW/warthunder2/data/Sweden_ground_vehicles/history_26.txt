History of Strv_m/42_DT: 
In 1944, the Swedish military considered upgunning the Strv m/42. They designed a new turret with a new 75 mm gun with an autoloader. The turret was named "Delat Torn", which means "split turret" in English. This name comes from the fact that the autoloader would split the turret down the middle into two separate compartments. The gun was set as far back as possible inside the turret in order to reduce how much of the barrel hung out of the turret. In 1944, a mockup was made, with a wooden turret. The prototype was made in 1945, and it was tested throughout 1946. It was found that the design was unsuccessful, and it never entered production or service.
