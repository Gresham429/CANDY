History of T-72M1_(Sweden): 
The T-72 is a Soviet-designed main battle tank which started production in 1971. It quickly became the main workhorse for the Soviet army and was spread around in many former Warsaw pact nations, as well being exported to multiple others. Finland bought 162 T-72 tanks which were first adopted into service in 1984. 63 were bought from the Soviets while the remaining 99 were bought from East-Germany's storage after the German unification. Finland operated the T-72 as their main MBT until they were withdrawn from service in 2006 and replaced by Leopard 2A4 tanks. The Finnish army also looked into creating some domestic upgrade packages for the T-72, only known as "Finmod". Little is known about these planned upgrades since the project files remain classified until the late 2020's.
