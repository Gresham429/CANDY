Description of VEAK_40: 
The VEAK 40 was developed by the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors by request of the Swedish army as a 1960s next generation Swedish SPAA following the 1940s limited production Lvkv fm/43 SPAA and failed 1950s Lvkv 42 prototype SPAA. A single prototype based on the Strv 103 chassis was built and delivered for testing in 1964. The project was delayed at this point but testing commenced and the vehicle proved to be ahead of its time regarding armament and fire control system. This however made the vehicle too costly and in the end the project had to be scrapped due to resources going to the Swedish air force rather than the Swedish air defense. The name VEAK 40 follows Bofors naming scheme, not the Swedish army's naming scheme. Its full historical Bofors-name was Bofors VEAK 40 X 60, VEAK indicating type (tracked vehicle with FC-radar and autocannons), 40 indicating calibre (40 mm) and 60 indicating year of design (1960).
