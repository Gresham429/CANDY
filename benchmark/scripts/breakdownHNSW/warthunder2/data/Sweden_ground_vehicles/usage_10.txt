Usage of Strv_m/39: 
The Strv m/39 has a similar gameplay style to the Strv m/38. It's a fast light manoeuvrable tank with excellent firepower and adequate protection for its battle rating. Unlike the predecessor m/38, the m/39 got a more heavily armoured frontal turret with 50 mm thickness, making it an excellent hulled down vehicle. The Strv m/39 like its predecessor has an excellent gun depression and is able to look over hills without exposing itself too much to the enemies.
