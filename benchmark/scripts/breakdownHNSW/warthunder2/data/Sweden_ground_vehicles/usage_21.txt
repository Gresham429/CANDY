Usage of Sav_m/43_(1946): 
Like the preceding 1944 model, the Sav m/43 (1946) performs best in the hull down positions, as it can use the gun depression to present a steeper angle on the frontal armour to increase its effective thickness. However, it commonly faces tougher opposition at this BR, including the very common T-34, M4 Sherman, and Panzer IV medium tanks, thus the armour should not be dependant on in case of a slugging match against these vehicles. The SAV m/43 shines with its allies in a supporting role, where it's not the main target for the opposition but can still do enough damage to the enemy target for allies to take it out. Its 10 second reload makes it not suitable for a frontline brawler, and should not be treated as such.
