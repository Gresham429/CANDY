Usage of Christian_II: 
The strv 121B can be used comfortably in both urban and rural environments, providing the vehicle's weaknesses are kept in mind (the sides and hull). While it is capable in most forms of engagement, it does lack the precision of the British Challenger MBTs or the extreme round velocities of the Soviet T-64/T-80 series. The 121B also has a particularly large and blocky profile, making for a particularly visible target in many situations.
