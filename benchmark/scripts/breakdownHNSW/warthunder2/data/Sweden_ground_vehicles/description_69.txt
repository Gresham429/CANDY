Description of Strv_121: 
The Stridsvagn 121 is the Swedish designation for the Leopard 2A4, leased from Germany in early 1994 to replace the aging Strv 103 and the Strv 104. A total of 160 Strv 121s were acquired from the leasing deal and all of the vehicles would be delivered to Sweden at the end of 1994 and early 1995. In Sweden, the Strv 121 would go through some changes like being equipped with Swedish radio equipment, reflective tape, and new lights for road traffic, but were also painted in Swedish army camouflage. The Strv 121 would serve until the early 2000s when they were initially phased out for the Strv 122.
