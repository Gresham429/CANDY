Usage of CV_90120: 
The CV 90120 has minimal armour only meant to withstand small arms fire and indirect shrapnel. Despite this, it's rather versatile due to its mobility, reload, and the powerful slpprj m/95 round. Your playstyle can make use of the autoloader, the m/95 round, 3rd gen thermals, and LWS (laser warning system) to snipe at long ranges (along with the added benefit of the CV 90120's mobility to reposition or get to sniping spots quicker), or you can make aggressive flanks to utilize the 5-second reload and take out or disable enemies before they can even react. Try to stay away from the frontline as your armour is effectively useless no matter the range. Its incredible reverse speed and acceleration will always make it easy to dip in and out of cover, retreat when damaged, or to simply reposition yourself, and with its autoloader, you can afford to lose a crewmember (during a firefight) while retaining all combat efficiency. With the slpprj m/95 round, you can penetrate almost all vehicle in the game from the front at any range (excluding areas such as the turret cheeks on the Leopard 2A5 series and M1A2, and some areas of Russian MBTs). The stock shell is a HEAT-FS shell and the DM23 APFSDS round is a tier I modification. Although entirely usable, it is subpar compared to m/95 round, but holds its own against tanks at its BR until a better round is available. You will just have to play more passively and know how to hit weak spots at longer ranges. Use your mobility to flank on large maps such as Maginot Line and (if you have them researched) use your powerful thermal optics to acquire and destroy a target. If the enemy is looking at you and you are too close, reposition and try to make them lose focus on you. By playing more to your strengths and keeping your weaknesses in mind more than you would a normal MBT, you can make the most of this vehicle.
