History of T-55M_(Sweden): 
Between 1960 and 1970, Finland purchased 74 T-55As from the Soviet Union to bolster the numbers of their tank core and complement the T-54s. At the turn of 1980-1990, all T-55As were modernized to the new standard, adding the M suffix to their designation. In early 2000s, most of the T-55Ms were retired with last 9 T-55Ms being used for mine clearance. By the end of 2022, all T-55Ms were officially retired from the service.
