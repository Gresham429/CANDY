Description of Pvrbv_551: 
The Pansarvärnsrobotbandvagn 551 was a tank destroyer built by Hägglunds & Söner in Örnsköldsvik, based on the retired Ikv 102 / 103 chassis, which were phased out by the Ikv 91. Stemming from the UDES 33 prototype, the Pvrbv 551 was upgraded, adopting an elevator mechanism for the Rbs 55 ATGM launcher. This innovation allowed deployment and subsequent protection within the chassis through a top-mounted two-door hatch. The Rbs 55, Swedish designation for the BGM-71 TOW, offered a commendable range of 65 to 3000 m, enhancing the vehicle's agility as a TOW system carrier. Despite increased mobility, the integration of a Ford V6 engine, shared with the Bv 206, compromised off-road capabilities compared to the original engine. Between 1984 and 1986, 57 Pvrbv 551 units were manufactured and distributed, finding placement in Armoured and Mechanized brigades as support vehicles. Serving in the Swedish Army until the early 2000s, the Pvrbv 551 earned praise for its economical and prompt deployment, effectively fulfilling critical operational requirements.
