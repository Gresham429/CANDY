Usage of Strf_9040C: 
Flanking or very carefully aimed shots are key as none of the 9040C's ammo types can penetrate the frontal armour of most MBTs found at the BR, but its high rate of fire means that penetrations are quickly lethal. Since the magazine carries 24 rounds, it is advisable to fire the weapon in burst of either four or eight rounds with an interval of 2 - 4 seconds in between, especially at range.
