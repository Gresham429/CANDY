Usage of T-55M_(Sweden): 
The T-55M has the exact same playstyle as the Soviet T-55A. The T-55A usage in battle is very similar to the T-54 tanks prior to it. Aside from some minor design differences, the general armour layout of the T-55A (and by extension, the T-55M) is similar to that of the T-54 (1951). The mobility is slightly better due to a more powerful engine, enabling a higher hp-to-ton ratio despite the small weight increase. The firepower of the T-55M compared to its predecessor is what makes it stand out, with access to the M1000A1 APFSDS ammunition that can penetrate over 340 mm at point-blank range (compared to the T-54 (1951)'s point-blank penetration of 299 mm with the 3BM-8 APDS and 380 mm with the 3BK-5 HEATFS shell). The high-velocity and penetrating APFSDS shell allow the T-55M to more easily reach out and destroy long-range enemies. The option to use the BR-412D APCBC shell is also available to use in order to cause devastating post-penetration damages, especially against the Leopard 1 tanks that the APCBC shell can penetrate frontally. However, the presence of other tanks with enough armour to protect against the APCBC shell mean it is only situationally useful. Other helpful differences the T-55M has over the T-54 (1951) is a faster turret traverse rate and stabilizer, the latter of which is very useful when reacting to enemy targets on the move.
