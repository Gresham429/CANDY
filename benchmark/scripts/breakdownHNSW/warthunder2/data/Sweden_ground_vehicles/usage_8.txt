Usage of Vickers_Mk.E: 
It is recommended to play the Vickers Mk.E in a support role, flanking the battlefield and finding a good position to support your teammates from. The 37 mm cannon has quite good characteristics with its rounds (APHE, AP) being able to deal a fair amount of damage to enemy vehicles from short and long ranges. The fast reload allows for quick adjustment of aim between shots, meaning the Vickers Mk.E can be a highly effective flanking vehicle if a good camping spot is found. The gun depression of 10 degrees allow it to hide its hull to be less visible to the enemy. Keeping back at long-range is certainly an effective way to avoid taking damage.
