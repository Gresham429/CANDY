History of Strv_m/41_S-II: 
In March of 1940, Sweden ordered about 90 TNH tanks (known as the Panzer 38(t) in German service) from ÄŒKD, but Germany, which had occupied Czechoslovakia in 1938, confiscated the tanks for its own use as the Panzer 38(t) Ausf. S. Sweden still needed the light tanks, and after negotiations the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license, and compensation for the lost tanks. Sweden ordered 116 Strv M/41 SI in June, 1941. The Stridsvagn M/41 was armed with a 37 mm Bofors m/38 gun, was powered by a Scania-Vabis Type 1664 engine, and the design utilized riveted construction. In June of 1942, Sweden ordered 122 Strv M/41 SII. The SII featured a number of improvements over the SI. The armour was increased from 25 mm to 50 mm thick. Because of the added weight of the armour, a more powerful engine was added, the Type L 603 engine. This necessitated an elongation of the hull by 65 mm. The fuel tanks were increased from 190 litres to 230 litres. 104 of the SII model were built, with the last 18 being built as the Sav M/43, a casemate assault gun using a 75 mm gun, and later a 105 mm gun. Another 18 Sav M/43 were purpose-built afterwards. The Strv M/41 served until the late 1950s, when all Strv M/41 were converted to the Pansarbandvagn (Pbv) 301, an armoured personnel carrier. The turrets were used in static fortifications.
