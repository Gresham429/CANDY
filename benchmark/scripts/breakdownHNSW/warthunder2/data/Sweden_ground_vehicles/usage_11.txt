Usage of T-26E_(Sweden): 
It is recommended to play the T-26E in a support role, flanking the battlefield and finding a good position to support your teammates from. The 45 mm cannon has quite good characteristics with its rounds (APHEBC, APBC) being able to deal a fair amount of damage to enemy vehicles from short and long ranges. The fast reload allows for quick adjustment of aim between shots, meaning the T-26E can be a highly effective flanking vehicle if a good camping spot is found. The limited gun depression, however, will affect which positions are usable. Keeping back at long-range is certainly an effective way to avoid taking damage.
