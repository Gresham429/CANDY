Description of Strv_103C: 
The Stridsvagn 103ะก was the final production variant of the S-tank family. In defense decision 1982, it was planned to withhold acquiring new tanks, which meant the existing tanks and the Strv 103s had to undergo renovations. The vehicles were improved with a better Detroit Diesel engine for better manoeuvrability, a laser rangefinder integrated with the gunner sight for better distance accuracy, and built-in dozer blade on all Strv 103Cs for better protection of the lower front of the hull, as well as side skirt protection to improve the overall survivability of the vehicle.
