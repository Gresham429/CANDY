Usage of Comet_I_(Sweden): 
Fighting a tank of the same weight classification is relatively easy, but can be difficult against the more armoured Panther A, IS series and angled Tiger tanks. Until the APDS shot has been unlocked, more decisive shots will have to be made to take care of these tanks, the Mk.6 and Mk.8 shot are the preferred ammunition to use. The Panthers should be targeted on the gun mantlet in the front and should be aimed at the gunner to immobilize their firepower and cause crew damage. The T-34-85 is a bit of a hit-or-miss due to the more heavy sloping nature of the armour and the turret. Penetrating through the front hull armour when it is facing directly at you is the best course of action against the T-34-85. Heavy tanks get even more tricky, but easier once the APDS round is unlocked for use. A Tiger I is admittedly an easy tank to deal with due to the vertical slope of the armour unless angled. Flanking should be used in this case. Problems arise with the IS-1 and IS-2 tanks that may show up, due to their heavy armour and the IS-2's tendency to absolutely wreck vehicles with its 122 mm gun. Distance is not your friend against this tank, the closer the better for your gun to penetrate the weak spots on its frontal armour. A tough situation, but a survivable one.
