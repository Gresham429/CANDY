Description of Strv_104: 
The Stridsvagn 104 were the last serving Centurion in the Swedish Army, in 1983-1987 where 80 of the oldest Strv 102 were to go through another renovation that were in dire need of modernization to extend their service. Strv 104 were upgraded with a new diesel engine and gearbox which would greatly improve the maneuverability of the vehicle. Along with that came many features inspired by an American-Israeli modified hull, which were designated Panturion, that proved to be superior to the British modifications. All 80 selected Strv 102 would go through the renovation assigned to Hägglunds & Söner AB in Örnsköldsvik. These improvements were worth-while for the Swedish Army, the new improvements increased the efficency of maintenance, making it easier to maintain the tanks in the field. These changes extended the service life but they would be phased out for the Strv 121 in the mid 1990's, all the remaining Strv 104 were then redeployed to Gotland where they would serve till late 90's early 2000.
