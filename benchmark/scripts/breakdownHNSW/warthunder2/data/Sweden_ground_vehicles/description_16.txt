Description of Lago_I: 
The Lago I was a Swedish medium tank, developed for export to Hungary. However, Hungary chose to design their own medium tank, with the help of Å koda, and the project was cancelled. It was not until later that the Lago I was trialed by the Swedish army and further developed to the Strv m/42, where it would have a long service life.
