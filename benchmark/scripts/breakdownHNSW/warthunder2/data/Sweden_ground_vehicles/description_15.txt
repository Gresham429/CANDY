Description of Pvkv_III: 
The Pansarv√§rnskanonvagn III is a  Swedish tank destroyer prototype designed in the early 50s along with the Pvkv II in an attempt to reuse the old Strv m/41 hulls. Even though the 57 mm gun showed great potential, the project got cancelled after the Swedish armed forces bought their Centurion tanks.
