Description of Strv_m/41_S-I: 
In 1939 and with the rise of tensions in Europe, Sweden purchased the production rights of TNH light tank from the Czech ÄŒKD company, which is actually the export type of the LT-38 tank. The tank was produced in Sweden and named Strv m/41, with a total weight of 11 tons. The Stridsvagn m/41 S-I was the first version of the tank made in Sweden, later an upgraded version was developed. Compared with the original Czech version, the Strv m/41 model had minor differences in appearance, the most noticeable modification is the addition of a periscope above the loader seat on the top of the turret. Once production started, the tank was quickly delivered between 1942 and 1943 and operated with the Third Armored Regiment.
