Description of Strv_101: 
The Stridsvagn 101 was the Swedish designation for the Centurion Mk 10. In 1959-1960, Sweden acquired another 110 of Centurion tanks from the United Kingdom, this time the improved Mk 10 to reinforce the existing fleet of Strv 81s. The Strv 101 were a fitting choice since the older 84 mm cannon were getting obsolete in usage and the older version Strv 81 would be getting upgrades to meet the standards of the new Strv 101 which meant they would get a 105 mm L7 among other things, but these wouldn't happen till 1964-1966. The Strv 101 would only get a upgrade once and would serve in the Swedish army until 1995 when they were phased out for the Strv 121. It had a long service alongside the Strv 103 as the backbone for the armoured forces of Sweden, playing a vital role in Swedish defence. Their fate is either dismantled or ended up in museum at the end of their almost 50 year service.
