Description of Christian_II: 
The Stridsvagn 121B Christian II was an upgrade package for the Strv 121 to meet the standards of the Strv 122. However, due to the Defence Act 2004, most Strv 121s were already in storage since the 2000s due to the widespread adoption of the Strv 122, which rendered the upgrade package obsolete. The upgrade project was abandoned with only one prototype made to this standard. The Christian II's upgrade was mostly notable in receiving the Galix smoke launcher system, improved electrical components to the turret enhancing overall performance, a reversing camera, and improvements to the maintenance of the vehicle which streamlined vehicle upkeep.
