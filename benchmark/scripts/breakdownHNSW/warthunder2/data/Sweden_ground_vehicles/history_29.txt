History of Ikv_103: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 72 was a project started in 1949 by Sweden for an assault gun. The intended role of this vehicle was to support the infantry in the attack, replacing towed artillery guns. The design was to be small, and of light weight, around 6 tons. This was to reduce costs so a larger amount could be produced. The first prototype from Landsverk, completed in 1950, was armed only with three machine guns. This was insufficient, and it was re-armed with a 75 mm cannon, the same gun from the Strv m/42. It was a small, lightly armoured vehicle, with a casemate superstructure housing the 75 mm gun. It had a crew of 4, and it was open topped. Starting in 1956, the Ikv 72 was upgraded to the Ikv 102 standard. This upgrade added an armoured roof for the crew compartment and a 105 mm gun replaced the 75 mm gun. The Ikv 102, in turn, was upgraded to the Ikv 103 standard. The Ikv 103 featured an improved engine, the Volvo B42 engine. The air intake was moved to grills on the rear of the vehicle, instead of through the crew compartment.
