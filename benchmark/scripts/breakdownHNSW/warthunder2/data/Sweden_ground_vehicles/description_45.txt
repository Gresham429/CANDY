Description of Strv_81: 
The Stridsvagn 81 was the Swedish designation for the Centurion Mk 3. Sweden acquired a batch of 80 Centurion Mk 3 in 1953, and another batch of 160 in 1955 with a few modifications from the later Mk 5 version like a new barrel with bore evacuator. The Strv 81 would serve in the Swedish army from 1953 until the 2000s as the backbone of the Swedish armoured forces alongside the Strv 103. They had an extensive service and would be modernized a few times throughout their service to meet standards as time progressed, becoming the Strv 102 and 104, but would eventually be replaced by the more modern Strv 121.
