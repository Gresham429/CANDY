Description of Ikv_91: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 91 is an infantry support vehicle designed and produced by Hägglund & Söner. The prototype of the Ikv 91 was completed in 1969 and the production began in 1975, being manufactured until 1978. A estimated 212 units were manufactured and supplied to the Swedish army. During the 1980s, it was clear that the Ikv 91's firepower was insufficient to defeat later generation Soviet tanks but still powerful enough to deal with lighter armored vehicles and infantry with its 90 mm low pressure cannon, as well as laser rangefinders for a precise first shot engagement to immobilize threats from a safe distance. There were plans to improve its weaponry with a larger-calibre 105 mm Rheinmetall cannon but the turret and hull were deemed too frail and unable to support it, thus requiring an extensive modernization of the platform and would be too costly. The Ikv 91 began its service in 1976 until they were slowly phased out for the new CV90 in 1993, the Ikv 91's service didn't end until 2002.
