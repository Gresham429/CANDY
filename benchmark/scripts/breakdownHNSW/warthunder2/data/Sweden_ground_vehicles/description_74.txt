Description of CV_90105: 
The CV90105 light tank was first publicly revealed in 2014. It was jointly developed by CMI Defence and BAE Systems Hagglunds. It was based on the CV90 IFV chassis, which was already combat proven and served with many countries. It used a Belgian Cockerill XC-8 lightweight concept turret, that was already present in the CT-CV 105HP. The concept was also related to the CV 90120, that used the same CV90 chassis and the turret from the AMX-10RC. The tank featured a stabilized 105 mm cannon, with an autoloader and it was meant to be operated in mountainous and urban terrain. An upgraded turret with a 120 mm cannon was proposed by CMI Defence, in order to increase firepower against other main battle tanks.
