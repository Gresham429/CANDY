History of Strv_104: 
During the 80s, it was found necessary to do something about the oldest Centurions in Swedish service, which were mostly worn out. The decision was therefore made to let 80 of the Strv 102s undergo a chassis modification in the period 1983-1987. In order to find out what type of powertrain should be chosen, a tank had been sent over to Vickers in England where it was fitted with a diesel engine and the same type of gearbox as in the Chieftain. It underwent comparative testing with a Centurion chassis procured in 1977 from Israel. This turretless tank was fitted with a powertrain assembled in Holland, a Continental diesel engine of the same type as in the M60 "Patton" and an Allison automatic transmission.[1]
