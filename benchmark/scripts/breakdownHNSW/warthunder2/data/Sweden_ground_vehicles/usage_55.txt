Usage of Ikv_91-105: 
When playing the Ikv 91-105, it's important to play like a light tank. The Ikv 91-105, although nimble, can be quite slow when stock. Overall the tank struggles to maintain a high speed, and will often lag behind other vehicles of the same class. The great compensation for this is the firepower. Thanks to a deadly arsenal of shells, along with a stabilizer, the tank engages any vehicle it faces with ease. Paired with a stabilizer and laser rangefinder, the Ikv 91-105 can comfortably attack at any distance. This makes the Ikv 91-105 very flexible, as you can use it both as a long range reconnaissance sniper, and a close range glass cannon.
