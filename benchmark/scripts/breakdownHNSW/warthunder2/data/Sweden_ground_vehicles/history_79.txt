History of Strv_122B_PLSS: 
In 1994, the Swedish Army first purchased 150 Leopard 2A4s from Germany in stock (all the first five batches produced), which were delivered in 1994 and 1995, designated by the Swedish Army as Strv 121, and later improved to the level of the Leopard 2A5. After that, the Swedish Army continued to evaluate the procurement of a second batch of more advanced main tanks, and in 1999 held tests with the modern NATO tanks of the 1990s: the American M1A2 Abrams, the German Leopard 2A5, the French Leclerc and the British Challenger 2.
