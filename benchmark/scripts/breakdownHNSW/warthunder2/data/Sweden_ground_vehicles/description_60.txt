Description of Strv_105: 
The Stridsvagn 105 was an upgraded version of the Strv 102R, with improved suspension for the tracks, thermal cameras, and new driver hatch. The Strv 105 was decided in the 1990s to complement FVM's procurement of acquiring new tanks for the Swedish armed forces. However, only one prototype was ever built, and the type never entered service due to Sweden acquiring Strv 121 and the vehicle platform became obsolete.
