History of Sherman_III/IV: 
After World War II, Sweden purchased a few surplus Sherman tanks from Britain for evaluation and to learn about foreign tank design. They were tested in field conditions. All of the Shermans did quite well in the tests and were praised for their reliability and ease of use even with inexperienced drivers, and while not being made for the winter conditions they were testing in. Even though the tank was viewed favourably, Swedish never fully adopted the Sherman nor did the examples they did obtain see combat service. Inability to purchase more with sufficient spare parts, and other better vehicles being available may be some of the reasons for this decision. The tallness of the Sherman, and the weaknesses brought with that height were a partial inspiration for the future Strv 103 which was focused on minimizing height.
