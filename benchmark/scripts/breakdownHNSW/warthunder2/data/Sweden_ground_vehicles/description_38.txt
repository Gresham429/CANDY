Description of Strv_74: 
The Stridsvagn 74 was a Swedish light tank in service with the Swedish Army between 1958 to 1984. It was designed in 1957, using the older chassis of the Strv m/42 TH and TV that were considered obsolete in the mid 1950s. The Strv 74 was intended to support the recently acquired Strv 81. The turret was completely redesigned to be able to fit a high-velocity 75 mm tank gun based on a modified Lvkan m/37 anti-aircraft gun which was also to be used on the Pvkv II tank destroyer project. The Strv 74 served in armoured brigades up until 1967 when the Strv 103 took over the role and the Strv 74 was transferred to infantry support. The Strv 74 comes in two versions, 74 H and 74 V, their only difference being internal layout and transmission. The Strv 74 V would serve until 1981, and the remaining 74 H would serve until 1984 when they would be phased out in favour of the Ikv 91. The turrets would become coastal defences similar to the older Strv m/41 turrets that became static defenses around airfields.
