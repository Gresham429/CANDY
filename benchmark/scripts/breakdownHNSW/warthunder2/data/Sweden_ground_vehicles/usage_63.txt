Usage of UDES_33: 
The UDES 33 performs best when using natural terrain cover, as it cannot take any punishment. It is advisable to sit behind the primary lines of the allied team, and pick enemies off when they expose themselves in the distance. Try to get the most out of relatively high ATGM speed - by firing from the sides and changing positions you can maximize the time it takes for enemies to notice the giant fireball flying towards them, sometimes long enough to get hit by them.
