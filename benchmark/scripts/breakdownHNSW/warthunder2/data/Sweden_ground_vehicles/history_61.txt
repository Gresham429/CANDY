History of ItPsV_90: 
The ItPsV-90, or Ilmatorjuntapanssarivaunu 90, is a Finnish SPAAG. Used for low-air defense, the ItPsv-90 was used to shoot down low-flying aircraft and UAVs. Orignally, the ItPsV-90 was on a Polish T-55 tank hull used in the 1990s. Finland had several units until 2010, when the systems were moved into wartime storage. Five years later, in 2015, the systems were installed on the Leopard 2A4 hull. The ItPsV-90 variant in-game with the 2A4 hull would enter service for the Finnish army in 2016 and is still in use with 7 units made.
