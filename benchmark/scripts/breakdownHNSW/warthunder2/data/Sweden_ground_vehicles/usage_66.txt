Usage of T-72M1_(Sweden): 
One of the key strengths of the T-72M1 is its armour. The quartz core composed turret will bounce many shots and can even eat up some ATGMs. In terms of armament, the T-72M1 boasts the very powerful and accurate 125 mm 2A46M gun that Soviet T-72A tankers will already be familiar with. Make sure to research the 3BM15 APFSDS round as soon as you can (after Parts and FPE), as the stock HEATFS round has some shortcomings.
