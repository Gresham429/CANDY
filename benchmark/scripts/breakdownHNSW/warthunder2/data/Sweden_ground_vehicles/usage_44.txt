Usage of U-SH_405: 
Thanks to the very high penetration of its HEAT rockets, the U-SH 405 can kill any tank it faces from pretty much any angle; this, combined with its near-instant reload and high on-road speed gives it great flexibility. However, the vehicle can be killed by anyone and anything, the main threats to the U-SH 405 are American tanks (and any other tank that has high-calibre machine-guns) and aircraft. Some tanks in particular, like the American T34, T30 and T32, should be avoided because of their multiple .50 cal MGs and somewhat high survivability against the rockets. Any tank that can survive inaccurate HEAT volleys (like the BMP-1) should be immediately attacked into turret or avoided.
