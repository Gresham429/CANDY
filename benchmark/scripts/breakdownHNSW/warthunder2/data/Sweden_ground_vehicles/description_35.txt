Description of SAV_20.12.48: 
The SAV 20.12.48 was a private venture by Bofors to design a next generation assault gun for both export purposes and indigenous use following WWII. The main goal was to make a light and manoeuvrable armoured vehicle with a 12 cm autocannon, capable of dealing with both soft targets and enemy tanks. A prototype was built during the late 1940s but no one was willing to buy it in a world that was littered in cheap surplus military vehicles and the project was scrapped.
