History of Strv_103-0: 
Strv 103-0 is the prototype series before the head series with Strv 103A was delivered to the Swedish army. After the trial of the two trial vehicles S1 and S2 in 1961, Sweden ordered 10 pre-series Strv 103 which would become the 0-series. They were not finished until 1963, where they were put on trial to be combined with different vehicles to see how to efficiently utilize the tank system in squad and organization attempts. These attempts would have a great impact on how the Strv 103 would be shaped and molded and so the evaluation of the Strv 103 began that would last from 1963 till 1966. It only took half a year before it was decided that the Strv 103 "S" would become Sweden's new tank.
