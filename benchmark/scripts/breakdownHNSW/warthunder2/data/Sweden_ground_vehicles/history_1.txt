History of Strv_m/31: 
The Strv m/31 was designed during the 1930s as a continuation development of tanks German designer Joseph Vollmer had designed. When the Germans took over AB Landsverk in 1920 they had the idea of a tracked and wheeled armoured vehicle, which during that time was not allowed to be developed under the Treaty of Versailles. From the design and idea Joseph Vollmer had in Berlin, this idea would continue to be developed in Sweden using AB Landsverk. The tank would be designated L-30 by Landsverk and, along with the development of the L-30 which had both wheels and tracks, there was a purely tracked model of the tank which would be designated L-10.
