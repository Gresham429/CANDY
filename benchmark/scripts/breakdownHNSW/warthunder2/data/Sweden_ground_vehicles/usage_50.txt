Usage of Pvrbv_551: 
The Pvrbv 551 is very situational, as the vehicle requires a secure sightline, preferably with a lot of distance. The Pvrbv 551 can be used in close engagement, when positioned behind teammates. But this is usually at the hope that your team will tank incoming shells for you. Since the reload is slow, and the launcher unable to fire on the move, the Pvrbv 551 struggles to safely engage opponents safely without any cover. When used behind terrain, the vehicle can safely pull back after launching, and can be difficult to hit due to the small profile of the launcher.
