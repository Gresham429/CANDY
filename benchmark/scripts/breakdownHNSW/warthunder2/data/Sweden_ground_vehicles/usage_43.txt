Usage of Ikv_91: 
Thanks to its excellent HEAT-FS shell, the Ikv 91 can engage any target, even when up-tiered. However, a margin of caution is still needed when going against tanks that have .50 cals, as .50 cals can go through the sides and turret to then kill the gunner, loader and commander. The good mobility makes it able to go from one objective to another very quickly. The laser rangefinder also gives it the possibility to quickly make accurate long-range shots. The -10° depression also allows it to take firing positions that some other tanks cannot (particularly the Russians that usually only have -5°).
