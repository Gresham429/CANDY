History of Lago_I: 
The Landsverk Lago was an interwar medium tank design. It was designed in 1936 as an export medium tank by Landsverk. One prototype was made to be sent to Hungary for trials, but the Swedish government banned exporting military equipment. As such, the Lago was given to the Swedish military for trials. There were six Lago prototypes. The Lago I had a twin 140 hp engine, a crew of five, a 37 mm Bofors cannon, and 3 machine guns. It weighed 15 tonnes. The Lago never reached the production phase, but it became the basis of the Strv m/42, which saw lengthy service in the Swedish military.
