Description of Pvkv_m/43_(1963): 
After the introduction of very successful tank destroyers in World War II like the StuG III and StuG IV, Sweden decided to make its own version with similar design philosophy, resulting in the Pvkv m/43. While the last tank was delivered in 1948, the design continued to be modified and upgraded during the 1950s and '60s. Some of the more important upgrades were the introduction of an armoured roof, improved muzzle brake, a gun travel lock, and a bore evacuator. When the Strv m/41 was retired, the Pvkv m/43 received two Scania-Vabis L603 engines per vehicle. While this produced less horsepower than the Volvo A8B engine used in the original design, the new engines proved to be much more reliable. In 1970, the Pvkv m/43 was retired from service, and the guns were used in static fortifications until 1995.
