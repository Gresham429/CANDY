Description of Strv_81_(RB_52): 
The Stridsvagn 81 (Robot 52) was an Strv 81 that was armed with the Robot 52 anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). This missile is essentially a Swedish copy of Nord Aviation's SS.11 manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) wire-guided ATGM. Shortly after the introduction of the Strv 81 in the 1950s, the Swedish Army tested the possibility to install anti tank missiles in Centurions and other platforms. During this time period, it should be considered that many armies envisioned ATGMs as the future of armored warfare, since they outranged most if not all cannons. Tests were carried out with a Centurion Mk.3 fitted with SS.11 ATGMs produced in Sweden by the name RB 52, but instead the army decided to use this missiles in proper ATGM carriers and scrapped the project.
