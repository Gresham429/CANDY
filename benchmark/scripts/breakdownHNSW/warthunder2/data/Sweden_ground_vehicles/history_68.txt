History of Strf_9040C: 
In 1983, the Combat Vehicle 90 group was created by representatives from many Swedish producers for high mobility vehicles with air defence and anti-tank capabilities in mind. In 1985, the chassis saw development and the first orders for the 40 mm Bofors cannons were done. A year later, in 1986 the prototypes for the Strf 9040 and Strf 9025 were ordered. The prototypes arrived in 1988. The vehicle entered full production in 1993 and is still produced to the present day.[1]
