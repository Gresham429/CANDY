Description of Pvlvv_fm/42: 
The Pansarv√§rnslavettvagn fm/42 was a Swedish attempt at creating a self-propelled platform for the Bofors 20 mm anti-tank/anti-air autocannon L/70 (Swedish designation 20 mm automatkanon (akan) m/40). The idea was to reuse the chassis of the failed Landsverk L-120 prototype tankette and fit it with the aforementioned weapon to trial the concept. The trials were somewhat successful and would lead to the development of the Lvkv fm/43.
