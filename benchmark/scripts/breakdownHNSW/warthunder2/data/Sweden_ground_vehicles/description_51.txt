Description of T-54_(Sweden): 
Finland operated 43 T-54s and 73 T-55s, acquired from the Soviet Union shortly after their introduction with the Red Army. The existing T-54/55 tanks were delivered between 1959 and 1972. At some point in their service, they were modernized, first to the T-55M standard and then to the T-55 AM variant. An additional 10 T-55AMs were bought from Poland and their chassis was used with the Marksman SPAAG turret to create the ITPSV 90. A total of 230 T-54/55s were in service by 2001 in different variants, 74 were in service by early 2003 and the rest remained in storage. During the 1960s, some T-54/55 turrets were used as coastal fortifications as the 100 56TK light coastal gun. The last variant of the T-54/55 (a mine roller known as KMT-5) was retired in 2022.
