Usage of Pbv_302_(BILL): 
Despite its real-life role as an infantry fighting vehicle, the Pbv 302 (BILL) plays more like other ATGM carriers in the game. Its mobility isn't terrible but mostly inadequate for large flanking manoeuvres, and its autocannon and missile react too slowly for close encounters with other tanks. As such, the Pbv 302 (BILL) fares best in long-range sniper battles. Use its reasonable mobility to quickly get to a good hull-down position and make sure only the launcher is exposed, then switch to the "special weapon or ATGM" (using a keybind or the multi-function menu) which will allow guiding the missile from the launcher's point of view. Unfortunately, the post-penetration damage of the ATGM usually won't destroy the enemy in one shot, but light tanks and some medium tanks can be overpressured by hitting them on the roof with the missile. Don't forget to use the autocannon as well; it can be used to take out lightly armoured vehicles and helicopters in order to conserve precious missiles.
