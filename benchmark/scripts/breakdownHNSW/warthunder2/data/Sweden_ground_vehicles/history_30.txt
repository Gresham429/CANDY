History of Pvkv_m/43_(1963): 
During World War 2, the need for tank destroyers became evident, and Germany had great success with the StuG III and StuG IV. Because of the success of those platforms, Sweden decided to create a tank destroyer similar in concept to the StuG's. Landsverk created a design in 1942, based on the chassis of the Strv m/42. It was chosen by the Swedish military and was given the designation Pansarv√§rnskanonvagn m/43, or Pvkv m/43 for short.
