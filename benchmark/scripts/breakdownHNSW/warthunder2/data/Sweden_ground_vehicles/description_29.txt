Description of Ikv_103: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 103 originated from Sweden's requirement in 1949 for an assault gun, that was meant to be light, cheap and small. The Ikv 72 fulfilled this request. But in 1956 the tank was upgraded to the Ikv 102 standard. Soon, this tank was also improved, and the Ikv 103 was born. Compared to the original Ikv 72, it featured a new 105mm cannon instead of the original 75mm. A new armored roof protected the crew, the original engine was replaced by the Volvo B42 and the air intake was moved to grills on the rear of the vehicle, instead of through the crew compartment.
