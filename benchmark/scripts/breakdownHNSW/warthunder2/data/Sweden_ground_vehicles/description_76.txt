Description of CT-CV_105HP: 
The Patria CT-CV 105HP is a prototype wheeled assault gun based on the Patria AMV (Armored Modular Vehicle) with a Cockerill CT-CV 105HP gun system. The design of the CT-CV 105HP makes it compatible with a variety of NATO APCs including the Finnish Patria AMV 8x8 chassis; the system underwent extensive tests in mid-2000s. While the turret system has been integrated with Korea's K21-105 fire support vehicle, the version with Patria AMV chassis has yet to secure orders from overseas customers.
