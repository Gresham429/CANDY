Description of Strv_m/42_DT: 
The Strv m/42 was introduced during the Second World War as Sweden's primary medium tank. Different versions were developed, however, one of the most experimental ones was the Strv m/42 DT (Delat Torn; "split turret"). Unlike most designs of the time, the new variant used a new turret, with a 75 mm gun and an autoloader. The name comes from the fact that the autoloader forced the turret to be split in half. In 1944, a mockup was made, with a prototype constructed in 1945, however after being tested in different trials in 1946 the design was considered unsuccessful and the project was canceled.
