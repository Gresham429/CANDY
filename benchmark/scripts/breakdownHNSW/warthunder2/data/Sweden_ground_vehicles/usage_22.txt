Usage of Strv_m/41_S-I: 
The Strv m/41 S-I has a similar playstyle to the original Pz.38(t) F, though it is equipped with a Swedish Bofors 37 mm kan m/38 which is the same cannon on the other Swedish light tanks and the Lago I. The cannon's regular APBC and APHE shells are a bit on the weaker side in terms of penetration, but it has a saving grace in its ability to use APDS rounds.
