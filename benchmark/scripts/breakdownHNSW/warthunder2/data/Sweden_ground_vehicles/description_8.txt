Description of Vickers_Mk.E: 
The Vickers Mk.E was developed as a private venture by Vickers to create a light weight, cheap to maintain and produce light tank. Destinated to infantry support three variants were created, the model A with two machine guns in independent turrets, the model B with a QF-3 pounder 47mm cannon and the Vickers Medium Dragon, that was used as a cargo vehicle, mainly as an artillery tractor. While the British army did not use the model A or B, it did use the Dragon model, and the base variant's found service in countries like China, India, Finland and Poland, the vehicle even inspired the Polish 7TP (a modified Vickers Mk.E model B) and the famous T-26 that was, in fact, a licensed produced variant of the Vickers Mk.E with domestically made systems, like optics and a 45mm gun instead of the QF-3 Pounder. The vehicle had very poor performance, however it was developed in 1929 and used up until the 1940s, so it's no surprise that it was severely outclassed by tanks like the Panzer III during the German-Soviet aggression against Poland and then in the Eastern Front or against the T-34 during the continuation war.
