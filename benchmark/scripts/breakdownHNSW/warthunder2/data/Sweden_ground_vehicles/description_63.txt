Description of UDES_33: 
The Underlagsgrupp Direkt Eld Stridsfordon 33 (shortened to UDES 33, literally Ground Group Direct Fire Combat Vehicle 33) was a prototype Swedish ATGM and SAM carrier developed during the Cold War around the mid 1970s. The UDES 33 was envisioned by the Swedish Army as a way to reuse the decommissioned Ikv 103 when they were replaced with the newer and more modern Ikv 91, they wanted an vehicle to fill in a gap that were left in terms of giving anti-air and anti-tank support units a vehicle capable of giving protection, improved mobility in rough terrain and improved ability to keep pace with main battle tanks and other armoured units. There were two prototypes produced and delivered in 1978, one was fitted with the Rbs 55 ATGM the other were fitted with an Rbs 70 SAM, through extensive trials in the early 1980s which would conclude that the vehicles were seen in a positive light and they would be approved for production, but some alteration to the chassis mainly and some components would be changed to the vehicle and the UDES 33 would be the foundation for the end productions that would be later designated as Lvrbv 701 and Pvrbv 551 in the Swedish Army.
