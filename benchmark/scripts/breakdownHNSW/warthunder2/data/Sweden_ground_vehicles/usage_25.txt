Usage of Pvkv_IV: 
The Pvkv IV is classified as a medium tank, but in reality works more like a tank destroyer with very vulnerable characteristics. Based on the Strv m/40L hull, it has an adequate speed of 50 km/h to move around on the battlefield and get into ambush positions. In ambush positions, the Pvkv IV can utilize its good gun depression which can change the gameplay of the vehicle in combat of certain maps. Open maps with hills and mounds can give extra protection and cover for the vulnerable vehicle due to the elevation and depression. Meanwhile, close combat maps like Sweden and Advance to the Rhine will be to its disadvantage due to the cramped crew space.
