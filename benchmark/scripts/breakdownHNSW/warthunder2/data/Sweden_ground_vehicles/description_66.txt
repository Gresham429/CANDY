Description of T-72M1_(Sweden): 
The â–„T-72M1 is an export version of the Soviet T-72A, carrying mostly the same characteristics of the original version in terms of armament, mobility, and armour, though the latter has some slight changes with applique armour on the front glacis. Finland bought a total of 162 T-72s from the Soviet Union and Eastern Germany to be used by the Finnish army. They entered service in 1984 and remained as their primary Main Battle Tank until 2004 when they were phased out for the Leopard 2A4.
