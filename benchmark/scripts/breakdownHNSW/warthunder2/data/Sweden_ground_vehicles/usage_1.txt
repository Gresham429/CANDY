Usage of Strv_m/31: 
The Strv m/31 is a light tank with poor armour. It shouldn't be used to rush into the heat of the battle or you will get knocked out very quickly. Its armour is inadequate, it can't even stop 12.7 mm HMG fire. Instead, it should be used to flank other enemy tanks, using your excellent speed to your advantage. The Strv m/31 has an unconventional armour layout. Its frontal area (e.g. upper hull, glacis area) armour is very weak while the rear is really strong. This tank also has pretty good speed in reverse, so you can drive into battle facing backwards using your rear armour and engine to soak up damage.
