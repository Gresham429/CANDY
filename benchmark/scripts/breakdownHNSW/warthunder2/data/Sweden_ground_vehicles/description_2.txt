Description of BT-42: 
The BT-42, officially known as "15 tonnin rynnäkkötykkipanssarivaunu BT-42 (15-ton assault gun tank BT-42)", was a modified variant of the Soviet BT-7 light tanks which were captured by Finland during the Winter War and Continuation War; due to the lack of firepower of the 37/45 mm gun on original BT tanks and the dire need for tanks to defend against Soviet forces, some of these BT tanks were then upgraded with a British-aided 4.5 inch howitzer and new turret that housed this very gun. These tanks were then deployed to the battle against Soviet forces; only one of these 18 tanks eventually survived the war and the subsequent scrapping of the surviving tanks.
