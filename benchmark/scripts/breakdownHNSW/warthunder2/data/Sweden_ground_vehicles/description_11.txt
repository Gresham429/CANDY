Description of T-26E_(Sweden): 
During the Winter War, Finland captured hundreds of Soviet tanks and armoured vehicles, including large amounts of T-26 tanks. While most could not be repaired, some were fitted with new parts, scavenged from other tanks and sent into battle. In fact, some tanks saw their turret replaced with that found in the Vickers Mk.E tank, while retaining the original 45 mm gun and 7.62 mm MG, some of the Vickers turret still used the 9 mm Suomi hull sub-machine gun however. The new tanks were designated T-26E, the E meaning "englantilainen" (English).
