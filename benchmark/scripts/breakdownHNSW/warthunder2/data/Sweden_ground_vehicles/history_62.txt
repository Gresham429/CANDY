History of Lvrbv_701: 
In 1983, the Swedish military gave a contract to Hägglunds and Söner to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Lvrbv 701 surface-to-air missile carriers. The Ikv 102 and Ikv 103, infantry support vehicles mounting a 105 mm gun, had become obsolete in the past few years. At the same time, the same companies were contracted to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Pvrbv 551 anti-tank missile carriers. The hull of the Ikv 102/Ikv 103 was plated over, in order to extend the crew compartment the full length of the vehicle. The engine was replaced by a Ford V-6 engine. The armament consisted of a RBS 70 surface-to-air missile launcher in the center of the hull, which was raised up through a circular opening in the roof of the vehicle - covered by a two piece hatch - in order to fire the weapon.
