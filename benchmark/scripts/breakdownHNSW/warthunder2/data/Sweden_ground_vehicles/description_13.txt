Description of Pbil_m/40: 
The Pansarbil m/40 was an armoured car and was used by the Swedish Army. Originally designed for the Danish Army, several units were to be delivered until World War 2 broke out, in which the remaining units intended for the Danish Army instead entered service for the Swedish Army. Pbil m/40 are similar to the m/39 but were manufactured by Volvo instead of Landsverk due to limited capacity from the latter. A total order of 30 Pbil m/40 were ordered by the Swedish army where they would have a new Volvo engine, an improved turret and change of the ammunition storage. Pbil m/40 got the same nickname as the Landsverk version m/39 of the name "Lynx", they were well liked within the Army and would serve within the Swedish Armed forces between 1941 to 1958. Only one version remains in Sweden and are located in Strängnäs at the military museum Arsenalen.
