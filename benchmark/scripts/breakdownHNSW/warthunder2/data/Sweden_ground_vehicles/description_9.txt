Description of T-28_(Sweden): 
A total of seven T-28s were captured by the Finnish from the Soviet Union during the Winter War and Continuation War. The seven T-28s captured were the only ones able to move on their own power due to lacking of tractors able to tow these vehicles, so most other T-28s were looted of anything with value that could be useful for the Finnish.
