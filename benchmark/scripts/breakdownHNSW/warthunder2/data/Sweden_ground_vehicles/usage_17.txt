Usage of Strv_m/42_EH: 
The Strv m/42 EH is a fairly conventional medium tank that distinguishes itself with its excellent gun depression. It thus excels in hull-down positions or ridge-fighting. However, the gun is quite weak and will struggle in uptiers against angled and well armoured tanks. Enemy tanks like KV-1 and Churchill are almost untouchable for the Strv m/42 EH to take head-on, but also tanks like T-34 and M4 Sherman can be quite troublesome as well to face head-on with the Strv m/42 EH's short 75 mm. If Strv m/42 is played properly it can be a troublesome tank to deal with for the enemy as well. Strv m/42 has a relatively decent armour for its battle rating, and the turret armour is well rounded for shells to bounce off it. The Strv m/42 EH's modest mobility and high profile makes it not the best for flanking manoeuvres, but its excellent gun depression makes it a great tank for ambushes from hills and elevated positions. Where the 75 mm is not enough for frontal engagement, it's best to retreat and find a position where the gun can take a shot at the enemy vehicle's side or rear armour.
