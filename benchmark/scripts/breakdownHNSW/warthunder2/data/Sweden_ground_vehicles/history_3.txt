History of Strv_m/38: 
The Landsverk L-60 was a Swedish tank developed in 1934, and included several advanced design features such as torsion bar suspension, periscopes rather than view slits and all-welded construction. The Strv m/38 was the earliest variant of the L-60 accepted into Swedish service, with 15 ordered in 1937 and delivered in 1939. Unlike other exported variants of the L-60, the m/38 did not see combat use due to Swedish neutrality during the Second World War.
