Usage of Pvkv_m/43_(1946): 
The Pvkv m/43 (1946) is an excellent sniper due to its amazing gunsight zoom, great gun depression and deadly cannon. This tank destroyer unfortunately cannot perform as well when played as a regular tank, as it lacks the agility, gun traverse, and armour to flank or confidently take hits. Thus, to best utilise its sniper potential, the player must memorise various spots for sniping on different maps.
