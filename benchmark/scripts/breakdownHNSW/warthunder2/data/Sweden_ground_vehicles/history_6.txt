History of Ikv_72: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 72 was a project started in 1949 by Sweden for an assault gun. The intended role of this vehicle was to support the infantry in the attack, replacing towed artillery guns. The design was to be small, and of light weight, around 6 tons. This was to reduce costs so a larger amount could be produced. The first prototype from Landsverk, completed in 1950, was armed only with three machine guns. This was insufficient, and it was re-armed with a 75 mm cannon, the same gun from the Strv m/42. It was a small, lightly armoured vehicle, with a casemate superstructure housing the 75 mm gun. It had a crew of 4, and it was open topped. The Ikv 72 was later upgraded to the Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 standards, receiving an armoured roof for the crew compartment, a 105 mm gun, and other improvements. The design weighed about 8 tons.
