Usage of SAV_20.12.48: 
The combination of high mobility, powerful explosive filler APCBC shells, and autoloader make the Sav 20.12.48 an extremely dangerous tank destroyer to face. It is fast enough to quickly setup ambush positions near where the enemy team is likely to pass by, and a careless team can quickly find itself losing up to seven tanks in less than 10 s to the Sav 20.12.48 lying in ambush. Ideally, the Sav 20.12.48 would also be in a hull down position, where most of the tank can be hidden since the gun is mounted near the top of the vehicle and the high reverse speed allows it to back into cover quickly.
