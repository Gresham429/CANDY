Description of Strv_m/40L: 
The Stridsvagn m/40L was an upgrade to the Strv m/39, which was also an upgrade over the Strv m/38. At the outbreak of World War II, the Swedish Armed Forces were not satisfied with their tanks in service, and the Strv m/39 was seen as too weak, and they requested a version with increased armour thickness. Thus the m/39 was upgraded with more armour over the years, but this was not enough. The turret mantlet was modified and a commander's cupola was added along with side hatches. These also received the upgraded armour of the Strv m/39, and were designated as L-60 S/III (Strv m/40L). The tank was also the basis of the L-62 Anti II SPAAG designed for Finland.
