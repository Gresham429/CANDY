Usage of Lago_I: 
The Lago I is a medium tank one has to get used to. It has a 37 mm gun with a short barrel similar to that of the early Panzer III's 37 mm KwK 36, which gives it inadequate penetration against better-armoured targets. Enemy tanks with an effective armour of above 55-60 mm will be a concern against the stock shell slpprj m/38 and the upgraded slprg m/39, but the 3,7cm slpprj m/49 might be sufficient when it is unlocked.
