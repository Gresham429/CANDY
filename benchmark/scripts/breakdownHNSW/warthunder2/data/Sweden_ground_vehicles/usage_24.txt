Usage of Pvkv_II: 
The Pvkv II is a classical tank destroyer that does best in a good hull-down position where it can accurately hit enemy vehicles at long range. The combination of great gun depression, a fully rotating turret, and an amazing gunsight allow for considerably more flexibility than conventional casemate tank destroyers. However, it is a very fragile vehicle, especially to air attacks and High Explosive shells, and must be played carefully accordingly. It is especially well-suited to long-range fights due to a combination of a powerful high-velocity gun and good optics, as well as the inherent fragility of the vehicle.
