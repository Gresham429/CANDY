Description of Ikv_72: 
In the early years of the Cold War, the Swedish Army envisioned a new set of armoured fighting vehicles capable of supporting the infantry. Serving as a replacement to the towed artillery pieces, the vehicle had to be produced in large numbers, yet mobile enough to manoeuvre with the infantry and fulfill their support needs. The result was a very small self-propelled gun designated the "Infanterikanonvagn" ("Ikv", or the Infantry Cannon Carrier). The first version adopted was the Ikv 72, armed with a 75 mm gun. 36 units would be produced and would see service until the late 1950s, when it started to be replaced by the Ikv 102.
