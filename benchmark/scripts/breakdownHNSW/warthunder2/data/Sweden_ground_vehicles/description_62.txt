Description of Lvrbv_701: 
The Luftv√§rnsrobotbandvagn 701 is a Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle equipped with a short-range Rbs 70 surface-to-air missile system designed and built by Bofors, up to 5km range depending on the weather conditions due to the missile being guided by the operator. The Lvrbv 701 were developed alongside the Pvrbv 551 using the same chassis built on the Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 chassis that were decommissioned but the Lvrbv 701 were only built on leftover Ikv 103 and were given a new purpose. Both Lvrbv 701 and Pvrbv 551 share similar production history, only noticeable difference is the armarments with the Lvrbv 701 being an anti-air unit. Sharing also similar issues as the Pvrbv 551 with an underpowered engine, making it sluggish off-road. A total of 48 units were built in early 1980's and wouldn't be delivered until between 1984 to 1986 they were used in limited service for the anti-air companies throughout their use in the Swedish service. The vehicle were decommissioned in the early 2000s.
