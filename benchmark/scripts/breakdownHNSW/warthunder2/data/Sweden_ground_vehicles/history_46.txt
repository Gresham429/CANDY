History of Strv_101: 
The Strv 101 was the designation given to the 110 British Centurion Mk 10s (105 mm gun) equipped with Swedish communication equipment that were bought in 1958. They were bought after the order for the 240 Centurion Mk 3s that were designated Strv 81. The Swedish Army would then upgrade them to the Strv 101R specification in the 1980s which included Renovation and Modifications. The Strv 106 designation, Strv 101Rs upgraded with new suspensions and fire control system, was proposed but never built.
