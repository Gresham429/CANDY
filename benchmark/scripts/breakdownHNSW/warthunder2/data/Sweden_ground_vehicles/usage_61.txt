Usage of ItPsV_90: 
When players first get on hand with ItPsV 90, they will have deja vu from a very similar vehicle in British tech-tree: Chieftain Marksman. Since both systems shared the same Marconi Marksman turret, players from British tech tree can get used to the gun very quickly; as ItPsV 90 now uses Leopard 2A4 chassis, it can now moves faster than its counterparts at its tier with ease.
