History of Pz.IV_(Sweden): 
The Finnish bought 15 Panzerkampfwagen IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV) in 1944, and another 40 Pz IV and StuG III, but only the first 15 arrived. Unfortunately they arrived too late to combat the soviets, but they were used against the Nazi during the Lapland retreat. After the war the Pz Iv (or as known to the Finns, Pzkw IV Ausf. J) was used in movies and as training vehicles.
