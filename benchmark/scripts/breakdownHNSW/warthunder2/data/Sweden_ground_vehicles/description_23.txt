Description of Ikv_73: 
The Infanterikanonvagn 73was an infantry tank that originated during the 1950s. However the design dates back to the Lago I, an export project that was meant to be developed as a tank for Hungary in the 1930s. However, since Hungary withdrew, the Lago I later became the Strv m/42, one of the versions of that tank was the Strv /42 EH, which was retired in the 1950s after the introduction of the Strv 81. Thus, the tank was remodelled and repurposed as an infantry support tank, designated Ikv 73. The tank remained largely the same, although the turret was modified to fit a new roof mounted machine gun.
