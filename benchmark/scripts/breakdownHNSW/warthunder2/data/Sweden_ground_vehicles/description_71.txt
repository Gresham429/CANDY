Description of ASRAD-R: 
The ASRAD-R (Advanced Short Range Air Defence System - RBS) is a short range air defence system designed between Rheinmetall and Saab Bofors Dynamics for use in different vehicles. This configuration is mounted in the American M113 APC. The system can use a 3D AESA air search radar with a range of up to 20 km or an infrared search and track (IRST) system, depending on the needs of the customer. Compared to older air defence systems developed in Sweden, the ASRAD uses an unmanned launcher high above the rest of the vehicle, which allows the rest of the hull to stay hidden or buried in defensive positions. The missile employed by the launcher is the RBS-70 (Bolide) that uses a laser beam guidance system. The missile is also designed to be capable of intercepting cruise missiles. Each battery of ASRAD-R systems also equips 4 RBS 70 MANPADS launchers.
