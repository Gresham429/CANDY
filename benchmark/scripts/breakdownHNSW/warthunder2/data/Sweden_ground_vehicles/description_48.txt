Description of ZSU-57-2_(Sweden): 
In November 1960, Finland ordered 12 ZSU-57-2s from the Soviet Union to replace the ageing L-62 ANTI II. This allowed for 6 anti-aircraft vehicles per tank brigade, and they were delivered along with 60,000 HE rounds and 10,000 AP rounds, as well as a number of T-54s, between 1960-1961. However, they were found to be severely limited by their inability to operate at night, and were eventually replaced by the ItPsV 90. The vehicles were withdrawn from service completely in 2006.
