History of L-62_ANTI_II: 
The Landsverk L-62, also known as the Anti II, was a self propelled anti-aircraft gun designed for Finland in 1941 by Landsverk of Sweden. It was based on the Anti I, but with an improved hull and turret. It was based on the chassis of the Landsverk L-60, a light tank design made in the interwar period. The L-62 had an extra road wheel, compared to the L-60. The turret was open topped, and circular. This allowed for better visibility of planes. It was armed with the 40 mm Bofors L/60 anti-aircraft gun. Finland ordered 6 of these vehicles in 1942, and designated them as the ItPsv 41, or Ilmatorjuntapanssarivaunu 41. This translates to anti-aircraft tank 41 in English. In the Summer of 1944, the ItPsv 41 shot down 11 Soviet planes. This protected the tank brigade from air attack. All 6 vehicles were used in Finnish service until 1966.
