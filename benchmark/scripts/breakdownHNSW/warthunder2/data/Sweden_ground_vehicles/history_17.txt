History of Strv_m/42_EH: 
Strv m/42 EH is a continued development of the AB Landsverk tanks designated Lago I, that Hungary had requested back in the 1930s. When Sweden in 1942 requested a new heavy tank from AB Landsverk that was going to be over 10 ton but below 22 ton mark and armed with a 75 mm cannon, this gave AB Landsverk the opportunity to continue development of the Lago I. In Swedish use it would be designated Strv m/42 and would come in 3 different versions during the second world war, the first version Strv m/42 TM, second TH which would have same engines as the TM but a new hydromechanical gearbox from Lysholm-Smith, third version EH which only had one engine with a newly developed A8B engine from Volvo while TM and TH used two Scania-Vabis 603/1 engines. EH also got a hydromechanical gearbox from Lysholm-Smith but this was larger and improved compared to the TH version.
