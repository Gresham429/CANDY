History of Strv_m/40L: 
In 1934, a new light tank was designed for Sweden by Landsverk, the L-60. It was based on the Landsverk L-10/Strv m/31, but with a new torsion bar suspension system. The torsion bar suspension system was a large improvement over the Christie suspension system. The L-60 S/1 entered service with the Swedish military in 1938 as the Strv m/38. The L-60 S/1 Strv m/38 was armed with a Bofors 37 mm gun. In 1939, Sweden ordered an improved version of the Strv m/38. It was designated as the L-60 S/II Strv m/39. The Strv m/39 was armed with an improved Bofors 37 mm gun and had a new engine. During World War 2, the Strv m/39 was upgraded with additional armour welded onto the glacis and mantlet.
