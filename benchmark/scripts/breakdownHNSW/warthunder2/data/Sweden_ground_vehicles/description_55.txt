Description of Ikv_91-105: 
The ikv 91-105 was an upgrade program meant to fulfil the needs of the Indian army for a new amphibious light tank. Although it never reached production or service with any army, it was considered by Sweden as an upgrade for their regular ikv 91s. SAAB fully developed the program, it included a new super-low-recoil 105 mm gun provided by Rheinmetall, since the vehicle could not sustain the pressure from more advanced 105 mm cannons. The commander and gunner also received new fire control systems, with IR night vision devices provided by SAAB. While India considered the tank, the vehicle was never adopted, and the same could be said about the Swedish Army, that considered the tank too weak for such weaponry, and instead used the strv 122 and strf 90 to fulfil the role of the ikv 91 in the following years.
