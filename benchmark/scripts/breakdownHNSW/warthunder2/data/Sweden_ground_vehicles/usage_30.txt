Usage of Pvkv_m/43_(1963): 
The Pvkv m/43 (1963) has a casemate design, and as such, plays best as a sniper. With mediocre armour compared to its peers, it will depend on positioning or tank support in order to survive to deliver its shots. Move with tanks to your front, or find a long range sniping position in order to remain effective and support your team. The main hinderance of the Pvkv m/43 is its size, which makes it an easy target when it is exposed in any way. In one-on-one engagements the Pvkv m/43 is better, since it gets to use its stronger frontal armour and competent gun to its advantage.
