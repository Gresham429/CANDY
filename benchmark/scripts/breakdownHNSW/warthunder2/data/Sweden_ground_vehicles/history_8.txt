History of Vickers_Mk.E: 
The Vickers Mk.E also called Vickers 6 ton was a private venture by Vickers to develop a light weight, cheap and easy to maintain tank that could be produced in large numbers and mainly be used in infantry support. As such, different variants were developed, including one with only machine guns, one with a QF-3 pounder gun (47mm gun) with two crewmembers and other variants developed by other nations. For it's time it was a very revolutionary design, and inspired many other tanks, like the Polish 7TP, the Finnish variant of the Mk.E with a 37mm cannon, and the famous T-26, that was in fact a licensed Vickers Mk.E produced by the Soviet Union with small changes and the incorporation of domestically made equipment's, like a 45mm gun instead of the QF-3 Pounder.
