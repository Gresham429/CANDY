Usage of Pbil_m/40: 
The fast speed allows the Pbil m/40 to get into positions where the enemy team would not suspect you. Take advantage of your 20 mm cannon's high rate of fire to quickly dispose of unaware tanks. If you are engaging someone in CQC, you should try to take out their gunner or barrel before trying to finish your enemy off, although you should be able to penetrate most enemy tanks frontally. You can also utilise its speed to reach capture points early before attacking the enemy, which will also help your team as you are essentially scouting for them when they catch up to you.
