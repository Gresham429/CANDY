History of Strv_m/41_S-I: 
In 1939, Sweden purchased the production right of TnH light tank from Czech ÄŒKD company, which is actually the export type of LT-38 tank. Subsequently, the Scania vabis factory began to produce this tank and obtained the number strv m/41. The Swedish self-produced tank is named Strv m/41, with a total weight of 11 tons, a length of 4.6 m, a width of 2.14 m, and a height of 2.35 m. The overall design is similar to the early model of Panzer 38 (t). The armor thickness of the body and the front of the turret is 25 mm. It uses a four-person car set, and the engine is a Scania Vasby 1664 gasoline engine, with an output power of 142 horsepower, a maximum road speed of 42 km/h, and a maximum range of 200 km. The Strv m/41 uses Swedish-made weapons. The main gun is a Bofors 37 mm m/38 tank gun, the vehicle-mounted Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun, which can penetrate 55 mm flat armour at a distance of 200 m, and the auxiliary weapon is two 8 mm m/39 machine guns. Compared with the original Czech version, the Strv m/41 model has detailed differences in appearance. The most obvious is the addition of a periscope above the loader seat on the top of the turret, and the shape of the rear of the turret is also different. Because it took a lot of time to digest the technology and set up the production line, the Strv m/41 tank was delivered in December 1942 and completed in August 1943. It was initially equipped with the third Armored Regiment.
