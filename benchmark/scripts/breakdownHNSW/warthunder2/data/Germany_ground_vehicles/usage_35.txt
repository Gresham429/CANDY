Usage of Pz.III_L: 
This tank is very versatile as it can do head on engagements, it's good at flanking, and features a rapid-firing 50 mm gun with excellent penetration capability compared to the other nations' medium tanks at similar battle rating. When it comes to the tanks survivability, it's best to keep a reasonable distance to the enemy target to keep the enemies gun out of a solid penetration range. The additional 20 mm frontal plate on the Panzer III L version makes its survivability much higher at long range combat compared to the older J1 version.
