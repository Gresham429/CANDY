Description of Pz.Bef.Wg.IV_J: 
The Panzerbefehlswagen IV Ausf√ºhrung J (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV J) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 161/2) was a special command version of the ninth variant of the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank family. The Panzer IV J command variant was produced after March 1944. This variant was modified by removing 15 rounds of 75 mm main gun ammunition and installing a new radio system, which included cables, transformers, and junction boxes. A GG400 auxiliary power generator was also installed. The Fu 8 (medium wave receiver) and Fu 5 (ultra-short-wave receiver) were the new radio sets. A Sternantenne D (Star aerial) for the Fu 8 was installed on the rear of the hull, while the conventional 2-meter antenna for the Fu 5 was installed on the roof of the turret in place of the Nahverteidigungswaffe grenade launcher. There was also a T.S.R.1 observation periscope and an SF14Z periscope scissor attached. The SF14Z could be installed inside the cupola, where the commander could see the battlefield through the open hatch. The T.S.R.1 was a long stick periscope located on the turret roof near the commander's cupola that could be extended via a pivoting support. Only 17 Pz.Bef.Wg.IV J tanks were manufactured from scratch, while the remaining 88 were modified from pre-existing Panzer IV J tanks.
