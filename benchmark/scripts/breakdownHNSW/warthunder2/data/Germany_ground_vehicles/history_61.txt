History of Ostwind: 
From 1943 onward Germany began to place more and more emphasis on self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (SPAAGs). This was because the Luftwaffe had lost their aerial supremacy they had maintained early in the war, as the Allied powers were able to completely outpace the German industry in terms of aircraft production. This lead to designs such as the 3.7 cm Flak auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen IV (sf) "MÃ¶belwagen", which was succeeded by the Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind - which was based on the Panzer IV chassis.
