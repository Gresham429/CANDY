Description of Elefant: 
At the conclusion of the Battle of Kursk, the German experience with the Ferdinand had been disappointing due to the constraints the large and heavy vehicle imposed, as well as desired improvements that needed to be implemented to the design. Recalled back to the factories in January 1944, the Ferdinand underwent design improvements such as the inclusion of a bow machine gun, a commander's cupola, application of zimmerit and other changes to the armour profile for better blast and shrapnel protection of the engines. These modifications were completed and began to be sent back into combat as early as February. By May 1944, an order was made by German Army High Command that the Ferdinand was to assume the new name "Elefant". The Elefant continued to see use, notably in the Italian Theatre and the Eastern Front, all the way until the Battle of Berlin in 1945.
