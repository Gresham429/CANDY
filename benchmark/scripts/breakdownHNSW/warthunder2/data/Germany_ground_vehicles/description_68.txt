Description of Pz.Kpfw._Churchill_(Germany): 
The Churchill tank was an infantry tank produced by Great Britain intended for supporting an infantry assault with its armour and firepower. The Churchill tank's first action was during the disastrous Dieppe Raid in August 1942, which saw a number of them committed then lost when the Allies were unable to recover the tank during their retreat. The Germans captured these tanks and subjected them through evaluations. Their initial impressions were poor, thinking the Churchill tank as obsolete. The captured Churchills were repurposed within the Wehrmacht in roles such as Beutepanzers or shore fortifications.
