Usage of VK_45.01_(P): 
One of the flaws of its armour design is that it cannot be effectively angled at all. Because of its front hull cheeks, that are only 82 mm thick, even the slightest angling makes them very vulnerable to all guns, and to make matters even worse, ammunition is stored right behind them on both sides (unless one carries less ammunition).
