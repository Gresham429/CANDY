Description of Brummbar: 
Seeing a need to create a new direct-fire infantry support self-propelled gun for the infantry, Alkett developed a self-propelled artillery piece based on the chassis of the Panzer IV medium tank in service. The vehicle became known as the Sturmpanzer IV, though it would become known more popularly by the nickname Brummb√§r (German: "Grouch") that the Allied intelligence assigned to it. With 300 units manufactured between March 1943 to May 1945, the Sturmpanzer IV saw its first use at the Battle of Kursk and was present at most major combat operations afterwards, proving to be an extremely effective tool for neutralizing fortified positions, enemy troops, and armored vehicles.
