Description of E-100: 
Towards the later half of World War II, Nazi Germany began the planning of the Entwicklung series of tanks in an attempt to standardize the tank designs. E-100 was the heaviest tank to be standardized in the E-series as an analogue to the Maus. The E-100 was proposed by the Adler company and they began development of the vehicle, though its progress was limited due to other priorities in the war effort. By the end of the war, the Allied forces captured the German factories and testing grounds, where they discovered the partially completed E-100 hull. The hull was examined, evaluated, and ultimately scrapped in the post-war period.
