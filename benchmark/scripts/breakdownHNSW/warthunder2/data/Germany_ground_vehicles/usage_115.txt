Usage of Maus: 
Versus heavy tanks, the Maus has all the advantages. While slower it can make up for this in close combat thanks to the good turn rate of both tracks and turret. Just quickly angle the Maus (both turret and hull) and you will turn it nearly invincible (be advised that HEAT shells can still penetrate the angled turret). Try angling the front drive wheel at the enemy tank and turn the turret so that the armour is at ~45 degrees to the enemy fire. The tanks that pose a threat are the M103, the M48, the Chinese T-62, the BMPs, the Object 120, and basically every tank that has HEATFS, ATGM, or APFSDS rounds that can penetrate more than 320 mm of armour. One good strategy is to capture the objective and just defend it. This can be really helpful to the team.
