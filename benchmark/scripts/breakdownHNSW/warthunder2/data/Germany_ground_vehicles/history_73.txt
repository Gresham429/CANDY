History of M4_748_(a)_(Germany): 
In the midst of the battlefield in World War II, wreckage and broken down equipment are often left behind by the army on the field due to either the inability to recover them or they are no longer operable. This equipment, if salvageable, are often taken by the occupiers and used for their own purposes. The Allies mostly captured German vehicles for use in gun tests and target practice, with the Soviets going as far as fielding captured tanks in their own ranks such as the Panzer III as the T-III. The German forces also captured Allied tanks as well, mostly fielding them in the Panzer forces to supplement the growing attrition of their armoured forces. The M4 Sherman, one of the most common tanks in the Allied forces, was often captured and fielded by the German forces. The fielded Shermans in the German army was given the designation M4-748(a).
