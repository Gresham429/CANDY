Usage of Marder_III: 
The Marder III should be played as a long range sniper, taking advantage of the APCBC shell's high penetration values, high gun accuracy and good mobility. Find a shooting spot and engage targets from at least 1,000 m away to prevent enemy progress towards the objectives. You will also suppress enemy fire to prevent your team from being pinned down by enemy snipers attempting the same in return. Because of your weak armour and open turret, always stay away from the frontline to avoid being flanked or swarmed and thus maximise your chances of survival. When engaging enemy tanks, prioritise firing hull-down from behind cover. With such firepower, any enemy wandering in your sight alone is practically dead. A flanking enemy, artillery strikes or CAS will be the greatest threats to the Marder III.
