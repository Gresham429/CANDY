Description of Pz.IV_F2: 
The Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausführung F2 (Panzer IV F2) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 161/1) is the late version of the sixth variant of the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank family. In order to combat the Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV-1 heavy tanks, the Germans began upgrading their Panzer IV F1 with the long-barrelled 75 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 40 L/43 tank gun in early 1942. The new long-barrelled 75 mm KwK40 L/43 tank gun provided significantly increased projectile velocity and armour penetration. The Panzer IV F1 served as the foundation for this upgrade. These were initially designated as Panzer IV F2 to distinguish them from the short barrel Panzer IV F1 variant. These were all renamed Panzer IV G after July 1942. According to certain accounts, around 25 manufactured Panzer IV F1 tanks were rearmed with the larger gun, which replaced the short-barrelled 75 mm KwK37 L/24 tank gun previously used for infantry support.
