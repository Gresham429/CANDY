History of Wiesel_1A2: 
The Wiesel was developed for German airborne troops due to their inadequate equipment used to fight enemy MBTs in 1970s. Requirements were that the vehicle is transportable by NATO transport planes and eventually is air droppable. Another requirement from the Bundeswehr was capability of fighting infantry and aircraft. Some prototypes were made by Porsche in 1975 but Bundeswehr stopped the project in 1978 due to lack of funds. Porsche continued developing the project cause of interest from abroad. In 1985 Bundeswehr ordered 343 vehicles. Out of these, 210 were Wiesel 1A2 armed with TOW launcher and 133 were Wiesel 1 Mk20 armed with Rheinmetall Mk 20 RH-202 20 mm autocannon. Both variants were deployed to Somalia in 1993 as part of United Nations forces intervention.
