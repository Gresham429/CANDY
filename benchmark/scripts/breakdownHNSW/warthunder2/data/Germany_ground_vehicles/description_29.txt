Description of Sd.Kfz.234/1: 
The s.Pz.Sp.Wg. (2 cm KwK 30 L/55) Sd.Kfz. 234/1 was the second production model of the Sd.Kfz.234 after the Sd.Kfz.234/2 and was a heavily armoured car reconnaissance vehicle with a simple open-top turret providing a 20 mm autocannon next to an MG42 machine gun to deal with infantry and light combat vehicles. The Sd.Kfz 234 series were primarily built as a further improvement to Germany's reconnaissance vehicles after learning of the effectiveness of said type of vehicle with combat reports of the Sd.Kfz. series 231/232/233.
