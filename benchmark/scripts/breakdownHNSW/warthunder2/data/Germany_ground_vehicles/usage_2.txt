Usage of Pz.38(t)_A: 
The Pz.38(t) A is used in much the same way as the Pz.35(t). It is lighter than and better-engined than its predecessor, so it can get to ambush positions quicker. The gun is slightly better, but the higher battle rating pits it against B1 ter and other armoured threats that it cannot deal with easily, even with its APCR shell.
