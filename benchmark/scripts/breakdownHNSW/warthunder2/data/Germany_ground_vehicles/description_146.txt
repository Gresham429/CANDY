Description of Leopard_2A6: 
The Leopard 2A6 is the seventh variant of the Leopard 2 main battle tank family. It is commonly referred to as the "long" Leopard 2A5 since it is nearly identical to the Leopard 2A5 variant but incorporates the new longer-barrelled 120 mm Rheinmetall L/55 tank gun. This version not only allows for heavier and newer ammunition to be fired, but it also results in greater muzzle velocity, range, and precision. Otherwise, only slight improvements are introduced compared to the previous Leopard 2A5 variant. Several subvariants were developed, including the Leopard 2A6A1, a command variant derived from the KWS I program. Additional radios (depending on the level of command) are installed in the vehicle to accommodate communications for section, platoon, troop, company, squadron, or battalion leaders. Another well-known subvariant is the Leopard 2A6M, a Leopard 2A6 with improved mine protection beneath the hull chassis and internal improvements to improve crew survivability. Canada borrowed 20 Leopard A6Ms from Germany in the summer of 2007 for deployment to Afghanistan.
