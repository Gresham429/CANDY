Usage of RakJPz_2_(HOT): 
The RaketenJagdpanzer 2 (HOT) is best described as a compromise when compared to its direct predecessor, the RakJPz 2. On one hand, the RakJPz 2 (HOT) gains the SACLOS, high damage HOT ATGM, as is the namesake of the vehicle - but on the other hand, it loses some quality-of-life features the RakJPz 2 had, such as good gun depression, the ability to follow up with a second missile and overall flexibility.
