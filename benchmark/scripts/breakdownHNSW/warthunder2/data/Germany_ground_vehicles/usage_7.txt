Usage of Pz.III_F: 
This tank should be played as second-line support or area denial vehicle, due to its acceptable speed and its accurate, potent gun, yet sluggish turret traverse even when fully upgraded. Avoid engagements at less than 500 m, where the armour offers more protection against low-velocity guns and the 50 mm cannon retains its penetration well. Always try to use the terrain to the Panzer III's advantage, it has a very nice gun depression so the Panzer III will have no problem with attacking over hills and various obstacles while hiding the vulnerable hull.
