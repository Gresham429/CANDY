Usage of Vilkas: 
The Vilkas is best played at medium range in a hull-down scenario, to use the Spike missiles and the cannon. In Realistic Battles, it is best to remain at a range (ideally further than 500 m) to use the Spike missiles efficiently, as they need at least 300 m distance to not overshoot the target. However, the 25 mm APFSDS is largely ineffective at range against heavily armoured targets unless shooting sides at a flatter angle. At closer ranges, it is easier to damage cannon barrels and tracks, but depending on the distance, the Spike missiles may be infeasible or unusable. Thus, playing at medium ranges is the best option for the Vilkas. Remaining behind cover allows the crew to be safe from all kinetic munitions, but still vulnerable to overpressure damage from explosive munitions. In addition, if the turret's ammunition is destroyed, a fire can occur. If this occurs, the Vilkas' position is easily given away by a large ammo cook-off and should be repositioned as soon as possible, ideally to a friendly capture point to re-arm. Rearming one 200-round 25 mm magazine at a capture point takes less than a minute. The excellent power-to-weight ratio of the Vilkas enables quick movements and rotations, especially in uneven environments. In addition, the commander's thermal sight permits the acquisition and firing of the Spike missiles while mostly concealed behind cover. However, due to the lacklustre payload inside the Spike missiles, multiple missiles may be required to destroy a tank.
