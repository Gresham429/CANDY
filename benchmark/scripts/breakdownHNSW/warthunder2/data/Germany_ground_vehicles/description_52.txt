Description of Sturer_Emil: 
The 128 mm K.40 Panzer Selbstfahrlafette V Ausf√ºhrung VK 30.01(H) (Sturer Emil) is an experimental World War II German self-propelled anti-fortification gun. It had a 128 mm Rheinmetall Kanone 40 L/61 gun (based on the 12.8 cm FlaK 40) and was based on the Henschel VK 30.01 (H) heavy tank prototype chassis. This gun has limited horizontal traverse but excellent vertical transverse, which makes it suitable to adopt a hull-down position. It had 15 rounds of ammunition for the main gun. The hulls were taken from the leftover of Henschel's proposal for the cancelled VK 30.01 heavy tank program (development of a 30-tonne tank that led to the Tiger Is), but the hull was stretched and an extra road wheel was added to its overlapped and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk roadwheel-based suspension system to accommodate the large gun breech, which was mounted on a pedestal ahead of the engine. Where the turret was supposed to go in the original design, it was redesigned and replaced with a massive open-topped fighting chamber.
