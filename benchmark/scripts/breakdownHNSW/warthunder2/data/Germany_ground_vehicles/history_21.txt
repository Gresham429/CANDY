History of Sd.Kfz.251/9: 
The m.Sch√ºtz.Pz.Wg. (Sd.Kfz.251/9) was developed over the Sd. Kfz. 251 platform, which was already proven alongside infantry as an APC and in other roles. This variant was made with infantry support in mind, thanks to the lessons learned in the Eastern Front and the need of a cheaper assault gun against soviet fortifications and entrenched infantry.
