History of Elefant: 
The history of the Elefant begins with the program to develop the Tiger 1, both Porsche and Henschel would compete and submit designs for trials, where eventually one would be chosen for production. Porsche's design was the infamous VK 45.01 (P), a design riddled with mechanical issues apparent even during the trials, while Henschel's design was the VK 45.01 (H) which would ultimately end up being chosen and would enter production as the Tiger H1.
