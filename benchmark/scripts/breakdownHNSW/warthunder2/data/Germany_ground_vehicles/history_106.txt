History of DF105: 
The Combat Tank DF 105 was a prototype developed between France and Germany in the mid 1980s by Thyssen Henschel with intentions of being used as an export vehicle, rather than for national use. The vehicle used the hull of the Marder I, with the French made FL-15 oscillating turret housing the CN105-57 (105 mm) which was meant for the AMX-13 series.
