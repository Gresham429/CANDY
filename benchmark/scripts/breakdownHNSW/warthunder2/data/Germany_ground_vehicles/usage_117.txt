Usage of JaPz.K_A2: 
With 3rd generation thermals on gunner optics, a laser rangefinder and one of the best APFSDS rounds at its rank against sloped armour, the JaPz.K A2 is a very potent sniper. Stick to areas with long lines of sight and utilize your superior long range firepower. Do not attempt to brawl, ever. The lack of stabilizer combined with the low weight of the vehicle means your gun will jump all over the place and will be slow to bring on target compared to its peers. Shots fired on the move are achievable only through sheer luck and it is almost impossible to squeeze a first shot if coming to a stop from full speed. If forced to close quarters combat like on urban maps, avoid direct confrontation: flank or ambush. The latter can be done extremely well due to your small size, excellent mobility and 4-second reload time.
