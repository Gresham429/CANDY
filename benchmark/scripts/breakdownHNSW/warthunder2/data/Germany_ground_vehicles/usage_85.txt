Usage of Ostwind_II: 
The Ostwind II should be held in reserve, for towards the end of the game when there tends to be a significant amount of enemy aircraft flying. It is best to avoid the front lines or beating feet toward the enemy tanks as the Ostwind II tends to be an easy target for a majority of the other tanks in the game.
