History of FlaRakRad: 
The FlaRakRad self-propelled anti-aircraft missile system with the Roland 3 surface-to-air missile system became the most advanced modification of the Roland, Franco-German anti-aircraft missile. While the army version of the FlaRakPz 1 self-propelled air defense system was equipped with a tracked chassis, the air defense services and the German naval forces settled on wheeled chassis for AA systems for airfield protection. At the end of the 90s, a MAN 6x6 truck was chosen as a chassis for the Roland 2 complex, but soon a unified command vehicle on the chassis of the MAN 15t mil gl KAT I A1 (8Ã—8) truck was adopted, which served as the basis for further development of the Roland family.
