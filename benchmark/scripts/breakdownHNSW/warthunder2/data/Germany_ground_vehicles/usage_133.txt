Usage of TAM_2C: 
For the stock grind, it is recommended to get to a vantage point and use your binoculars to scout enemies, only taking easy shots. This can net quite a bit of RP if successful, the only problem is that such maps are rare. This vehicle requires much map knowledge to play, as it has poor gun handling and depression. Combined with the high repair cost, the stock grind is terrible. However, once you get DM33 you can get a bit more adventurous, but one must still exercise caution as the TAM 2C has poor survivability. Try not to ever expose much of yourself from cover. The 3rd generation thermals allow you to see enemies that few others on your team can see, as the TAM 2C is one of the few German ground vehicle to get 3rd gen thermals, or anything higher than 1st gen in the gun sight other than the Leopard 2 PL. It is recommended not to push corners, as the TAM has little armour, the engine is in the front (so you are immobilized at best) and the turret is mounted on the back of the tank, so you have to expose a lot of the vehicle in order to peek. The Laser Warning System (LWS) allows you to know when you are "painted" by laser rangefinders or designators, so you can duck back into cover whenever you are seen by an enemy. Finally, the DM63 APFSDS lets you to be much more risk-taking as you can now penetrate things like the Abrams's LFP, and more reliably penetrate the turret weakspots on Russian tanks like the T-80U. The machine guns, although with a lower rate of fire than the MG3 on most other German tanks of the BR, can elevate higher than the gun, so you can engage helicopters better.
