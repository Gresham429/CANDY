Description of StuG_III_A: 
The Sturmgeschütz III Ausführung A (StuG III A) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 142) is the first variant of the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun family. It was the most-produced fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle, as well as the second-most-produced German armoured combat vehicle of any type, following the Sd.Kfz. 251 half-track. It was designed on a Panzer III F chassis that had been slightly modified, with the turret removed to be replaced by an armoured, fixed superstructure holding a more powerful gun. Originally designed as a mobile assault gun for direct-fire infantry support, the overall StuG III designs were continually upgraded and, like the subsequent Jagdpanzer vehicles, were used as a tank destroyer later during World War II. While the StuG III did not see action during the battle in Poland in September 1939, the experience acquired there highlighted the importance of a self-propelled mobile artillery vehicle.
