History of Pz.38(t)_n.A.: 
By 1942, action in Operation Barbarossa had seen the Pz.38(t) lose its capability as a regular tank, instead preforming reconnaissance missions, but production capacity for Pz.38(t) chassis still remained. As a solution Pz.38(t) n.A., which stood for Neuer Art, was a proposed modernized version of the Pz.38(t), but was rejected and Pz.38(t) chassis were instead used to build other vehicles such as the Marder III and Hetzer.
