History of E-100: 
Late in World War II, Germany started a project meant to standardize their tank designs. A similar attempt at this started in 1943 with the Panther II, which would use parts from the Tiger II to simplify construction, but this fell through with the cancellation of the Panther II. The new tank standardization project was known as the Entwicklung series, or the "E-series", and was meant to fix the issue of poor production quality and increase the production rate. The series was named with "E" followed by the weight classification of the design which would also indicate its role. E-5, for example, would be a vehicle between 5-10 tons and would be the basis of new light tanks. The series followed with the E-10 (tank destroyer), E-25, E-50 (medium tanks), E-75 (heavy tank), and the super-heavy E-100. Aside from standardization in parts such as the wheel (which was the Tiger II's design), the E-series does not provide many other improvements to existing armour designs, an example is that the E-50 and E-75 series are essentially a redesigned Panther and Tiger II respectively.
