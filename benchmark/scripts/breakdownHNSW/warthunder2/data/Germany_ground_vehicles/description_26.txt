Description of Sd.Kfz._140/1: 
The Aufklärungspanzer 38(t) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 140/1) was a reconnaissance vehicle used by the German Army during World War II. Its task was to scout out enemy positions ahead of the main attack column. They would then radio back the number of hostile forces and their location. They might occasionally direct an artillery or airstrike. German half-tracked and wheeled armoured cars were used for armoured reconnaissance but suffered in the tough circumstances of the Eastern Front. The Aufklärungspanzer 38(t) was intended to replace both of these vehicles as a key reconnaissance vehicle. It was outfitted with a 'Hangelafette turret' armed with a 20 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 38 autocannon and a single 7.92 mm MG42 light machine gun capable of anti-aircraft and ground fire.
