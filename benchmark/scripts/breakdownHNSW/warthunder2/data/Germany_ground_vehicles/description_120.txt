Description of KPz-70: 
In August 1963, an agreement was signed between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) to cooperate on the development of a new main battle tank for both militaries. The tank, designated in the United States as the MBT-70 and in Germany as the KPz-70, was to be produced by General Motors in the US and by Deutsche Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) in Germany. As part of the design process, the differentiating factor between the tank and their manufactured location was the allowance for Germany to utilize their own domestic systems in the installed components, though some German-designed components saw use in the American design as well. However, conflicts in the design requirements and expectations of the vehicles led to constant strife and delays, such as Germany's preference for a high-velocity tank cannon over the Shillelagh gun/launcher the Americans wanted to pursue. As development continued, the program came under review due to new complications regarding weight, and after the review in January 1970 determined the additional design and engineering changes would result in a higher program cost and unit price cost, it was decided that to terminate the joint program, allowing Germany and US to continue their design on their own. Free from needing to compromise with American needs, Germany took the experience and components gained from the MBT-70/KPz-70 development and placed them towards their next-generation tank design, which would become the Leopard 2.
