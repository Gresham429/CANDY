Usage of Sd.Kfz.251/9: 
The Sd.Kfz.251/9 is a lightly armoured vehicle that can be penetrated by nearly anything, including heavy machine guns, and destroyed by overpressure. This means you want to avoid rushing points and areas of high traffic, and instead flank the enemy team with your decent mobility. The 75 mm gun on the 251/9 is excellent at its BR, coming with an APCBC shell with moderate penetration and an excellent HEAT shell with good explosive filler and 100 mm of penetration at all angles. However, sniping with this tank is not recommended, as its gun and shells have low muzzle velocity and high drop, making it difficult to hit your targets at range. A better way to use this tank is in an ambush role. If you can find a good spot that protects your sides and flanks from enemy tanks, you can surprise and quickly destroy almost enemy tank that come your way with your excellent reload speed and HEAT shells. It also has excellent depression, allowing you to engage enemy targets over ridges and give you more combat flexibility.
