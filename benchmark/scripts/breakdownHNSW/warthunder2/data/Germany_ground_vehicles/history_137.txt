History of Ozelot: 
The Wiesel 2 entered service in 2001. This new vehicle was larger, faster, stronger, and more advanced than its predecessor. The Wiesel 2 was outfitted with a more advanced engine and fuel injector along with automatic transmission. The vehicle also saw an upgrade in armour, as it was slightly more advanced than the Wiesel 1's. Lastly the Wiesel 2 received an air conditioning system for the crew's comfort in the small tankette, and an integrated NBC protection system to ensure the crew's safety against nuclear and chemical threats.
