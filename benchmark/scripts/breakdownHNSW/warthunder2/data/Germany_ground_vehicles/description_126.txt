Description of RakJPz_2_(HOT): 
The RakJPz 2 (HOT) was a further development of the previous RaketenJagdpanzer 2, mounting the HOT ATGM which used a far superior Semi-Active guidance system (SACLOS) compared to the SS.11's Manual system (MCLOS). The HOT-upgraded RakJPz 2s served until 2005 upgraded up to Jaguar 1A3 standard, while the TOW-equipped Jaguar 2 was retired in 1993, also an upgrade from the RakJPz 2s. The RaketenJagdpanzers operated under a doctrinal plan to engage Soviet armour at ranges of 1.5 to 3 kilometres using their missile armament, which was generally assessed to have higher accuracy than contemporary tank cannons at those ranges on initial deployment. The RakJPz 2 (HOT) and later Jaguar 1/1A3s could be fully NBC protected, as they used an autoloading system which replenished the TOW launchers without human interference.
