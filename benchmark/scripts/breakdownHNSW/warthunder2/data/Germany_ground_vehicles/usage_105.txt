Usage of Marder_1A3: 
The Marder 1A3 is best used carefully, since most shells will penetrate your armour easily. The best tactic when hunting for enemy tanks is to hide behind cover and only expose your missile launcher or turret due to the smaller target. The Marder is highly capable of taking on air targets such as enemy close air support and helicopters. The 20mm gun is best used for air targets or enemy light tanks. If played correctly, the Marder can be a terror to the enemy team for both ground targets and air targets.
