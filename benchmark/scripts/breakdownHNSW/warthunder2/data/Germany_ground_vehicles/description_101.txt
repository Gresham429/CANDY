Description of SPz_12-3_LGS: 
The SPz 12-3 LGS is based on the HS.30, a German Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which was also the first IFV in the world. Unfortunately, being the first in any field has consequences, and the HS.30 was quickly outpaced by first the Soviet Union's BMP-1 and a mere 4 years later (from the SPz 12-3 LGS's deployment) by the Marder family of IFVs in the Bundeswehr. Due to performance shortfalls and a rocky development history, the vehicle's initial 10,680 strong order was drastically slashed to just 2,176 vehicles, of which the SPz 12-3 LGS was a part of. The most notable change from the HS.30 to the SPz 12-3 LGS is the very noticeable 106 mm recoilless rifle that takes up the infantry compartment, which augmented the vehicle's lethality against enemy armoured vehicles with its high-penetration chemical rounds. The SPz 12-3 LGS was produced starting 1965 as a conversion of the HS.30, but all HS.30-derived vehicles were all but retired by the 1980 mark as the Bundeswehr transitioned to the Marder series of IFVs as well as the Raketenjagdpanzer series of tank destroyers in a transition to more effective, reliable vehicles.
