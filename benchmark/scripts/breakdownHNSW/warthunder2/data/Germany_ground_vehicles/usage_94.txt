Usage of Elefant: 
The Elefant's natural role is as a long-range sniper thanks to its excellent firing range and frontal armour of more than 200 mm. Due to the frontal armour, this tank destroyer should always face the enemy to make use of it. Even though the Elefant is a heavy tank destroyer, it can rapidly drive backwards, which allows it to reposition more quickly than Soviet tank destroyers like the the SU-152 and the ISU-152.
