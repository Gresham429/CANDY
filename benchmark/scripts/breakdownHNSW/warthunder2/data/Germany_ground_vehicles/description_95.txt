Description of 38_cm_Sturmm%C3%B6rser: 
The infamous 38 cm Sturmmörser, better known as the Sturmtiger, had its genesis in from the Battle of Stalingrad where a heavy support vehicle with a large armament capable of demolishing building was desired. While the similar Brummbär was also produced to fulfill this role, the improving trend of infantry-portable anti-tank firepower gave concern that the Brummbär's armour would not be sufficient, and so a vehicle with more armour was desired. As a result, several Tiger I hulls were assigned to be converted by Alkett into an assault gun holding the impressive 380 mm rocket launcher. The vehicle would begin limited production in February 1944 before entering full production in April, leading to 18 vehicles being converted into the Sturmtiger. The Sturmtiger was used most famously in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, but also saw use against the Western Front in the Ardennes Offensive as well as the Battle of Remagen.
