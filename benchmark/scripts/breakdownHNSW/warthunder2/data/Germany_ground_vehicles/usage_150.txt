Usage of Leopard_2_PL: 
The 2PL playstyle is identical to the 2A4 and subsequent German MBTs. However, the 2PL may be able to utilize hull down tactics more effectively due to the additional turret armor. In terms of armament, the 2PL has the powerful Rh120 L/44 which German tankers are already familiar with.
