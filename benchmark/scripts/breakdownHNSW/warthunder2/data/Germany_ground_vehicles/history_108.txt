History of Leopard_I: 
The project for the Leopard started as far back as 1956 as an attempt to replace the American M47 and M48 Patton tanks in service at the time as they were becoming outdated to newer anti-tank technology. These American tanks did not fit the tactical concepts Germany had developed at great expense during the Second World War, so a new design was sought which would integrate this knowledge and also rebuild the German armaments industry.
