Usage of Flakpanzer_341: 
The Flakpanzer 341 should be used as a vehicle of its class. It has the armament and fire rate to take out aircraft but lacks the penetration rates to effectively combat heavier tanks. Remember that the lead on the Flakpanzer 341 is less than on the Bofors due to its higher velocity (914m/s vs 874m/s) while having better damage. The Flakpanzer 341 can also go hunt light tanks, which rarely have the armour to stand up against the 49 mm penetration, but make sure that the Flakpanzer 341's firepower destroy them before they get a chance to shoot the Flakpanzer 341. Here is a list of some of the vehicles the Flakpanzer 341 can take on:
