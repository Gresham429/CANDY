Description of Pz.IV_G: 
The Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausführung G (Panzer IV G) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 161/2) is the seventh variant of the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank family. The Panzer IV G variant effectively changed the Panzer IV's overall combat purpose. While all previous variants were primarily meant to engage fortifications and entrenched positions in support of the infantry, the Panzer IV G was the first entirely new variant to receive a significant increase in firepower against armoured targets. Previously, Panzer IIIs were usually assigned to such tasks. Aside from its rearmament with the long-barrelled 75 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 40 L/43 tank gun, relatively few modifications were made to its overall design in comparison to the earlier Panzer IV F2 variant. The production of this variant began in 1942, considerably assisting the German armoured divisions in fighting more effectively against the well-armoured enemy tanks on the Eastern Front and in North Africa.
