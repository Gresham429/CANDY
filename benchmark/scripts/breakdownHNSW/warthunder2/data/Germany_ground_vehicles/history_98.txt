History of Tiger_II_(H)_Sla.16: 
The Sla.16 diesel engine developed by Simmering-Graz-Pauker from Vienna. With a power output of around 750 hp, it was considerably more powerful than Maybach engine used by the Tiger I, Tiger II, and Panther tanks that had 690 hp. The Sla.16 was also proposed as the power unit for the infamous super-heavy Maus tank. According to various of sources such as Military Engineer and Amazing Porsche and Volkswagen Story, the engines were tested with positive results. The recommendation was that these diesel engines were to be attached to the heavy tanks and tank destroyers currently in production for increased efficiency of the vehicles. A diesel engine was mounted onto a Tiger II as a prototype built by Nibelungen Werke and went through testing, though results have not been found from this test. Further proposals also wanted the engine to be mounted in the Panther and Jagdtiger vehicles for increased power, but the war's constraint on supplies and Nazi Germany's capitulation resulted in the cancellation of these programs.
