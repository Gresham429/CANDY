Usage of T_34_747_(r)_(Germany): 
While it is a heavier beast (due to its applique armour on the front) than its mod.42 in-tree Soviet counterpart, it presents a slightly different playstyle, because the player will face the original T-34s. As a captured vehicle, the player will have to apply the same strategies as they would play a normal T-34. The player will reap success against other T-34 users, due to the F-34 cannon's ability to punch through hull weak spots and wreck them from the inside with the high amount of explosive filler in each shell. Hitting the turret ring is also a viable option, but it will struggle to go through the gun mantlet. Applique armour on the front, if unangled, can also stop the occasional shell. It is always recommended to angle the front if facing any opponent listed below. The tank doesn't possess an add-on armour option, but the spare tracks cover both sides providing a few additional millimetres of armour when angling. It is not much, but it is there. The tank also has its front mudguards removed, which leaves your tracks exposed and will be a problem in any engagement. Cover your sides, engage at the medium to close range, and you will reap the rewards.
