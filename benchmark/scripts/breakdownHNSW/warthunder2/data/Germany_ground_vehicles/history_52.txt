History of Sturer_Emil: 
The Selbstfahrlafette auf VK30.01(H), or better known as the Sturer Emil (Stubborn Emil), was a heavy self-propelled anti-tank gun developed by Nazi Germany sometime in 1941 and 1942. The Sturer Emil mounted the extremely large 12.8 cm gun on a extended chassis from the cancelled Henschel VK 30.01 armoured vehicle. The gun was laid on the back with the engine in the middle and the driver up front.
