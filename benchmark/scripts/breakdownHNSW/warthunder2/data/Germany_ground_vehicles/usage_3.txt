Usage of Pz.38(t)_F: 
The Pz.38(t) F is used in much the same way as the Pz.38(t) A. It is heavier and better armoured than its predecessor, but it still can get to ambush positions quickly. The gun is the same, but the higher battle rating pits it against better armoured threats that it cannot deal with easily, even with its APCR shell.
