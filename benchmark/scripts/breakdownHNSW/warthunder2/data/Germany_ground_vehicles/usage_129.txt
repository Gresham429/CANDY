Usage of VT1-2: 
The VT1-2 excels when it comes to acceleration, high speed and low profile. This provides the opportunity to move into sniping positions early in the game or even capture midpoints. The tank is easily destroyed and should be played as if it was a glass cannon, i.e. you stay behind cover/concealment and scan the area using binoculars and/or the third-person view and then only moving into firing position when the coast is clear.
