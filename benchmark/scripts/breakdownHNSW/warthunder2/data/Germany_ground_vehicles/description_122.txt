Description of T-72M1_(Germany): 
The â—ŠKPz T-72M1 was the final tank delivered to East Germany by the Warsaw Pact during the 1980s, with the intention of it becoming their new spearhead in case the Cold War escalated into a full-scale world war. The NVA used various versions of the T-72, but all of them were either from the Soviet Union (T-72 and T-72A) or from other Warsaw Pact countries with license-produced variants (T-72M and T-72M1). This model represents the export/licensed T-72M1, which had mostly identical performance to the Soviet T-72A Mod. 1983 (an upgraded T-72A with additional plates on the UFP which is a researchable upgrade to the T-72A in-game) after domestic upgrades were made in East Germany. These tanks were never used in war and were subsequently transferred to the Heer for evaluation or sale.
