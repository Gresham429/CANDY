History of Pz.II_C: 
In 1934, the development of the new German tanks, which would be the Panzer III and Panzer IV, was falling behind schedule despite an urgent need for tanks. As a stopgap solution until the designs were finalized, the Germany Army submitted a request for a new tank, giving the responsibility of designing to Krupp, MAN, Henschel, and Daimler-Benz. The product was a design based off the German Panzer I light tank, but was larger with the addition of an extra bogie wheel and had a 20 mm autocannon as its main armament. The finished tank was designated the Panzer II and production was to start in 1935, but tank deliveries did not start until 18 months later. At this time, it was in a low rate production status by 1936. By the time the Panzer II reached the Ausf. C designation, it was fitted with an improved suspension system to support the tank's weight. The changes included five larger wheels attached to new leaf springs. In 1937, the Ausf. C entered full production with MAN and other manufacturers. Over 1,600 Panzer II light tanks were produced between 1937 to 1942.
