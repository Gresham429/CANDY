Description of Gepard: 
The Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer (Flakpanzer) Gepard is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun designed to operate in all weather conditions. It was created in the 1960s, deployed in the 1970s, and has since been updated several times with cutting-edge technologies to keep up with modern warfare. It is equipped with twin 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons mounted on the chassis of a Leopard 1 main battle tank and has served as a cornerstone of air defence for the German Army and several other NATO countries. The turret has a full traverse, providing complete coverage for the system. The search and tracking radars are also mounted on the chassis, behind and in front of the turret, respectively.
