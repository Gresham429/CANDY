Description of Ostwind: 
The Flakpanzer IV "Ostwind" (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 161/3) is the second variant of the Flakpanzer IV self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. It was created in 1944 as a replacement for the previous variant, the Flakpanzer IV "Wirbelwind". The same Panzer IV medium tank chassis was used, but this time with an open-top, hexagonal turret housing a 37 mm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 43. This platform is highly effective against lightly armoured vehicles and minor fortifications in addition to its intended role as an anti-aircraft weapon. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but due to the heavy smoke generated by the main armament, this was not possible.
