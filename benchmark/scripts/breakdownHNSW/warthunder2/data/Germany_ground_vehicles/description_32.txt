Description of Sd.Kfz.234/2: 
The s.Pz.Sp.Wg. (5 cm 39/1 L60) Sd.Kfz.234/2 is the first production variant and most well-known version of the Sd.Kfz.234 family, a heavy armoured car used mainly as a reconnaissance vehicle, featuring the turret of the prototype VK 16.02 Leopard housing a 50 mm KwK 39 cannon next to an MG42 machine gun. The Sd.Kfz 234 series were primarily built as a further improvement to Germany's reconnaissance vehicles after learning of the effectiveness of said type of vehicle with combat reports of the Sd.Kfz. series 231/232/233.
