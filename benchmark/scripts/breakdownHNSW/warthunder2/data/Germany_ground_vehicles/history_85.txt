History of Ostwind_II: 
The Ostwind II was a development of the Ostwind. First conceived as early as October 1943, the Ostwind II saw the single 3.7 cm FlaK 43 replaced by a twinned 3.7 cm FlaK Zwilling 44 built by the Gustloff-Werke in Suhl. One single prototype was delivered to the Panzerflak-Ersatz und Ausbildungsabteilung Ohrsdurf/Th√ºhringen in January of 1945 for evaluation purposes, but due to the rapid events of the war it was never taken into production.
