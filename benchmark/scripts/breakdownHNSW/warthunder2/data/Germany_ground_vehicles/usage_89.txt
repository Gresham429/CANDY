Usage of JPz_4-5: 
The Jagdpanzer 4-5 is a very hard tank destroyer to master. It shines with excellent mobility and in rate of fire but has some serious downsides as well, such as the lack of a turret and really poor armour all around. The thin armour of this tank leaves little space for mistakes. Know the map and flank your enemies making use your excellent mobility, but don't get too carried away. Use your great mobility to get a great sniping spot early game, rather than just rushing into a capture point, because if you do, you're most likely going to be in a close-combat fight with another tank at the capture point, and the JPz 4-5 isn't great in close quarters combat. When you first spawn, drive and find a flanking position that allows you to quickly drive into cover with your fast reverse gear if you make a mistake. Scan the environment for enemies and take them out one by one, but don't get too carried away with it, once you kill 2 or 3 enemy tanks get out of that area and find a different spot, because most players will be looking for you when they respawn in another tank or aircraft. In case of getting spotted get in cover as fast as possible and reposition or wait until your enemy makes a mistake, like driving out into the open or getting bored and pushing or firing their cannon.
