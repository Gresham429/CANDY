Usage of Pz.III_J: 
Use of this tank is similar to the Pz.III F, and while it does have significantly better armour on the front than its predecessor, the higher BR means it faces nastier opposition. T-34 (1940)s are almost impenetrable from any side except flat-on below the tracks. M4A1s are similar in speed to you, have thinner sides, are spacious, have powerful guns, and stabilizers. Cromwells are much faster than you with stronger guns. You can only hope for them to get overconfident, overextend, and shoot them in the side or rear. APCR post-penetration damage is not reliable enough to be counted upon when you need it the most, and often can't frontally penetrate a Sherman or T-34 anyway.
