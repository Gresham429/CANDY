Usage of Pz.Kpfw._Churchill_(Germany): 
Like its British counterpart, the Churchill can be used as a very efficient brawler with its excellent turret traverse and gun depression, and heavy frontal armour. Though in urban environments, you should be careful in case someone tries to flank your weak side and rear armour.
