History of Ferdinand: 
During the program to create what will end up being the Tiger I tanks, Henschel and Porsche competed against each other for the contract to build the tanks. Porsche further developed their pre-existing 45-ton prototype, the VK 45.01 (P), while Henschel adapted their 36 ton prototype (VK 3601 H) to create the VK 4501 H. Henschel won the contract, but Porsche was extremely confident that their design would win that around 100 of the VK 4501 P chassis were already constructed. Since the design lost, it was determined to use the chassis for the basis of a new vehicle, namely a tank destroyer to mount the new and formidable 88 mm PaK 43 anti-tank gun. These new tank destroyers were then called the Ferdinand, after its designer Ferdinand Porsche.
