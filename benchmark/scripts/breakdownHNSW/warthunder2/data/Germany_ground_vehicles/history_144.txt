History of Leopard_2AV: 
The Leopard 2AV is a prototype tank design submitted to the US Army competition where it competed against the XM-1, predecessor of the Abrams MBT, at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The tank is a further development of the Leopard 2K project. American Army specialists involved in the project advised to increase the tank's protection, which by the beginning of the 70s was inadequate to meet modern challenges. In 1977, a version of the Leopard 2K with a modified hull and turret was submitted for testing in the United States under the designation Leopard 2AV. The prototype went overseas as two experimental chassis and three finished turrets. The tank was armed with the 105 mm L7A3 rifled gun, developed in Great Britain. After the tests ended, the tank was equipped with a 120-mm Rheinmetall gun, right there, at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It was this version that later went into series production under the designation Leopard 2.
