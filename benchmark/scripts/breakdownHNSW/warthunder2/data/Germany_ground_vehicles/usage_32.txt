Usage of Sd.Kfz.234/2: 
The Puma adopts a lot of typical light tank tactics. To play this vehicle well, you must shoot and scoot. Your fast reload times with a very fast reverse speed makes it ideal for firing around a corner, then backing up and flanking. The tank is very fast on the road; however, it has poor performance off-road, so it is not recommended on desert maps and muddy maps where you can get slowed down by the terrain. Since you have weak armour and a compact crew module, penetrative shots typically result in your destruction. It is advised to not brawl with tanks and to flank whenever possible, using your speed and mobility versus enemy tanks as your armour. Use the terrain to your advantage, firing over hills and making good use of your gun depression. Sidescrape corners and do not hold angles, as you will most likely be destroyed.
