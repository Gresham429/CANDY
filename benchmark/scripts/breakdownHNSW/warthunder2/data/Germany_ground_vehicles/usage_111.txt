Usage of RakJPz_2: 
The RakJPz 2 is an utility vehicle - that much should be made clear up front. It can be seen as being inferior to its cousin down the line, the RakJPz 2 (HOT), due to its lack of SACLOS ATGMs, and the inability to fire on the move and lack of armour can mean the vehicle ends up seeming like too much effort for too little gain. However, this is only the case with poor planning, as the RakJPz 2 shines in situations that involve either many ridgelines or long sightlines.
