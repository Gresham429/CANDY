Description of Nb.Fz.: 
The Panzerkampfwagen Neubaufahrzeug is a unique multi-turreted medium tank concept developed by Germany prior to World War II, which led to the introduction of a small series of experimental prototypes. These vehicles were designed in the early days of German tank development to deal with two key threats: enemy tanks and fortified positions. These two duties would eventually be performed by the Panzer III medium tank family and the Panzer IV medium tank family. The German Army believed that integrating these two concepts into a single vehicle would provide a far simpler solution, reduce construction time and increase production output. During the mid-1930s, a limited series of five experimental multi-turret tanks would be developed and tested for this purpose. This vehicle was given several distinct names during its brief service. In October 1933, WaPr√ºf 6 standardized the designation as Neubaufahrzeug (Eng. New Construction Vehicle or, abbreviated, Nb.Fz). The naming of "construction vehicle" for these tanks was an attempt to fool the Western countries and avoid the Treaty of Versailles' restrictions by claiming the vehicles were construction or utility vehicles.
