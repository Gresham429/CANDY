Usage of Jagdpanzer_38(t): 
The Jagdpanzer 38(t) tank destroyer is armed with a 75 mm PaK39 L48 cannon, making it quite capable of taking out enemy armour at its battle rating. Use its speed -- up to 42 km/h (26 mph) -- to take up sniping positions making full use of the frontal armour and height to achieve while the enemy deploy. Keep the distance while engaging, as this allows the Jagdpanzer 38(t) to get more mileage out of its thin but heavily sloped armour on the small size. Watch out for aircraft and artillery. To avoid being constantly targeted with artillery and bombardment, try to reposition after each enemy destroyed or a certain amount of time so as to disorientate the enemy. Be careful though in arcade battles you will be revealed so this will be much more challenging than in realistic battles.
