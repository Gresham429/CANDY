Usage of Panther_II: 
The Panther II is a medium tank that performs in many roles. With its powerful gun, it can very effectively take out opponents at its battle rating at both close and long ranges. The turret traverse is slow, which makes close-quarters engagements and urban combat difficult. But, this can be made up for by careful positioning and the use of the tank's neutral steering. The gun has a fairly standard gun depression and a good reload. All in all, the Panther II's armament is decent.
