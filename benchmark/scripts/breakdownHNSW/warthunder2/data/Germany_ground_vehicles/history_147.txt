History of Leopard_2_PSO: 
The Leopard 2 PSO, with PSO standing for "Peace Support Operations", was KMW's proactive development of the Bundeswehr's requirements for a tank that needed to be adapted for urban warfare peacekeeping operations. As a result of this version, the Leopard 2 PSO features a compact Euro-Powerpack engine, and has been equipped with optional equipment, capable of being fitted for whatever mission is at hand. The Leopard 2 PSO's hull has been equipped with additional armor modules on the sides and on the turret, as well as reinforced underbody protection. The modernization of Leopard 2 tanks under the PSO program was first delayed and then eventually abandoned in favor of upgrading tanks to the Leopard 2A7 specification.
