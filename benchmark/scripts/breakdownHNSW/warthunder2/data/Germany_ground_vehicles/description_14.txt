Description of Flakpanzer_I: 
The 2 cm Flak 38 auf Panzer I Ausf√ºhrung A (Flakpanzer I) is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun built by Germany during World War II on existing Panzer I light tank chassis. During the Battle of France, it was recognized that motorized anti-air units were insufficiently armoured. The German Heereswaffenamt decided to combine light anti-aircraft cannons with a light tank chassis. Since the Panzer I light tank chassis was readily available, it was used for these conversions. Stoewer was in charge of the conversions. There was a total of 24 of these vehicles built.
