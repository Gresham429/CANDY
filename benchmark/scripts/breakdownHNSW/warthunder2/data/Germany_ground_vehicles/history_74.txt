History of KV-IB_(Germany): 
The development of the KV-1 heavy tank began after the numerous flaws of the T-35 multi-turreted tank came to light. Designers were ordered to draw up new designs to become the basis of a breakthrough heavy tank as deemed necessary by Soviet combat doctrine. This called for a tank that was heavily armoured, but not very mobile as it was to be for siege warfare. The designs offered all had heavy armour, and wide tracks, and used the torsion-bar suspension. The designs were the SMK, T-100, and what would become the KV tank, which was named after the then Soviet Defense Commissar Kliment Voroshilov.
