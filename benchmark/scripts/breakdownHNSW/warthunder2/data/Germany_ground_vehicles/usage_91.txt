Usage of Jagdtiger: 
Inherent as any other tank destroyer: limit the avenues of approach for your enemies with either obstacles or distance and try to pick off targets one-on-one and not several at the same time. Despite its heavy armour, the Jagdtiger should retreat after every shot, if the opposition possesses weapons with penetration defeating 180 mm of armour, or else the lower plate will provide a big target. Make sure to take each corner with plenty of momentum though, if an enemy destroys the tracks or transmission during a turn, the remaining momentum will carry the Jagdtiger into a firing position or to safety.
