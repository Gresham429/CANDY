History of Bfw._Jagdpanther_G1: 
The formidable 8.8 cm Pak43 anti-tank gun was created as a longer version of the 8.8 cm KwK36. Two attempts were made to fit this gun onto a self-propelled chassis, the first was thePanzerjäger Tiger (P) Ferdinand (later Elefant) and the second was the Nashorn. However, the Ferdinand was too heavy and unreliable while the Nashorn chassis was too small and underpowered to propel such a gun. The Jagdpanther was proposed in late 1942, as a tank destroyer mounting the formidable 8.8 cm Pak43, built on the Panther chassis with good armour and speed. The tank destroyer was created and designated SdKfz 173 and was demonstrated to Hitler on October 1943. Production then started in January 1944 under the simpler name Jagdpanther, which Hitler preferred over the longer 8.8 cm Pak43/3 auf Panzerjäger Panther.
