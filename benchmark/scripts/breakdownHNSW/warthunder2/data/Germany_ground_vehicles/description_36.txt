Description of Pz.III_M: 
The Panzerkampfwagen III Ausführung M (Panzer III M) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 141/1) is the eleventh variant of the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank family (the "I" variant was skipped). In February 1942, orders for the Panzer III M were placed. They shared the same characteristics as the Panzer III L but were outfitted with deep-wading equipment. It was mounted with the same long-barrelled 50 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 39 L/60 tank gun. While the greater length of the barrel increased the 50 mm KwK 39 L/60 tank gun's velocity and penetration power over the previous 50 mm KwK38 L/42 tank gun, the introduction of the Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV-1 heavy tanks quickly rendered it obsolete. With the arrival of the long-barrelled 75 mm KwK40 L/43 tank gun in the Panzer IV F2, the German Wehrmacht eventually decided to discontinue all future Panzer III manufacturing and redirect all resources to the development of more Panzer IVs. Beginning in May 1943, 5 mm side skirt armour panels known as Schürzen were installed on the hull side to prevent the Soviet 14.5 mm anti-tank rifle from penetrating the Panzer III's side armour. More plates were added to completely surround the turret, leaving only the front open for the main gun. Since the Panzer III M fought in the North African Campaign during fierce engagements with British forces, it has been painted in the distinctive Dunkelgelb yellow coat.
