Usage of Waffentrager: 
Despite its fully-traversable turret, the Waffenträger is a classic tank destroyer. It has a potent gun, which can defeat almost any heavy tank at this tier, even at long ranges. The shells have great penetration, great explosive filler, and above-average velocity for the tier. The vehicle even has a better-than-average reload speed. (Note: keep in mind that the Waffenträger is not equipped with any machine guns.)
