Usage of Sd.Kfz.251/21: 
Because the Sd.Kfz.251/21 lacks any sort of effective armour, it is highly recommended that you stay behind at spawn point, keeping an eye out for aircraft. It is ill-advised to try to engage ground vehicles as long as you haven't researched the H-Pzgr modification. This belt can penetrate 51 mm of armour at 10 m, so it is better to flank and shoot for lower side armour if possible. Beware of heavy tanks such as the KV-1: their minimum armour thickness is 75 mm, so that renders this heavy tank immune to your shots. Avoid if at all possible, but if you can't avoid, damage the cannon barrel and the tracks to give you time to escape.
