Usage of StuG_III_F: 
StuGs, with their thin side and top armour, should be careful of their position. If operating alone, StuGs should either move to the flanks in order to catch the enemy unaware, or operate behind friendly lines. Staying behind cover is preferable, although many rock formations will block the gun trajectory (whilst other tanks can simply shoot over them). Do always keep at least one flank covered, if the enemy is within range.
