Usage of E-100: 
The E-100 is played similar to the Maus, with the same armaments and similar armour rating. However, the E-100 has the benefit of increased mobility due to its improved chassis. The E-100 can thus be somewhat more suitable in moving from cover, but close quarter combat is still not recommended due to its still relatively slow movement, long reloads, and the lethal anti-tank armaments the other Rank V vehicles are bound to have, including the now prominent Anti-tank guided missiles. In a down-tier, the E-100 can be played much more aggressively and has to put pressure on the enemy team in order to be impactful. The psychological factor makes it easier to achieve this goal as this tank is a very feared foe and can, in fact, turn the tide of the game. However, down-tiers should be taken seriously as your enemies will be focused on taking you out. Picking the right targets is also something that an E-100 driver has to master to get good games. When facing light and an armoured target the main gun should always be used to destroy the strongest tank while the 75 mm gun takes care of the squishy one. Even when facing weaker opponents the turret has to be angled between each shot in order to avoid shot traps. When the E-100 gets an up-tier you should get to cover as quickly as you can and play it extremely carefully as any shell may be enough to take you out or at least cripple you. The 128 mm is not as effective as you now have to aim for weak spots on tanks like the T-55AM-1 and the 75 mm should become a smoke dispenser.
