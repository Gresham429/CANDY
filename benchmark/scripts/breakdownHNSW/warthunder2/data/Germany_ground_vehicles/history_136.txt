History of Leopard_2A4: 
Based on the testing results gathered from the various different Leopard 2K prototypes, a new Leopard 2 prototype was constructed that would be more representative of the final version of the vehicle. Designated as Leopard 2AV, the new prototype featured a redesigned hull and turret over the Leopard 2K. Furthermore, the prototype was tested with two different cannons; the  British rifled 105 mm L7 and the German 120 mm Rheinmetall L44 smoothbore cannon.
