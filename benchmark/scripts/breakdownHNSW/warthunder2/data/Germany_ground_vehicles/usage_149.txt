Usage of FlaRakRad: 
It is recommended to change the radar range from 10 to 20 km, find a concealed spot near spawn and memorize where the helicopters' airfield is. Helicopters are easy prey for the FlaRakRad; but be careful to take them out quickly or you'll find you have a 9M127 Vikhr headed right at you. Be careful to not radar lock helicopters, as they usually have RWR and will detect you if you lock them. Try instead to hand guide the missiles. This isn't as hard as it seems, as helicopters mostly hover and without the RWR won't know where the missile is coming from. Once the VT1 missile is unlocked, this allows the FlaRakRad to be able to finally engage aircraft with any hint of reliability. Still, one must exercise discipline when choosing when to engage aircraft, as the VT1 can still be dodged. As for the VT1 against helicopters, it just allows the FlaRakRad to kill enemy helicopters quicker, giving them less time to react. All in all, the FlaRakRad is a competent SPAA once one unlocks the missile and has the flexibility to engage aircraft as well as helis. Keep in mind that after firing the second missile, the FlaRakRad will not begin reloading until the second missile hits a target or reaches its max range and self-destructs. This means if you miss the second missile, you are vulnerable to air attack while waiting to reload. Take care not to be hit, and you'll have a good time.
