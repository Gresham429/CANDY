History of Jagdpanther_G1: 
Nazi Germany created the formidable 8.8 cm Pak43 anti-tank gun, a longer version of the 8.8 cm KwK36. 2 attempts were made to fit this gun onto a self-propelled configuration, the first was Panzerjäger Tiger (P) Ferdinand (later Elefant) and the second was the Nashorn. However, the Ferdinand was too heavy and unreliable while the Nashorn was too small and underpowered to propel such a gun. The Jagdpanther was proposed in late 1942, as a tank destroyer from the Panther chassis that could mount the formidable 8.8 cm Pak43 with good armour and speed. The tank destroyer was created and designated Sd.Kfz. 173 and was demonstrated to Hitler on October 1943. Production then started in January 1944 under the simpler name Jagdpanther by Hitler rather than using the longer 8.8 cm Pak43/3 auf Panzerjäger Panther.
