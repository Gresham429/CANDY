Description of Marder_III: 
The Marder III (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 139) was a modified Pz.38(t) up-gunned with captured Russian 76.2 mm field guns rechambered with the munition of the PaK 40 as a self-propelled anti-tank gun, adding significant firepower among self-propelled battalions. It was primarily decided to be built due to the increase of heavier Russian targets such as the KV-1 and T-34 as the German anti-tank tools in early Barbarossa failed to deal with these targets.
