Usage of Leopard_2A5: 
In War Thunder, the Leopard 2A5 is a top-class tank with advanced technologies to enable players to compete against opponent in a tactical and strategic field. The Leopard 2A5 is best used in ambush or other surprise attack methods due to its superb mobility, which can help position the lethal firepower and precision the Leopard 2A5's 120 mm cannon can bring. Finding a good position can also enable a hull-down position to show only the turret and gun, leveraging the robust armour and natural cover to minimize the return fire while being able to dish out 120 mm projectiles undeterred. The tank is also great at moving around the battlefield to attack the enemies from their more vulnerable sides or rear, where they are not as strong. With the right aggressiveness, the Leopard 2A5 can whittle away or even dismantle the enemy team's initiative and lead their team to victory.
