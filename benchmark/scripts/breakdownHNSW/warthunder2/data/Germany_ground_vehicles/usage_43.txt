Usage of StuH_42_G: 
The StuH 42 G boasts a front armour which, if used correctly, can become impenetrable to most enemies it encounters at its battle rating. With the Add-on armour modification, the StuH's armour is brought up to a minimum of ~40 mm and maximum of ~90 mm RHA with quite good angles, when this armour is supplemented with medium range or slight angling, only SPG and several medium tanks will manage to crack through its defences without using HE. The Sturmhaubitze 42 performs best in urban or spaced hills environment, where the poor gun depression and low shell velocity won't matter as much and it can just terminate any tank trying to get past or attempting to fight it.
