Usage of KPz-70: 
The tank plays very much like the Leopard A1A1. Players familiar with the Leopard playstyle will easily adapt to the KPz-70. It has reasonable mobility, especially with full upgrades and aced crew, allowing it to manoeuvre into spots not typically accessible by less mobile tanks. Utilize this to an advantage to set up ambushes as this is how the KPz-70 will get the best of many opponents. It's important to recognize when engagement is not beneficial so that the tank may get a better position or escape from the threat.
