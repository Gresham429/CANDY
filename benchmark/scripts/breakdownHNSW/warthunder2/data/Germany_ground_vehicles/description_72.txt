Description of Sd.Kfz.234/4: 
The s.Pz.Sp.Wg. (7,5 cm) Sd.Kfz.234/4 (full name: Schwerer Panzersp√§hwagen 7.5 cm Sonderkraftfahrzeug 234/4 Panzerabwehrkanonenwagen) was a relatively improvised variant on the Sd.Kfz.234 chassis, created in late 1944 to prevent PaK40s from falling behind during the constant retreat of the Germans on all fronts. By removing the superstructure of the Sd.Kfz.234 and installing a PaK 40 mount with a small cut in the bottom half of the shield, the gun could roll into position, take shots, and drive at full speed in reverse.
