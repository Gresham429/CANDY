Description of StuG_III_F: 
The Sturmgeschütz III Ausführung F (StuG III F) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 142/1) is the early version of the sixth variant of the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun family. The German Army was in disarray as it faced an increasing number of well-armed and protected Soviet tanks. In 1941, German tanks and anti-tank guns were barely able to defend against enemy tanks. Due to a shortage of manufacturing capacity, the Germans had only two alternatives for a speedy response: create temporary anti-tank vehicles or upgrade the firepower of existing designs. Following the second option, future StuG III assault guns would be deployed for anti-armour roles, an entirely different task that they were not originally planned for. Its short-barrelled 75 mm Sturmkanone (StuK) 37 L/24 tank gun would be replaced with a long-barrelled 75 mm StuK40 L/43 tank gun, increasing its overall firepower significantly. This led to the development of the StuG III F variant, an extremely lethal vehicle due to its low cost, compact silhouette, fully protected superstructure, and powerful gun.
