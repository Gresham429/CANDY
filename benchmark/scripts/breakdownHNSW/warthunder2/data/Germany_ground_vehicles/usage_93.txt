Usage of Bfw._Jagdpanther_G1: 
The Jagdpanther is best used defensively, to cover capture points and prevent their capture, and to cover friendly tank advances. It's highly recommended to hide the lower frontal plate in this tank, as it has a frontal mounted transmission which will set on fire if shot. It is also strongly advised to use this tank to engage at long range, and to change position often.
