Usage of Wiesel_1A2: 
The primary use of the Wiesel 1A2 should be as an ambush tank destroyer. Utilizing the ATGM's impressive depression angle of -20Â° to conceal the Wiesel on the tops of hills and in ditches allow the player to be all but invisible to enemy armour. In environments that lack such features such as cities, the Wiesel is able to best fulfill its role by hiding in corners and dead ends angles so that an enemy approaching the Wiesel will not be able to react in time. Due to the long reload of the ATGM paired with the paper-thin armour, it is not recommended to brawl with this tankette. However, if the Wiesel has the element of surprise, the punchy TOW-2A can deliver a killing blow in a single hit. Another aspect to note is the insanely good power-to-weight ratio, allowing Wiesel to climb steep inclines and to access locations not often accessible to most tanks. Use this mobility to place the Wiesel in a spot where enemy tanks will not be expecting it.
