Description of Tiger_II_(10.5_cm_Kw.K): 
The Pz.Kpfw. VI Ausf. B mit 10.5cm KwK L/68 (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 182) is a rank IV German heavy tank 
with a battle rating of 7.0 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced to the main tree during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before Update 1.41 as a main tree vehicle, however, as of Update 1.91 "Night Vision" it was shifted to become a gift vehicle for players who previously owned it. Increasing Tiger II's main cannon to a whopping 10.5 cm cannon, the Tiger II (10.5 cm Kw.K) boasts a much more powerful armament than any of the preceding German heavy tanks.
