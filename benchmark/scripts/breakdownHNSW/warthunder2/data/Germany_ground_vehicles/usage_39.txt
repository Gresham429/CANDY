Usage of Pz.IV_H: 
This tank can be described in one word: capable. While this version of the Panzer IV isn't nearly as renowned and feared as the Ausf. F2 or Ausf. G variants, it is still a very capable medium tank. The Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H has a new gun that, while not that different to the guns on the F2 and G, still packs a deadly punch at its BR. The armour is meh, with a paltry 50 mm of armour at the front of the turret, and 80 mm of armour at the front of the hull. This makes you an easy target for tanks like KV-2s, T-34-85 (D-5T)s, and M4A3E2 Jumbos among others. But, with some careful play and some creative use of angling, you can bounce some shots from equal rank tanks, and destroy tanks at the top of your BR range. Mobility of this tank is lacking, albeit not by much. (It is the heaviest version of the entire Panzer 4 series after all). It's acceptable, but it will still take time for it to accelerate to its top speed, as your engine is underpowered and your tracks are narrow, which results in poorer cross-country performance than comparable tanks.
