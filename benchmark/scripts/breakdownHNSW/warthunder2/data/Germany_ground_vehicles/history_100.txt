History of Flakpanzer_341: 
The 3,7 cm Flakzwilling auf Panther Fahrgestell, Flakpanzer 341, also known as the Flakpanzer V Coelian, was a concept for a Flakpanzer first proposed in early 1944. Reacting to the increased threat posed by fighter-bombers and low altitude attackers, a proposal was made for a Flakpanzer based on the hull of a Panzer V Panther. This would have a fully enclosed turret to protect the crews from enemy fire, unlike the turrets of vehicles that were already in use such as the Flakpanzer 38 or the Flakpanzer IV MÃ¶belwagen. In response to this tender, Rheinmetall developed the "Coelian", originally envisaging a number of the turret and armament variants such as the 2cm Flak-Vierling 151 armed with four 20 mm MG 151/20 guns. However, the German Army High Command's requirements kept on changing, demanding for ever-heavier armaments and armour, and eventually, two different designs were settled upon in May of 1944, one armed with a twinned 3.7 cm Flakzwilling 44, and one with a newly designed 5.5 cm Flak gun.
