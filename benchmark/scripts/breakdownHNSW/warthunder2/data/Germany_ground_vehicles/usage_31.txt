Usage of Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f)_KwK: 
With a lack of a coaxial machine gun and poor armor, players may find head on attacks against enemies difficult. Instead utilization of their speed and powerful cannon will be their main objective. Flank attacks and supporting fire for teammates are highly recommended. The high agility of the vehicle also allows for the capture of objectives quickly and efficiently while being able to avoid enemies. However a lack of ammunition does force the player to select their shots carefully as one too many missed or wasted shots can result in a quick return to the hanger. With the lack of a roof and armor in the rear it's highly recommended to always be facing the enemy. Despite being weak, the armor of the turret prevents mostly machine gun fire from harming the loader and gunner. The protection of these two members can be the factor between losing the vehicle or being able to limp back to a control point.
