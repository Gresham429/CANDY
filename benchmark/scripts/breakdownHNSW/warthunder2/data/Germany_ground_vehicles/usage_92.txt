Usage of Pz.Bef.Wg.VI_P: 
With this tank, a calm and patient player will be able to rip apart lots of enemies, before being knocked out. The Tiger I P can easily survive a duel with other Henschel Tigers, because its hull armour is much stronger, and they use the same turret, that is rather hard to be penetrated by Short 8.8cm guns they use.
