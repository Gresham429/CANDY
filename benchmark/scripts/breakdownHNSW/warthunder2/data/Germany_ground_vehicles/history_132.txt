History of Radkampfwagen_90: 
In the early 1980s, the German Federal Ministry of Defence, known as the Bundesministerium der Verteidigung (BMVg) in German, initiated a program to produce an eight-wheeled combat vehicle. The reason for the program's creation was the success of the Spähpanzer 2 Luchs and the Transportpanzer Fuchs, along with vehicles operated by other countries, such as the French AMX-10RC. Daimler-Benz was tasked with the construction of such a vehicle, and the requirements were for an 8 x 8 wheeled combat vehicle with a weight of less than 30 tons and a powerful armament and adequate armour. The first prototype was built in 1983, and was first known as the Demonstrationsfahrzeug Rad (demonstration vehicle wheeled) and then the Experimentalfahrzeug Rad (8×8), meaning experimental vehicle wheeled (8×8). It finally received the name Radpanzer 90, and it is known as the Radkampfwagen 90 in War Thunder. The final production model was completed in 1986. It featured a rear-mounted engine, had an independent suspension for the wheels, and the turret was that of the Leopard 1A3. The Radpanzer 90 never entered service, but the information gathered from the program was later used in the development of the GTK Boxer wheeled vehicle.
