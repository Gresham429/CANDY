Usage of Tiger_II_(H): 
The Tiger II (H) is best used at mid to long ranges, where its small weak spots are hardest to hit. It can, however, be put to work on the front lines, protecting medium tanks and tank destroyers - just be aware of your limited mobility, and ensure you have options should you get advanced upon by multiple enemies.
