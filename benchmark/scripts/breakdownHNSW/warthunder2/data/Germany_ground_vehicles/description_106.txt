Description of DF105: 
The DF105 was a support/light tank developed between France and Germany during the 1980s by the company Thyssen Henschel. The DF105 was intended to be used only as an export vehicle and not for domestical purposes. The DF105 introduced the same gun and turret as the Austrian SK-105, and had an overall very similar design. It's design and components were also based in the French AMX-13 and German TAM, developed for Argentina. The gun was the new CN105-57 (105 mm) only found on modernized AMX-13 tanks and the already mentioned SK-105. This tank had an autoloader making good use of it's oscillating turret. The vehicle also used the same hull as the Marder I IFV and a relatively powerful powerplant. However at the end the vehicle did not evolve and stayed as a prototype due to a lack of foreign buyers.
