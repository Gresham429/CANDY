Usage of FlaRakPz_1: 
The FlaRakPz 1 does not have any additional armaments to attack other vehicles or protect itself, limiting its offensive ability towards even slightly-armoured targets. Due to this, moving any distance from the spawn point will result in death due to the thin armour and increased visibility, due to vehicle markers, making the FlaRakPz 1 an easy target. Both the Roland 2 and Roland 3 SAMs have a maximum speed of 900 m/s, with payloads of 3.3 kg and 4.45 kg of Composition B respectably, more than enough to deal with the only aircraft type (helicopters) it will encounter in this game mode. Moving alongside allies or waiting in or near spawn areas - where the FlaRakPz 1 has the best view of the sky - will be rewarding as when engaging medium to heavily armoured units, the explosive mass of the missiles will be most useful in destroying or disabling targets, requiring knowledge of vulnerable spots on enemy vehicles to deliver a finishing blow. Due to the large explosive mass of both missiles, it can destroy light targets with overpressure.
