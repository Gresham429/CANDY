History of VT1-2: 
The project for an experimental turretless tank was started for development in Germany in the early 70's as part of the replacement program for the Leopard 1. The unusual layout of the "casemate" tank type had several advantages: the possibility of installing two cannons at once, increased protection due to low silhouette and enhanced protection in the hull front profile and also increased mobility due to a reduced weight compared to traditional tanks. As part of this innovative project, two vehicles were built under the general name of Versuchstr√§ger (German: experimental platform). The first VT1-1 prototype was placed on a shortened chassis and was equipped with two 105mm rifled cannons with manual loading.
