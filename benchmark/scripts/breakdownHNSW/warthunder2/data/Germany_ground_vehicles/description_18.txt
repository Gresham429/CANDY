Description of 15cm_sIG_33_B_Sfl: 
The 15 cm sIG 33 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sf), also known as the Sturmpanzer II Bison during World War II, is a German assault gun built primarily for infantry support and anti-fortification roles. Several prototypes were built, with the final one based on a standard Panzer II Ausf. B chassis. The chassis was extended by 60 cm, necessitating the addition of a sixth roadwheel, and widened by 32 cm to better fit the cannon while maintaining its low silhouette. A total of twelve units were built between December 1941 and January 1942. They were deployed to North Africa, where they formed schwere Infanteriegesch√ºtz-Kompanien (mot.S.) 707 and 708 as close support mobile artillery. Both companies fought in Tunisia until the Axis surrendered in May 1943.
