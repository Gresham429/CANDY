Usage of Sd.Kfz._6/2: 
To use this machine to its fullest capabilities, stay away from areas of heavy combat, as you can be taken out very easily, especially by machine gun fire and HE shells. You should always stay behind friendly troops, but don't stay at spawn as it is most likely the first place enemy planes will go to drop bombs.
