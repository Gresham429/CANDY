Usage of Flakpanzer_38: 
At the start of the match, you can camp around the spawn point and wait until the enemy planes show up, this is the safest way, but it's passive and not efficient in terms of getting kills. So if you are brave / skilled enough, use it as a light tank as it has 42 km/h top speed. The 20 mm cannon is very deadly against any light and fast vehicles, it can finish up their crew easily when penetrated. However you must be very careful as the Flakpanzer 38 only has 2 crew, and losing one means death. Unfortunately, the gunner is the most exposed and unprotected crew and is extremely vulnerable to everything: artillery, MG fire, planes, small bombs, rockets, etc. Do whatever you can to stay alive, as this vehicle has more potential as the match progresses. Pick on those soft targets and avoid heavily armoured ones to ensure effective penetration and killing.
