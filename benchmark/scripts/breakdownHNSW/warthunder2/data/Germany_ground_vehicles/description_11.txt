Description of Pz.II_F: 
The Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf√ºhrung F (Panzer II F) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 121) is the sixth variant of the Panzer II light tank family. The Panzer II F variant was designed with thicker 30 mm armour on the tank hull's front and 30 mm armour on the turret's front. Instead of a split hatch, the commander cupola is fitted with a periscope on top of the turret. The side vision ports were protected by vertical bullet splash shields and two conical bolts above and below the visor to hold the 50 mm bulletproof glass in position. A triangle-shaped guard welded to the top of the superstructure at the front and back shielded the turret ring from small bullets and shrapnel. To the right of the driver's vision port, a fake armoured visor constructed of aluminium alloy was mounted onto the front of the hull. This was done in order to draw hostile fire away from the driver. The majority of the other components needed to construct the tank were carried over from earlier variants. It was armed with an improved Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 38 20 mm L/55 autocannon and a 7.92 mm MG34 machine gun. In March 1941, the first seven Panzer II F light tanks were completed. Production ceased in late July 1942. A total of 1,004 were assigned chassis numbers and went into service. They were mostly utilized as reconnaissance tanks on the Eastern Front, but some Panzer II F light tanks were transferred to Libya as replacements.
