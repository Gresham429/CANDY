Usage of Panther_D: 
The Panther has a much stronger front glacis armour than its heavy tank companion Tiger I, with ~140 mm effective thickness with sloping compared to the Tiger's 100 mm armour. However, only the frontal glacis is nigh impenetrable, the side armour and turret are very vulnerable and care must be taken to keep this safe.
