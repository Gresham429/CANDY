Usage of Sd.Kfz.222: 
The Sdkfz.222, (known as Leichter Panzersp√§hwagen, which means a 'light armored recon. vehicle) is a fast vehicle, which is easily able to reach 50 km/h in no time. The vehicle can sneak behind enemy lines and mark targets for other heavier vehicles to attack. Utilizing its speed, it can set up ambushes at enemy vehicles, when the enemy is not actively observing the area. the 20 mm fast-firing autocannon with AP belts paired with speed can easily disrupt enemy vehicles, slowing them down. This can also be used as a distraction while friendly units are capturing points, at the same time using its mobility to escape enemy rounds. Because of the high elevation angles, it can knock out air targets with either Sprger. or the default ammunition (API-T, HEFI-T) (note that Sprger rounds only contain HEFI-T rounds).
