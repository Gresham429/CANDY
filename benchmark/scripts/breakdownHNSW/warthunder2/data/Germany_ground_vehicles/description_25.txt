Description of Pz.II_C_(DAK): 
The Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf√ºhrung C Deutsches Afrikakorps (Panzer II C DAK) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 121) is a third variant of the Panzer II light tank family that was used by the Afrika Korps, a German expeditionary force in Africa during World War II's North African campaign. Initially sent as a defensive force to help Italy defend its African colonies, the formation fought in Africa under several names from March 1941 until its surrender in May 1943. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was the unit's most well-known commander. On 11 January 1941, the Afrika Korps was founded, and on 11 February, one of Adolf Hitler's favourite generals, Erwin Rommel, was appointed commander. Originally, Hans von Funck was supposed to lead it, but Hitler despised von Funck since he had been Werner von Fritsch's personal staff officer until von Fritsch was fired in 1938. Except for minor differences, the Panzer II C (DAK) is fairly similar to the standard Panzer II C variant. The Panzer II C (DAK) primarily operated in the desert with the 2nd Battalion, 5th Panzer Regiment, 21st Division. The cooling air intake and exhaust apertures were expanded in these tanks, and the radiator fan was replaced with a high-performance version to cope with the intense desert temperatures. In 1942, four poles were installed around the turret cupola to serve as a base for a Fla-MG anti-aircraft machine gun.
