Usage of Pz.II_C_(DAK): 
The main key to success with this vehicle is to drive aggressively, trying to get shots at relatively close range (100-300 m or even less). Aiming for the enemy's weak spots, it is often possible to set your opponent on fire, allowing the Pz.II to take on vehicles beyond its battle rating.
