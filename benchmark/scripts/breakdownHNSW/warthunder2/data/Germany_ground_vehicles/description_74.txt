Description of KV-IB_(Germany): 
The â–€KV-IB is one of the two Finnish captured KV-1 tanks from the Soviet Union during the Finnish-Soviet conflicts. This KV-1E (model 1940) that the Finns seized near Solomennoye, Petrozavodsk at the beginning of the Continuation War. Following the German designation of KV-1B, the Finns gave it the index number Ps. 272-1 and the nickname "Klimi". The Finns put it into service in early 1942. It was one of the few modern tanks that the Finns had at that time, but it had many problems. The tank crew had poor visibility, and the tank had many technical issues that made it unreliable. The Finns also lacked spare parts, so maintenance often stretched long times. The tank saw little action in the Lapland War, after which it transferred to the Training Battalion of the Tank Brigade on October 31, 1944. The Finns did not use it much after the war, even though they kept it until 1955. Both KV-1 tanks that the Finns captured are still in the Parola Tank Museum today.
