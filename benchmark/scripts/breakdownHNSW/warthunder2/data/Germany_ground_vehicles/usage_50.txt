Usage of Pz.Sfl.Ic: 
In battles, it performs well as a scout vehicle with its high mobility in all game modes. It can also function well as a tank destroyer with its high penetration power. It has very little gun depression, which means you won't be able to reliably shoot over hills. It also lacks a machine gun to combat planes and open-topped vehicles, which can be a burden.
