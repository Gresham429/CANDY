Usage of VFW: 
Because of its great cannon and non-existent armour, the VFW is best used as a glass cannon for long range engagements. Find a spot on a hill or slope and wait for targets. If use in urban area is unavoidable, choose the "side skirts down" mode. This makes the cannon more flexible and gives you a quicker reload time. Make sure to stay in cover, since with your side skirts down, you will be an easy target for planes and artillery.
