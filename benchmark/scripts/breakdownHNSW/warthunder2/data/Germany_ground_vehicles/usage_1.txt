Usage of Pz.35(t): 
The tank is average in most aspects, aside from frontal immunity to .50 cals. Since your common enemies (eg. BT-5s) are faster than you, it is advisable to use this tank as a mid-range support vehicle. At the start of the match, avoid getting surrounded by enemies by not rushing to the frontline straight away, because its hull and turret traverse are all quite bad, making it vulnerable to surprise flanks. Find hilly terrain and utilise your 10 degrees gun depression to poke out, get a shot, then get back into cover before the enemies notice you.
