Description of Panther_F: 
The Panzerkampfwagen V Ausführung F (Panther F) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 171) is the fourth production variant of the iconic Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank family. In November 1943, Rheinmetall designed a new turret with a narrow front plate 120 mm (4.72 in) thick. From a distance, the narrow turret presented a smaller target for the enemy. In March 1944, the design was revised under the name Schmale Blende Turm-Panther. This was one of several designs that were eventually dubbed "Schmallturm" (narrow turret). The Schmale Blende appears to be a modification that served as one of numerous proposals for the Panzerkampfwagen V Ausfuehrung II (Panther II). This updated turret design weighed less than the original Panther turret (from 7,665 kg to 7,565 kg) and reduced the area of frontal armour while maintaining interior crew space. It also reduced production time by around 30-40%. Unfortunately, due to the end of World War II, the Panther F did not see serial production, but eight hulls and three turrets were completed in 1945.
