Description of Kugelblitz: 
The Flakpanzer IV "Kugelblitz" is the third variant of the Flakpanzer IV self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. The Panzer IV medium tank chassis is combined with a newly designed oscillating turret to provide complete protection for the crews. This turret was completely enclosed, with overhead protection and full traverse. The disruption caused by Allied bombing efforts prevented mass production from taking place.
