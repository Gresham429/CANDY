Description of Pz.III_L: 
The Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf√ºhrung L (Panzer III L) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 141/1) is the tenth variant of the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank family (the "I" variant was skipped). It is essentially a newly manufactured Panzer III based on Panzer III J1 standards, which was modified from existing Panzer III Js. Both the turret and the frontal hull were outfitted with spaced armour. It was also outfitted with a new system for transferring heated engine coolant to another vehicle. However, distinguishing the different variations based on the look of spaced armour on Panzer IIIs is not a viable method. The front of the turret and the hull of the latest production Panzer IV J tanks were fitted with 20 mm spaced armour plates. Some older Panzer III variants also had it fitted in the field.
