Description of Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f)_KwK: 
The capitulation of France in 1940 saw a number of equipment captured by the Germans, including the AMD.35 armoured car and their production facilities. The German Wehrmacht pressed the Panhard armoured car into service, issuing them to their reconnaissance units and they would see prominent use during Operation Barbarossa. However, as the years pass, the AMD.35 were seen as becoming obsolete in the frontline services and saw more use behind the lines such as occupational and policing duties. In 1944, it was decided to take 34 AMD.35 and modify them to accommodate the 50 mm L/42 tank gun used in the Panzer III. Transformed into open-top vehicles and designated as Pz.Sp.Wg.P204(f) KwK, the were utilized in occupation duties until the Allied invasion of Normandy, where the vehicles were then committed to combat the invading Allies.
