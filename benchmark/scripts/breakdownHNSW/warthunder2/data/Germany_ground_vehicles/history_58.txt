History of VK_3002_(M): 
The VK 3002 (M) was MAN's attempt at designing a breakthrough medium tank, which was needed at the time due to the Pz. III and IV's inability to effectively combat the T-34. On May 13th, 1942, the tank's design, alongside with Daimler-Benz's version, were submitted to the Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Despite the Daimler-Benz prototype's lower cost, the MAN design was chosen due to the more spacious turret and more modern suspension. Furthermore, the MAN variant used the same engine as the Tiger H1, which helped with production and maintenance. The newly chosen design was slightly modified, and then entered production under the official designation - Pz. Kpfw. V Panther D.
