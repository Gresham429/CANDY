Usage of Panther_F: 
The Panther is a great "hunter," locating weak (slow, damaged, or alone) tanks and taking them out is by far its greatest capability. Mobility is a big advantage and the tanker should use it to their advantage, especially when fighting higher-rank vehicles. You should find a suitable location as soon as possible; when you do this, you can easily push off advancing enemy tanks while heavier allies join the action. Just when you notice that you have strong opposition it is time to retreat. Your role is not to fight directly but rather spot weaknesses in the enemy defence. Once you learn how to take advantage of its speed and gun, you'll easily take out enemy targets by surprise.
