Description of RakJPz_2: 
The RakJPz 2 was a vehicle born out of what would become Germany's last casemate tank destroyer - the Kanonenjagdpanzer program. Development of what would become the RakJPz 1 was done mostly in parallel to the main Kanonenjagdpanzer program starting in 1959, and 4 successive variants of Raketenjagdpanzers would serve with the Bundeswehr up to the year 2005 when the final RaketenJagdpanzer 3/4s (then called the Jaguar 1A3) were retired from service. The RaketenJagdpanzer 2 (RakJPz 2) is the second development of this lineage of tank destroyers, switching from the HS.30 hull to the Kanonenjagdpanzer hull, and sporting an armament of two SS.11 launchers on the top of the hull. The RakJPz 2 was superseded by later developments which removed the MCLOS-guided SS.11 missiles in favour of the more advanced SACLOS-guiding HOT ATGMs, redesignating the vehicle as the RakJPz 3/Jaguar 1.
