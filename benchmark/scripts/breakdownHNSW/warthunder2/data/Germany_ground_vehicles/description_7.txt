Description of Pz.III_F: 
The Panzerkampfwagen III Ausführung F (Panzer III F) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 141) is the sixth variant of the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank family. The Panzer III F, which succeeded the Panzer III E as the next medium tank in the Panzer III medium tank family, was largely an improved variant with a few crucial upgrades and adjustments. Notably, in addition to the Panzer III E's new torsion bar suspension system, making it easier and cheaper to build and repair in combat, it also mounted a new 50 mm Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 38 L/42 tank gun which significantly increased its firepower. The Panzer III F saw a greater quantity of production than the Panzer III E, with over 400 units produced between 1939 and 1941. As a result, it was one of the most numerous Panzer IIIs, and it played an important part in the early phases of World War II, beginning with the invasion of the West in May 1940.
