History of Marder_III_H: 
After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht found itself in a very dire situation due to the lack of adequate mobile anti-tank weapons, especially after the appearance of the superior Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks. The only mass-issued dedicated anti-tank gun was the 37 mm PaK36 while the sole widely used tank destroyer was the Panzerj√§ger I with the Czech 47 mm anti-tank gun. Obsolete tanks and captured vehicles were converted to tank destroyers to enable them to penetrate the modern Soviet tanks at common combat distances. Those were mainly the Marder I (from French Lorraine tracked supply vehicles), the Marder II (from Panzer IIs), and the Marder III (from Czech Panzer 38(t)s).
