History of Nb.Fz.: 
The Neubaufahrzeug was a prototype of what was to come with German heavy tanks. Historically, they were slow, heavy, and complicated. Not thought of as successful, only 5 were actually built. 3 of these tanks were sent to Norway at the start of the war, but only 1 of the 3 saw action. They were mostly used for propaganda.
