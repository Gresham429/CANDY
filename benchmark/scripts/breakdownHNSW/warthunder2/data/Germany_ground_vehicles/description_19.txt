Description of Sd.Kfz.221_(s.Pz.B.41): 
The le.Pz.Sp.Wg. Sd.Kfz. 221 (Leichter Panzersp√§hwagen, Sonderkraftfahrzeug 221), first produced in 1935, was a German armoured car used as a reconnaissance vehicle for the German Panzer Divisions during World War II. At 339 vehicle manufactured between 1935 to 1940, the Sd.Kfz. 221 saw use in Nazi Germany's early campaigns in Europe, North Africa, and the Eastern Front. Some of these vehicles were armed with the 2.8 cm sPzB 41, a squeeze-bore anti-tank weapon that was capable of producing high-velocity projectiles to penetrate armour. The Sd.Kfz. 221 in German service was eventually succeeded by the larger Sd.Kfz. 222 design, or the more off-road capable Sd.Kfz. 250 half-tracks.
