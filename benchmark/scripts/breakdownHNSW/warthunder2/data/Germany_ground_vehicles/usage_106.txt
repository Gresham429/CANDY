Usage of DF105: 
Due to its high mobility, high penetration HEAT round, and autoloader, the tank offers great potential for flanking around the frontline and picking off enemy vehicles from a variety of angles. The HEAT round allows the player to destroy nearly every vehicle they might encounter (except for tanks featuring composite armour) at every range. However, the high drop, the low velocity of the ammo, and the lack of a rangefinder make hitting the first shot at longer ranges difficult. Thus, it is best used at around 800 m or in a squad with vehicles featuring rangefinders. The greatest danger to the tank, when in a flanking role, would be other light tanks (especially those outfitted with autocannons), which remain operational after the first shot. Aircraft also pose a high risk to the tank, since the roof armour is only 10 mm thick.
