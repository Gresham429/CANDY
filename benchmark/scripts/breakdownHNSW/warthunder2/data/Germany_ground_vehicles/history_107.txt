History of M48A2_C: 
In the mid 1950s, West Germany received several versions of the M48 Patton III tank from the US. Of these versions were the standard M48A2 and the M48A2C, the latter featuring the M13 fire control system and lacking the rear track tension roller present on the standard M48A2. Later on, these vehicles would be modified by the Germans. They would receive IR equipment, new storage boxes, and banks of four smoke grenades on either side of the turret face. These upgrades were not performed on all German M48A2s and was thus not standardized, however, the vehicles that did receive the upgrades would be unofficially referred to as M48A2 G and M48A2 C G, similar to the M47 which was unofficially referred to as M47 G after it received a similar upgrade. (The vehicle represented in-game is an M48A2 C G) These upgraded vehicles would see service until the 1970's were it was replaced by the M48A2 GA2.
