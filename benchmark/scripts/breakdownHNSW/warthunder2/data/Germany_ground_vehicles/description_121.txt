Description of M48_Super: 
During the Cold War, West Germany acquired as many as 650 M48 Patton tanks from United States. As the years pass, the M48 slowly became outdated and needed constant upgrades to stay up to date with the latest advancements in tank technologies and the Soviet threat. One such upgrade was in the 1960s as the M48A2 C tanks were upgraded into M48A2 G A2 that had the 105 mm L7 cannon installed and also use the German MG3 machine gun. However, as Leopard tanks slowly became Germany's primary tank, the M48 needed one more chance to stay relevant or risk obsolescence. In the 1990s, the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann company started a private venture to modernize the M48A2 with a new engine, appliqu√© armour package, and updated fire control system as the "M48 Super". Although the venture aimed to export this upgrade services to other M48 users across the globe, this came right around the end of the Cold War as all European nations began downsizing their armies by selling their surplus tanks on the market, reducing the need to rely on the old M48 design and ending the venture.
