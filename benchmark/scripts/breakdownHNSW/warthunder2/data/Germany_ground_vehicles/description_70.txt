Description of Panzer_IV/70(A): 
The Panzer IV/70(A) (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 162/1) is the second variant of the Panzer IV medium tank-based tank destroyer family. Hitler ordered Alkett (A), the StuG III's manufacturer, to redesign the Jagdpanzer IV superstructure to accommodate the new main armament in July 1944 so that 75 mm Panzerjägerkanone 42 L/70 tank gun could be sent to the front as soon as possible. Due to the new armament being larger than the previous one, additional vertical steel plates had to be welded onto the chassis to compensate for height differences when mounting the redesigned superstructure onto the original Panzer IV medium tank chassis. From August 1944 to March 1945, only 278 were constructed.
