Usage of Wiesel_1A4: 
The Wiesel 1A4 is small, light and thus has great acceleration, which can help you to get to positions early and to arrive at capture points before the enemies. Given its very low profile, it can hide behind almost everything and can provide support for the team. The Wiesel 1A4 is very lightly armoured, thus it should not be used to attack enemies head-on but instead act as an intelligence vehicle for the team, scouting and marking enemies on the minimap for your teammates. The Rh202 20 mm is effective against lightly armored vehicles, but it has low post-penetration damage, meaning you may need to aim for specific components to do significant damage. It is very effective if used as a spotter because it has Generation 3 thermals, something essentially no other vehicle at its BR can boast, and with its low profile and high mobility it gets around the map extremely effectively. As for anti-aircraft purposes, its limited elevation of 45 degrees can hinder its performance, but the gun makes quick work of any low flying aircraft that fly within your elevation range. With this much scouting, the Wiesel 1A4 can also work as an effective segway into an aircraft, as you can scout enemies constantly while hiding in unorthodox spots and lead your teammates to the unsuspecting enemies in front of you. It is especially effective in uptiers, as you may feel that your other vehicles may not handle opponents of a higher BR bracket, and thus want to support the team via aircraft or helicopters instead.
