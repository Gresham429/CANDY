Description of SPz_BMP-1: 
As part of the Cold War remilitarization, the growing East German National People's Army (NVA) began receiving BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) from both the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Throughout the Cold War, the NVA would receive a total of 1,133 BMP-1s for use in their motorized rifle regiments. Following the reunification of East and West Germany, the Bundeswehr integrated the BMP-1 into its ranks in 1991, upgrading and modifying them into the BMP-1A1 Ost variant to meet Bundeswehr standards. The BMP-1 was eventually retired from service by 1994 and either scrapped or sold to other countries.
