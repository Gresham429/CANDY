Usage of M48A2_G_A2: 
The M48A2 G A2 is similar to the other M48 Pattons in the game except for the need to be more careful and aware of your enemies. It's a decent medium tank with well-sloped frontal armour and average mobility, but what makes M48A2 G A2 stand out is the upgraded engine giving it better mobility, and the upgraded 105 mm L7A3 cannon compared to the US standard 90 mm M41 giving it improved penetration and increased precision against distant targets, though this comes at the cost of higher battle rating. It can unlock DM23 rounds that have a great effect even against enemy vehicles at higher battle ratings when uptiered, and can penetrate their armour with well placed shots.
