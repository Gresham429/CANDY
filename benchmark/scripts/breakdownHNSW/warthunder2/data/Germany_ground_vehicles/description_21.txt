Description of Sd.Kfz.251/9: 
The m.Sch√ºtz.Pz.Wg. (Sd.Kfz.251/9), nicknamed "Stummel", was an infantry support vehicle developed by Nazi Germany during WW2 in 1942. Learning from the lessons in the Eastern Front and with a surplus of 7.5 cm howitzers due to the Panzer IV and StuG III being refitted with more capable anti-tank weapons, the Wehrmacht decided to use the already proven Sd.Kfz.251 platform to mount this gun and use it as an infantry support weapon. Initially armed with just the cannon and a narrow range of fire, the vehicle proved unsatisfactory, but after being refitted with a new gun mount and a coaxial machine gun it was deployed in large numbers in the Eastern Front. It mostly served in Armored Recon Units and was used in areas were tanks couldn't support infantry due to poor terrain or weak infrastructure (like roads or bridges) that the Sd.Kfz.251/9 had no problem crossing, as a direct fire platform it proved very good, reliable, cheap to produce and maintain and it filled the need of a "bunker buster" vehicle in the Eastern Front.
