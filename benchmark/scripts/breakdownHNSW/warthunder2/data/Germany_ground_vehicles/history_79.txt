History of LeKPz_M41: 
The leKPz M41 (short for leichter Kampfpanzer M41 (light MBT M41) was the Bundeswehr variant, serving in the West German Army from 1956 to 1969. The leKPz M41's served in Panzeraufklärungsbatallione (tank reconnaissance batallions) and Panzerjägerbataillione (tank destroyer batallions). Very few served in Panzergrenadierbataillione (tank grenadier bataillions). From 1969, the leKPz M41 was replaced by the Leopard 1 in reconnaissance bataillions and by tank destroyers like the JPz 4-5 and the RakJPz 2 in tank destroyer bataillions. Variants with a slightly modified chassis of the M41 remained in service in the form of SPAA (Flakpanzer M42) as well as in the form of tank howitzers (lePzH M52 and mPzH M44).
