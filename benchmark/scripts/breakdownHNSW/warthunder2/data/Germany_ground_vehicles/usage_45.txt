Usage of StuG_III_G: 
This tank destroyer is best played as a support vehicle. Unlike its predecessors, it has excellent armour and can be nearly invincible from long ranges. However, if playing the StuG close to the front lines, (for example, capturing points) this armour will not be adequate against the close-range power of most vehicles. Any shot which penetrates the armour will most likely destroy the vehicle due to the tight interior layout. The sides are a weak point from any ranges, so try not to show it to the enemy. It is recommended to support teammates from the flanks, attack from long ranges, and refrain from closing the distance even for objectives unless necessary. If properly concealed, the enemy will not know where they are being attacked from as they concentrate their assault forwards.
