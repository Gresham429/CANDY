History of Pz.38(t)_F: 
In 1935, ČKD (Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk), the tank manufacturer in Czechoslovakia, wanted to find a replacement to the LT vz.35 (also known as the Panzer 35(t) in German service). The reason was that the vz.35 was overly complex and had faults that impeded its efficiency. Orders for new tanks would be coming from the gradually growing Czechoslovak army, and so they worked jointly with Škoda Works in the development of this new tank.
