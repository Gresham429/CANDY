Usage of KW_II_754_(r)_(Germany): 
Make sure to plan your route ahead of time make sure to avoid large distances in the open, this is a slow moving tank with a large profile making it an easy target for long barreled guns. Mobility is not a strength of this tank with slow acceleration coupled with a low hull traverse and gun elevation/depression, these aspects of the tank make close range brawling a bad idea. As for top speed in a straight line on flat ground this tank can achieve 30kph. The KV-2 is best used in medium to long range, or in close combat with a second squad mate, where if you fail to destroy a target you can seek cover to reload. It's almost always advisable to be with friendly tanks when taking out the KV-2, because of it's long reload. As for the armour you can bounce shots but don't rely on your armour to save you, since the enemy its faces can pierce its armour even at range. Don't forget that in the half-minute period between your shots enemy tanks can shot you 2 or more times.
