Usage of LeKPz_M41: 
The leKPz M41 is best used as a support tank, covering teammate advances and scouting enemies from afar. While it can be used for brawling, the terrible armour, bouncy gun handling, and inability to destroy enemies quickly mean that this role should be left to other tanks if possible.
