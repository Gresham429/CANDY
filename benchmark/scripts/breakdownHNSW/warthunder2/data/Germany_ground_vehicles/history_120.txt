History of KPz-70: 
Being threatened by the Soviet T-64 tank, Germany and the United States joined together to develop a new main battle tank in the mid-1960s. This became the MBT/KPz-70 project. The new main battle tank would use advanced technology of the time, including hydropneumatic suspension, 152mm gun/launcher capable firing tank shell and ATGM, autoloading system, spaced armour, 1500 horsepower diesel engine and remote-controlled weapon station. Everything looks perfect on paper, but in reality, there were many problems. The autoloading system could load Shillelagh missile quite easily, but it would jam the tank shell. The housing of the driver in a rotating cupola inside the turret would cause an unanticipated problems to the driver. The caseless ammunition would also become unusable if the humidity is high.
