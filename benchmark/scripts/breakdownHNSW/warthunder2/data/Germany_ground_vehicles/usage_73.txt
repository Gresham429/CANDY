Usage of M4_748_(a)_(Germany): 
The M4 748 (a) is a very versatile weapons platform that can be used in multiple roles and tactics. It can use its decent armour and gun to support friendlies against enemies, use its mobility to outmanoeuvre and exploit undefended location to reach an unsuspecting area, and a combination of the traits to deal with its contemporary medium tanks with the 75 mm gun with its APCBC and APCR ammunition.
