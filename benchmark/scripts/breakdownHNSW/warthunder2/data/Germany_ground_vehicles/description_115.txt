Description of Maus: 
The Pz.Kpfw. VIII Maus is a rank V German heavy tank 
with a battle rating of 8.0 (AB) and 7.7 (RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.47 "Big Guns" as a main tree vehicle, however in Update 1.91 "Night Vision" it was shifted to become a gift vehicle for players who previously owned it. It was later reopened to research for a limited time during War Thunder's 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th anniversary events. The Maus is the definitive tank of heavy armour in Rank V and is one of the largest ground vehicles in-game. The Maus can be a menace in the battlefield and conversely also a bullet magnet, a double-edged sword that must be played correctly or else fall victim to heavy enemy fire.
