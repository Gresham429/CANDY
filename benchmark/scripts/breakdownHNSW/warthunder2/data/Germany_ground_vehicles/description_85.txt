Description of Ostwind_II: 
The Flakpanzer IV "Ostwind II" is an up-gunned modification of the Flakpanzer IV "Ostwind", which is the second variant of the Flakpanzer IV self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. To increase the firing rate, the Flakpanzer IV "Ostwind" was redesigned with two 37 mm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 43 cannons. A single prototype was built, but World War II ended before it could be fully completed.
