Usage of Pz.II_C: 
The main key to success with this vehicle is to drive aggressively, trying to take shots at relatively close range (100-300 m or even less). Aim for the enemy's weak spots such as modules and crew members. Go for flank or rear shots in order to make the most of the 20 mm close-range penetration power on the enemy's thinner armour plates.
