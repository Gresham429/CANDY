Usage of PT-16/T14_mod.: 
Due to its good mobility and fast-firing cannon, this tank is perfectly suited for flanking enemy positions or sniping from afar. With its poor armour protection and large frontal ammo rack, taking this tank into a head-on fight is often very dangerous, but it can be a very dangerous run-and-gun tank if the driver has quick reflexes and good target acquisition.
