Description of Pz.IV_J: 
The Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf√ºhrung J (Sd.Kfz. Index: Sd.Kfz. 161/2) is the ninth and the last variant of the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank family. It was manufactured solely at the Nibelungenwerk factory in Sankt Valentin, northern Austria, from January 1944 to the end of April 1945. This variant was distinguished by numerous simplifications made to prior variants to accelerate production and conserve valuable materials. Instead of making further advancements, the Panzer IV J variant is a retrograde development from the previous Panzer IV H variant. This last variant included replacing the single-speed turret traverse electric power drive with a two-gear manual traverse, with the extra space used for fuel storage. This was a last-ditch effort to increase Panzer IV production rate and compensate for tank losses.
