Usage of StuG_III_A: 
The StuG's AP shell can deal with many opponents at its rank. It has devastating when used on the many light tanks at Rank I, whilst your frontal armour can hold a lot of their shells. The front of a StuG III A is not invulnerable however, so you must be cautious as to which enemies you expose yourself to.
