Usage of Class_3_(P): 
The Class 3 is considered like a bigger Radkampfwagen. Due to its speed, it may be used in a flanking manner, being able to go around the enemy and surprise them where they do not expect. When flanking, it is recommended to use roads if possible, as the Class 3 is a wheeled vehicle, and rough terrain will slow it down. However, even off-road, the vehicle is still capable of speeds that are much higher than many other contemporary MBTs.
