Usage of Leopard_2_(PzBtl_123): 
Because the PzBtl 123 is fast, it is good for flanking attacks. If you can manage to get around the enemy undetected, then you can destroy them with your superior armament. Heavy tanks and any vehicle carrying APFSDS shells are a huge menace to the survivability of the vehicle. If you choose to go into frontal combat instead of flanking, you should pop out of cover, fire an APFSDS (DM23 is better than DM13) at an enemy tank's lower armour in the front, and then retreat to cover as quickly as possible. If you do not, a heavy tank may one shot you or a light tank could take out your driver, gunner and commander, and the loader. Be especially wary of other medium tanks that are also trying to flank your team, because chances are, they also have a 120 mm gun and can one shot you with a well placed round.
