Usage of VK_3002_(M): 
The VK 3002 (M) serves as a proper and useful introduction to the Panther line. Its lacklustre reload speed and poor turret traverse speed restrict it to a more passive playstyle, while the high muzzle velocity and low projectile mass allow it to excel at long-distance engagements. However, most maps will force the player to fight in tight, often urban environments. On those maps, the VK 3002 (M) works best when used as a support vehicle, owing to its low versatility yet high frontal armour and a powerful cannon. Staying close to teammates allows the VK to fight without the fear of being flanked, which should be the player's main concern. Leading an assault or pushing deep behind enemy lines should generally be avoided, unless the match is close to being over and the player has to act fast in order to score any more points.
