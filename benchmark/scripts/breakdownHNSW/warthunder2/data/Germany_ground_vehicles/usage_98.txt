Usage of Tiger_II_(H)_Sla.16: 
Considering most of the players who use this vehicle will be using it in RB/SB, this section will be directed to them. The Tiger II can be used both as a brawler and a sniper. With its excellent 88 mm KwK43 gun and reliable armour layout, the Tiger II can take a fair few shots before getting knocked out. Try not to let your flanks become exposed if playing in urban maps especially. On open maps, you should stick to towns or hills and remain hull down to utilize your thick turret cheeks well. Aim for noticeable weak spots on enemies, ie. lower glacis shots or ammo rack shots will more often than not result in a reliable way to destroy them. The gun has a solid rate of fire, not too slow, so you can follow up with a return shot fairly quickly.
