History of Class_3_(P): 
The Henschel Wehrtechnik TH200, TH600 and TH800 were a series of armoured vehicles developed in Germany in the early '80s as test vehicles that could undertake a wide variety of combat roles. These vehicles have a hull of welded steel armour that provides guaranteed protection to low and high-calibre machine gun fire but lacks protection against anti-tank weaponry. A series of 3 versions were done: The TH200 4x4, the TH600 6x6 and TH800 8x8. Each one of the variants had their own combat roles.
