History of Leopard_2A7V: 
In the mid 2010s, the German government backtracked on plans to reduce the size of the armoured force in the Bundeswehr. Instead, a plan was formulated with Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann, the manufacturer of the Leopard 2 MBT, to produce additional vehicles under a new and improved standard.
