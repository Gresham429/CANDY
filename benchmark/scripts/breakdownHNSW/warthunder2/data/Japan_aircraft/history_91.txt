History of B-17E_(Japan): 
After the successful invasion of the Philippines, a team of Japanese engineers from the IJAAF "Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo" (Army Aviation Technical Research Institute) discovered multiple B-17 wrecks at Clark Field. Salvaging parts from the various wrecks, the engineers managed to piece together a working B-17D, which was flown back to the Japanese home islands in early 1942 for evaluation.
