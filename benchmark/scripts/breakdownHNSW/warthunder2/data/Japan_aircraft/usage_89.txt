Usage of J2M4_Kai: 
Generally, the J2M4 performs similarly to the early Fw 190 A variants, having a deadly armament, good roll rate, low top speed, but higher climb rate. Use what the Raiden does best to achieve success - energy fighting. Instead of turn fighting or bleeding all built up energy or speed in turns, attack enemies from a higher altitude and then regain that altitude once the attack has been delivered. The J2M4 excels at Boom & Zoom due to its high rate of climb and deadly armament, even more so than its earlier variants, the J2M2 and J2M3.
