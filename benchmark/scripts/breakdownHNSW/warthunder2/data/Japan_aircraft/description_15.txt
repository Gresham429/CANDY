Description of B5N2: 
The B5N2, designated as the Type 97 Carrier Attack Bomber (九七式艦上攻撃機), was the standard Japanese carrier-based torpedo/high-level bomber during World War II. With its first flight in 1937, it served the Japanese Navy very favourably with its highly capable ordnance and was considerably faster than any Allied counterparts. Due to delays in the production of the B6N (Family), the B5N saw service from 1937 all the way until 1945, supplementing the B6Ns in secondary roles. While it saw initial service in the Second Sino-Japanese war, it played a major role in the opening phase of the Pacific war, contributing to the successes at Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway, and Santa Cruz Islands.
