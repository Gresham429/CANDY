Usage of N1K2-Ja: 
The N1K2-Ja is a very tricky aircraft to use. It can face early jet fighters such as the F-80A-5, Yak-15/17, He 162, J/A21R, and in Arcade, the F-84B-26. These jet aircraft hold a hefty speed advantage over the Shiden-Kai, but typically have very poor manoeuvrability, meaning the N1K pilot can abuse its excellent handling at medium speeds and shred the previously mentioned jets if their pilots are foolish enough to try and turn-fight. The one exception to this is the Yak-15, which retains the turning abilities of its airframe; the Yak-3. However, the Yak-15 suffers from a relatively low top speed and climb rate for a jet, along with sub-par vertical energy retention. Above all those, its ammunition pool is abysmal at only 120 rounds total, meaning the N1K2 pilot could potentially win an engagement just by remaining difficult to hit.
