Description of G8N1: 
The G8N1, designated as Renzan (連山), was a four-engine heavy bomber designed by Nakajima Aircraft Company for the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1943. It was intended to be a long-range land-based attack plane that could carry a large bomb load and reach speeds of 590 km/h. The first prototype flew in October 1944 and was delivered to the Navy for testing in January 1945. However, the project faced many difficulties due to material shortages, especially aluminium, and Allied air raids. Only four prototypes and three production models were completed before the program was cancelled in June 1945.
