History of Ki-32: 
The Ki-32 was developed in response to a 1936 Imperial Japanese Army specification to replace the ageing and inferior Ki-3. Both Mitsubishi and Kawasaki were requested to build two prototypes by Christmas. The specification required a top speed of 400 km/h at 3,000 m with a normal operating altitude from 2,000 to 4,000 m and the ability to climb to that height in 8 minutes. The companies needed to choose between utilizing an 825 hp Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial, an 850 hp Nakajima Ha-5 radial or an 850 hp Kawasaki Ha-9-IIb liquid-cooled inline engines.
