Usage of J2M5: 
Although a stubby and small aircraft, the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden can be considered one of the best Japanese fighters. Wielding four 20 mm cannons, this aircraft is more than capable of dealing with heavy damage. However, the main advantage the Raiden has over its Allied counterparts is its climb rate. In Realistic Battles, the J2M5 can climb to higher altitudes very quickly, especially when given an air start. This facet of the Raiden's performance is particularly exemplified in the J2M5, the last in-game variant of the Raiden that features the greatest performance of the series. This is partially due to its mechanically-driven supercharger which allows the J2M5 to perform at altitudes once thought impossible by Japanese engineers. Once at a high altitude, it becomes possible to choose when, where, and who the J2M5 want to fight. The J2M5's 20 mm cannons may initially seem rather lacklustre but they have a knack for snapshots or quick bursts of fire that result in a victory while manoeuvring. Generally, the J2M5 performs similarly to the early Fw 190 A variants, having a deadly armament, good roll rate, low top speed, but higher climb rate. The J2M5 differs from this rule slightly as it was built for speed and high-altitude performance. The Raiden is best used as an energy fighter - instead of "turning and burning", or losing all built up speed in turns, attack enemies from a higher altitude and then regain that altitude once the attack has been delivered. The J2M5 excels at Boom & Zoom due to its high rate of climb, deadly armament, and high altitude characteristics.
