Description of B7A2_(Homare_23): 
The B7A2 (Homare 23) Ryusei was a prototype to test the new Homare 23 engine on the B7A2 which boasted 200 hp more than the Homare 12 installed on the production line of the B7A2. Other than the engine, the fuselage, wings, and armament haven't changed resulting in an enhanced B7A2 which wasn't able to be mass-produced.
