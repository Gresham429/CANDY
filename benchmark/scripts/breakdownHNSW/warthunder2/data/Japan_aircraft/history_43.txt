History of A7He1: 
As the He 112 was being phased out of German service in favour of the Bf 109, the Germans started considering exporting the design. The first nation placing an order was Japan, who ordered 30 He 112 B-0 to be used on the Chinese front by the Navy. The Japanese Naval designation for the He 112 B-0 was A7He1 (A7 Heinkel 1), as the A6M Zero was still in tweaking stage.
