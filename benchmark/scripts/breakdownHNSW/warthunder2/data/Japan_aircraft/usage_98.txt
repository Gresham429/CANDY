Usage of Kikka: 
The Kikka has a good acceleration rate for its BR, as well as climb rate, and low top speed compared to later jets. The pilot is quite heavily protected from the front and rear by both armour, and the fuel tanks are self sealing. The (wing mounted) engines, on the other hand, take damage easily, and minor damage to them will further slow the plane to speeds that some props can match.
