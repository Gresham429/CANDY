History of R2Y2_Kai_V3: 
The single-seat land-based Kugisho R2Y2 Keiun-Kai or "Beautiful Cloud" was a planned jet-powered Reconnaissance Bomber/Attacker based on the two-seat R2Y1 Keiun. The R2Y2 would feature an armament of 4 x 30 mm Type 5 cannons and an external bomb load of up to 800 kg. The powerplant of the jet Keiun-Kai would be a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines mounted in pods located, with one under each wing. Later versions (V2 and V3) would feature the engines mounted centrally within the fuselage.
