Description of D3A1: 
The D3A1, designated as Type 99 Carrier Dive Bomber (九九式艦上爆撃機) was a carrier-based dive bomber that served in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. It was the first Japanese plane to strike American targets, starting with the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941. It also took part in almost all major Japanese carrier operations in the first year of the war, such as the Indian Ocean Raid, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway. The Aichi D3A replaced the older D1A biplane and was influenced by the German Heinkel He 70. The Aichi D3A1 was accurate and reliable. It sank more Allied ships than any other Axis plane, but faced heavy losses as the war went on and newer Allied fighters surpassed it.
