Description of Fw_190_A-5_(Japan): 
The ▅Fw 190 A-5 was loaned to the Japanese Army to examine its performance and design for their own IJAAS. The diving speed impressed them, but its agility disappointed, and Army decided not to produce or license more units. Instead, Kawasaki engineers learned from its features, especially its powerful air-cooled engine, which inspired the development of the Ki-100s engine that replaced the one in the Ki-61. The Army tested the Fw 190 against other foreign planes they had acquired, such as the Bf 109 E-7, P-51C 'Evalina' and their own domestic planes Ki-61 and the advanced Ki-84. They ranked the Fw 190 second after the P-51C, noting that its horizontal speed and maneuverability were not very impressive, while its diving speed was outstanding.
