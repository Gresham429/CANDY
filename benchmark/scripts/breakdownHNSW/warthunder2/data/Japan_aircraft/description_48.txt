Description of Bf_109_E-7_(Japan): 
The â–…Bf 109 E-7 was a variant of the German fighter aircraft Messerschmitt Bf 109, one of the first modern fighters of the World War II era. The Bf 109 E-7 had a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 DB 601 engine, and a 20 mm MG FF cannon in each wing. Japan acquired five Bf 109 E-7s from Germany in 1941 for testing purposes. The acquired planes had the standard hinomarus and yellow wing leading edges, as well as white numbers and a red stripe on the rudder. The Japanese Army compared the Bf 109 E-7s with their latest Ki-44 and found that the Bf 109 E-7 was inferior in every aspect. They assumed that the Japanese plane development was on par with the newest Western fighters, unaware that the newer Bf 109 F was already available for German frontline troops. The planes were distributed across multiple air bases to train new pilots and compare to other Japanese planes. The main benefit the Japanese got out of the Bf 109 E-7 was the DB 601 engine license which enabled the Japanese to use a high-power inline engine in their own designs.
