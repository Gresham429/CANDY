History of Ki-84_otsu: 
The design of the Ki-84 traces back to late 1942 when Nakajima accepted an order by the IJAAF to create an improved aircraft to replace the Ki-43 Hayabusa that was just entering service, with the requirement asking for a fast, nimble, simple but universal aircraft so that the Japanese could ease the stress on their factories. Nakajima used several elements from their previous designs - The Ki-44 Shoki and the Ki-43 Hayabusa - and took pilot complaints from said aircraft and worked on addressing them with the new aircraft, specifically the poor speed, climb rate, acceleration and weak airframe of the Ki-43 and the weak armament and flying difficulty of the Ki-44.
