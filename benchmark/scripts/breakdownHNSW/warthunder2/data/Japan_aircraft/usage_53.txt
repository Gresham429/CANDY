Usage of A6M5: 
The A6M5 is an excellent dogfighter, nearly peerless in a low-speed engagement, even the renowned Spitfire looks clumsy and slow compared to an A6M5. However, it faces some extremely difficult opponents. Many opposing fighters tend to be specialized in performance-based energy manoeuvres with Boom and Zoom fighting styles rather than the classic turning and dogfighting of the A6M5. This can lead to the A6M5 struggling to engage them on the offensive due to its weak performance and low top speed and all too often is forced onto the defensive. The Zero is capable of evading attacks and striking back, but it requires a confident and knowledgeable pilot.
