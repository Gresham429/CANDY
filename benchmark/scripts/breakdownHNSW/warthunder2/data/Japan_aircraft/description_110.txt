Description of F-4EJ_Phantom_II: 
The F-4EJ was a version of the Phantom II, a versatile fighter jet designed by McDonnell Douglas in the late 1950s. Japan bought 140 F-4EJs in 1968, based on the F-4E model used by the U.S. Air Force, but with some changes such as the removal of aerial refueling and ground attack capabilities. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also built 138 F-4EJs under license. The F-4EJ served as Japan's main air defense fighter for many years, until it was gradually replaced by the Mitsubishi F-2 and the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. Japan also operated a reconnaissance version of the F-4EJ, the RF-4EJ, which had no weapons and carried cameras and sensors. The RF-4EJ retired in March 2020, followed by the last F-4EJ in December 2020, marking the end of an era for Japan's "Phantastic Phantoms".
