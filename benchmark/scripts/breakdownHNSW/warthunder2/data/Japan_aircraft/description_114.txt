Description of F-15J: 
The F-15J Eagle is a variant of the American F-15 Eagle customized for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and produced under a licensing agreement with the United States, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries taking the lead in manufacturing. The F-15J, which entered service in the early 1980s, was designed to replace Japan's ageing fleet of F-104J Eikos and F-4EJ Phantoms. This twin-engine, all-weather air superiority fighter featured advanced radar and avionics for long-range engagement. The aircraft's design emphasized air-to-air combat capabilities, featuring a mix of short and medium-range missiles, the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow respectively, on top of the domestic AAM-3 missile.
