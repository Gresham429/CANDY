Usage of Ki-45_tei: 
The Ki-45 tei features the first "Schr√§ge Musik" armament of the series. Wielding one Ho-204 37 mm cannon and two Ho-5 20 mm cannons, the Ki-45 tei is the definition of a bomber hunter. Its 37 mm cannon allows the Toryu to take down bombers with ease, and its dual 20 mm cannons allow for even more flexibility in the bomber hunting department. Although deadly, the 37 mm cannon only holds 15 rounds, so shot placement is crucial. The round itself also travels fairly slowly in the air, making it hard to hit fast moving enemy fighters. The 20 mm cannons are best used in a secondary weapon role, as they are fixed at an upward angle. To use these weapons, one must bind a key to them via the in-game controls menu (it is on the first page that comes up, basic). Unique to the tei model, this Ki-45's ground attack role is improved due to the ability to equip bombs.
