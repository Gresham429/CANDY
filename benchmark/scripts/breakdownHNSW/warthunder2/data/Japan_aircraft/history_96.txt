History of Ki-94-II: 
The Ki-94-II was Tachikawa Aircraft Company's response to the Japanese Imperial Army Air Force demands for a fast, high altitude interceptor featuring heavy armament as soon as Japanese intelligence learned about the B-29 to counter the B-29 raids as the aircraft available at that time for the IJAAF were inadequate to combat B-29s. The Ki-94-II was developed from the original Ki-94; the Ki-94-I which was an experimental high altitude interceptor with 2 propellers and a twin-tailed boom configuration (such as the tail of the Venom and the Vampire), one was a normal propeller on the front and the other was a pusher prop on the back. The Ki-94-II was created by Tatsuo Hasegawa. There were 2 prototypes of the Ki-94-II, one was fitted with a 4-blade propeller and the other one was to be fitted with a 6-blade propeller however the war ended before any of the prototypes made their maiden flight so the project was cancelled. The aircraft had 2 x 20 mm Ho-5 cannons and 2 x 30 mm Ho-155-I cannons, 150 rpg per 20 mm and 30 mm, 600 rounds in total.
