Usage of Ki-44-II_hei: 
In-game, the Ki-44 is the pinnacle of point interceptors at its battle rating. At the beginning of any match, use your amazing climb rate to get as high as you can. If you climb at around a 22Â° angle, you should be able to find yourself far above enemy bombers by the time you encounter them. If there are bombers, those 4 x 12.7s machine guns can do a number on a bomber, but the bombers defences can also do a lot to you. When attacking a bomber, do it in high-speed passes, giving the gunners minimal time to lock on to you. Aim for the wings of the bomber as, while not exactly high velocity, your shells can do a lot of damage to a bomber's wing.
