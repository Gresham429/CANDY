Description of F-86F-30_(Japan): 
The F-86F-30 ("NA-191" as North American called it) was the first Sabre to be built with bombing in mind. Earlier Sabres had pitiful endurance when carrying bombs, which became an issue. This led to North American designing the NA-191, which had four hardpoints, either for more fuel or bombs. The combat range was greatly increased, which remedied the main issue of the Sabre's role as a fighter-bomber. The F-86F-30 would soon find a home in Japan. Although Japan was not allowed to have an air force after the war, Allied nations eased up on the restriction and allowed the Japan Air Self Defence Force in 1953. A year later, after the air force was established, they picked the F-86F to be their main fighter. 29 F-86F-25/30s were brought in from US surplus. Many early F-86Fs were brought up to the F-40 standard, which featured improved handling with leading-edge slats.
