Description of F-1: 
The Mitsubishi F-1 was the first supersonic fighter jet designed and built by Japan, as a joint project of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries. It derived from the Mitsubishi T-2 advanced jet trainer, which was influenced by the SEPECAT Jaguar. The F-1 had a specialized role in anti-ship and ground attack missions, with upgraded avionics, airframe and weapons capacity, including seven hardpoints and a built-in JM61A1 Vulcan. It replaced the F-86 Sabres in the JASDF's arsenal.
