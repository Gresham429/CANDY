Usage of Ki-87: 
Unlike the usual Japanese low-altitude and highly manoeuvrable fighter aircraft, the Ki-87 is a high-altitude bomber interceptor with mediocre speed and climb rate but less impressive agility. Featuring something relatively new for a Japanese fighter, the Ki-87 has a notably visible turbo-supercharger to boost its high-altitude performance at the cost of aircraft weight and size. As such, it cannot be played like most other aircraft from the Japanese tree, but rather as a reserved Boom-&-Zoom that can abuse its brutal acceleration in a dive to pick off unwary victims.
