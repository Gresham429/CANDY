History of F-86F-30_(Japan): 
Following the Japanese defeat and the end of the Second World War, Japan was prohibited from maintaining armed forces of its own. Following the disbanding of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in 1945, this decision was written into law in the 1947 Constitution. While the original article declared that Japan would never resort to war as an instrument to settle disputes and would never maintain land, sea or air forces or other instruments of war, later on the exact meaning of this article was questioned by successive governments as it meant Japan was fully dependent on the occupying Allied forces to come to its defence in case of an armed conflict. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 only furthered this concern, and a new interpretation of the constitutional article came into being: while Japan was prohibited from maintaining an offensive force, the article did not state that they were also prohibited from maintaining a purely defensive force.
