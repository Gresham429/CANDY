History of Ki-21-Ia: 
In 1936, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service issued a requirement for a new heavy bomber to replace two previous models. This new heavy bomber had to have a crew of four to six men, a top speed of 400 km/h (250 mph), had to be able to carry a bomb load greater than 750 kg (1,650 lb), had to be able to climb to altitude in less than 8 minutes, and had to take off in less than 300 m (980 ft). The new bomber also had to utilize Nakajima Ha-5 or Mitsubishi Ha-6 engines and had to contain specific models of radios, among many other specifications. These requirements were quite extensive and there weren't many heavy bombers in existence at the time that could perform at these standards.
