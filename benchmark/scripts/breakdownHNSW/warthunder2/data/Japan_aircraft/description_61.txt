Description of P1Y1_mod._11: 
The P1Y1 Ginga was a land-based long-range (dive-)bomber that was requested by the Japanese Navy after learning of the successes in the European theatres and out of their own experience with their own Type 96 G3Ms (and later Type 1 G4Ms) attack bombers lacking the ability to commit dive bombing actions. Initial development began by examining a purchased Ju 88 A with little real valuable lessons being drawn from the Ju 88 and development continued, with the last prototypes being rushed to be used in service production due to the lengthy development time and deterioration of the war situation. This resulted in a late-war multirole high-speed bomber that was troubled with maintenance and overall production numbers.
