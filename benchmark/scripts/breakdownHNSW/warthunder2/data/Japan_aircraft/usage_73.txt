Usage of A6M5_Hei: 
In Air RB, your primary focus is to engage fighters. Do not bring any payload options for this plane, as it will weigh you down significantly. Select 400 m for the gun convergence, use the Ground Targets belt for your 13 mm guns, and the Universal or Tracers belts for your 20 mm cannons. Climb at a 15Â° angle and you may want to try a slight side climb on smaller maps. Try climbing and staying with your team. You will be outclassed by many fighters, so play to your strengths. Engage targets that have low energy states, and try to dogfight them. Do not engage in head-ons or high altitude fighting and stay close to your allied aircraft, as the A6M5 hei works well when an enemy is overfocused on an allied plane. Try not to stall out in this plane, as your weight is increased and the relatively weak engine won't allow you to recover from stalls easily.
