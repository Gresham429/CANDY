History of B7A2: 
Two-seat carrier-based Aichi B7A2 Ryusei "Shooting Star" or "Meteor" Torpedo/Dive Bomber (Allied reporting name: Grace). The B7A was an answer to a specification for a carrier-based torpedo/dive bomber in 1941. It was intended to replace B6N and D4Y, having an internal and external payload, increased speed and long-range. Some of the design features of the B7A include; inverted gull-wings, conventional fuselage, and tail unit and a four-bladed propeller. During its development, it went through a series of shortcomings, such as the delivery of engines, and an accidental earthquake which destroyed the main factory housing most of the B7As. Thus not seeing active service until 1944. By this time, there were no aircraft carriers capable of operating the B7A. The last aircraft carrier being the Shinano was sunk 10 days after its commission. The B7A2 was then forced to operate in home defence operations, seeing limited service.
