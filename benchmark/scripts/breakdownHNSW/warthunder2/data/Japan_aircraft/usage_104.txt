Usage of R2Y2_Kai_V3: 
The R2Y2 is best utilized as a medium-altitude fighter in all game modes. Due to its lacklustre acceleration, gaining airspeed as early as possible is crucial. Once the R2Y2 pilot loses his or her speed, they are easy prey for fast-accelerating planes like the F7F. It is important to always have a high speed when attacking enemies as they will often be able to slot in on your tail in a matter of seconds. This short time can be a matter of life or death as many fast-turning propeller aircraft such as the Spitfire wield impressive armaments with high burst masses. However, these advantages can be nullified once the R2Y2 pilot has the ability to dive away at high speeds.
