Usage of F-4EJ_ADTW: 
The F-4EJ Phantom is well-suited for ground attacks, with a generous amount of options for bombs and rockets. Against air targets, players may employ the vehicle's air-to-air missiles and deadly frontal cannon. If desired, three externally-mounted gun pods may be equipped, but note that these may not be useful in all situations. Although they will undoubtedly increase the vehicle's destructive capabilities, they also appreciably hinder flight performance. In many situations, one front-facing cannon is all that is required to dispatch an opponent aircraft. As for the infrared missiles, the ones used by this plane are decent in the game, comparable to the R-60 missiles equipped by the MiG-21MF (Germany) and the MiG-21SMT.
