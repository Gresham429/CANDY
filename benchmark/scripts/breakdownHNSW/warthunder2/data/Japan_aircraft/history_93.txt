History of A6M6c: 
In late 1944 into early 1945, the skies over the Pacific Ocean were ruled by US military aviation. The Japanese Empire was forced to deploy the already obsolete Zero against up-to-date Corsairs and Hellcats, because the development of new models of carrier-based fighter aircraft was delayed, and new Japanese army fighters often lacked range to win a tactical initiative. The design team of Mitsubishi did everything possible in an attempt to bring the Zero to the level of modern Allied combat aviation.
