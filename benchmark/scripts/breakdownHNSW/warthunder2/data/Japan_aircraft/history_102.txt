History of R2Y2_Kai_V1: 
The R2Y2 was a jet-powered version of the R2Y1 designed by Kugisho. Known as the Keiun or Keiun-Kai ("Beautiful Cloud" in Japanese) the aircraft would be a high-speed jet-bomber/attacker that could be used in the defence of the home islands of the Japanese empire. The power plant of the jet Keiun-Kai would be a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines mounted in pods located, with one under each wing. Later versions (V2 and V3) would feature the engines mounted centrally within the fuselage.
