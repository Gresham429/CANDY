Due to this, the A6M6c is less specialized in dogfight compared to the other Zeros, but is generally more versatile and forgiving than the its peer. The plane is capable of executing high-speed manoevers and diving attacks, and is capable of taking damage. Though, being a Zero, it also inherit weakness from the other Zeros such as slow speed and volatile fuel tanks.
