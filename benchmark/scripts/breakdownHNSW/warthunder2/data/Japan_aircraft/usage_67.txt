Usage of Ki-67-I_otsu: 
The Ki-67 can be used in air arcade battles to an excellent extent. In Arcade Battles, it can use its bombs to effectively destroy many ground units, playing an important role in ticket count. To start, take the eight 100 kg bombs and dive to the deck. Stay away from the main group of fighters, as it is advisable to stay on the outside of the map to avoid fighter confrontation. Next, bomb any ground targets you see. Tanks and pillboxes can only be destroyed with direct hits, so use the manoeuvrability of this bomber to drop your bombs with precision. Do not drop bombs on bases, as your payload is not as big as that of heavy bombers.
