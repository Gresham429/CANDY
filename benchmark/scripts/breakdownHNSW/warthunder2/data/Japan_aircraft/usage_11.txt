Usage of Ki-45_otsu: 
This variant of the Ki-45, the Ki-45 otsu, features the first "hard-hitting" armament of the series. Wielding two Ho-103 12.7 mm guns and one 37 mm Type 94 cannon, the Ki-45 otsu is the pinnacle of a multi-purpose aircraft. Its 37 mm cannon allows it to take down bombers with ease, and its nose-mounted 12.7 mm guns allows for some flexibility in the dogfighting department. Although deadly, the 37 mm cannon only holds 16 rounds, so shot placement is crucial. The round itself also travels fairly slowly in the air, making it hard to hit fast moving enemy fighters. The 12.7 mm guns is best used in an anti-fighter role. Fortunately, the Ki-45 otsu can also be used in an anti-tank role, thanks to the AP rounds for the 37 mm cannon (42 mm penetration), which can take out light and medium tanks, light pillboxes, and even a few player controlled tanks. The Ki-45 is unable to equip bombs.
