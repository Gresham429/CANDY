History of Ki-44-II_hei: 
The design of the Ki-44 Shoki (Allied Code Name: Tojo) traces back to Nakajima's other infamous IJAAF aircraft; The Ki-43 Hayabusa. Soon after the design of the Ki-43, Nakajima received orders from the Imperial Japanese Army for an interceptor aircraft with a precedence of speed and rate of climb over the traditional manoeuvrability-focused aircraft the Japanese were more known for. Nakajima set to work on the prototype immediately, choosing the company's own Ha-141 radial engine that provided 1,250 in optimal condition. It was similarly constructed to the Ki-43, retaining the excellent Butterfly Combat Flaps and basic design, and carried two 7.7 mm Type 89 machine guns and two of the recently designed 12.7 mm Ho-103 HMG's that were based on the American Browning M1921. The aircraft's first flight occurred in 1940 and was involved in tests versus Kawasaki's Ki-60 prototype, which was powered by the German DB 601 engine used in the early Bf 109's, and an imported Bf 109 E. Through the many trials and evaluations, it was found to be superior to both designs and was ordered for production under the designation "Army Type 2 Single seat Fighter Model 1A Shoki" and company designation of Ki-44-Ia. The first production variants were fitted with the same armament layout as the prototypes but was found to be lacklustre, so was changed to four Ho-103 HMG's in a model dubbed Ki44-Ib. Only some 40 odd Ki-44-Ia's were made including the improved Ib and Ic models.
