Usage of Fw_190_A-5_(Japan): 
The Fw 190 A-5, as all the planes in this line, are some of the best Boom & Zoomers in the game and should be flown exclusively in this style. The performance at high speeds is excellent, as are their dive and zoom characteristics. Do not ever engage in a turn fight as this will most likely end badly, instead only fight in the vertical. Try to have an altitude, or speed, advantage over the opponents (by climbing to the side at the start of the battle and then entering the highest dogfight). But the Fw 190 can still win fights when in a lower energy state than the foe.
