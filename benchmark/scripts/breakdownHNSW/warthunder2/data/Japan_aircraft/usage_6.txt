Usage of Ki-10-II_C: 
The Ki-10-II's low speed and tight turning ability make it a great turn-fighter, like most Japanese light fighters. The Ki-10-II excels at low and slow turn fighting at very low altitudes where enemies cannot out-dive it. Additionally, it has a climb rate to climb away from enemy biplanes. Very fast dives should be avoided, as the wings will shear off at very high speeds. Similarly, turning stalls should be avoided, as the Ki-10-II has a tendency to enter uncontrollable spins.
