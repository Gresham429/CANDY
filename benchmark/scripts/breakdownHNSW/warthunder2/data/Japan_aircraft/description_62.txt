Description of B7A2: 
The B7A2 Ryusei was a carrier-borne torpedo-dive bomber developed by Aichi for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service during the Second World War. It was designed to replace the B6N Tenzan and the D4Y Suisei in the Navy's service. It had a mid-wing configuration with an inverted gull wing, a four-bladed propeller, and a bomb bay. It was powered by the Nakajima NK9C Homare 12 radial engine, which was expected to become the Navy's standard engine in its power range. The plane was intended to operate from the new Taih≈ç-class carriers, which had larger deck elevators than the older carriers. The plane first flew in May 1942, but production was delayed by various problems with the engine and the airframe. Only 114 planes were built before the war ended. The plane saw limited action in the final stages of the war, mainly from land bases, and did not have much opportunity to demonstrate its potential.
