Description of Kikka: 
The Kikka is the first Japanese jet and was a land-based attack plane developed by Nakajima for the IJNAS to attack US warships at high speed and close range with bombs. Taking inspiration from German jet development and advancement, the Kikka, contrary to common belief, was completely domestic in development and role for Japanese needs. Construction of the Kikka was simplified to allow unskilled labor and mass produce the jet plane to build up a large reserve of homeland defense and strike at American vessels. With the war ending, two prototypes were tested, 23 more proto-frames were under construction, and production halted.
