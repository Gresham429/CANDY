Description of A6M2: 
The A6M2 Mod. 21,  designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 21 (零式艦上戦闘機二一型), was the most common version of the Zero encountered by Allied pilots. The A6M2 had excellent manoeuvrability and long range, making it a formidable carrier-borne dogfighter in the early stages of the war. It participated in several major battles, such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, and the Aleutian Islands campaign. However, it also had some weaknesses, such as lack of armour, self-sealing fuel tanks, or hydraulic boosters. As the war progressed, the A6M2 Model 21 became outmatched by newer and more powerful Allied fighters, such as the F6F Hellcat and the F4U Corsair.
