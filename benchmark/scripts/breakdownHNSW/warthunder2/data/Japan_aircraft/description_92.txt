Description of Ki-87: 
The Ki-87 was a high-altitude fighter-interceptor designed to counter the American B-29 Superfortress raids on Japan. It was powered by a Nakajima Ha-44-12 radial engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger, which gave it a high performance at altitudes above 10,000 meters. The Ki-87 had a pressurized cockpit, a four-bladed propeller, and a rearward folding undercarriage. It was armed with two 30 mm and two 20 mm cannons, and could carry a 250 kg bomb under the fuselage. The Ki-87 was developed from 1942, but faced delays due to technical problems and material shortages. Only one prototype was completed and flown in April 1945, but no production aircraft were built before the end of the war.
