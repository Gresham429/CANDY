Description of B6N1_Model_11: 
The B6N1 Model 11, designated as Tenzan Mod.11 (天山一一型), was a carrier-based torpedo bomber developed by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. It was intended to replace the B5N, but faced several delays due to engine problems and stability issues. The first prototype flew in March 1941, but the production did not enter service until August 1943. The B6N1 was powered by the Nakajima Mamoru 11 engine and could carry up to 800 kg of bombs or 1,800 kg of torpedoes. It had a top speed of 481 km/h and a range of over 3,000 km. It was armed with two 7.7 mm machine guns, one in the dorsal turret and one in the ventral position. It was used in various operations, such as the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, but it could not fully demonstrate its potential due to the lack of experienced pilots and the air superiority of the US Navy.
