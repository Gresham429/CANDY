Usage of F-1: 
The F-1 is a challenging aircraft to fly at its high BR, as it has mediocre flight performance and only rear-aspect missiles. The F-1 should adopt a passive playstyle and rely on the team's support. The AIM-9Ps can be very effective if the enemy is unaware of or distracted by the F-1's presence. However, if the enemy is alert and dodging, the F-1 will have a hard time finding a good launch angle, even with the radar-slaving feature. Moreover, many aircraft have flares that can decoy the missiles. Therefore, surprise is essential for the F-1's success. The F-1's cannon can also be very effective with accurate or lucky shots, but dogfighting is not recommended for this aircraft due to its inferior performance. The F-1 consumes a lot of fuel, so 30 minutes of fuel is at minimum recommended for most matches. Like the T-2, the F-1's wings will break off in high-speed negative G manoeuvres. Another drawback of the F-1 is that it lacks any countermeasures such as flares or chaff, which can be compensated by loading FFAR missiles and using them as makeshift flares, but this will increase the drag for the plane in exchange for more survivability against missiles.
