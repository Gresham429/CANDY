Description of Ki-200: 
The Ki-200 Shūsui (秋水, Swinging Sword) was intended to be a license-built copy of the Me 163 Komet, but with shipping problems of getting a functional Me 163 as an example, Japanese engineers were tasked to reverse engineer both the plane and rocket engine from a flight operations manual and other limited documentation. With the project being one of the few joint ventures between the IJAAS and IJNAS, the Army wanted to redesign the fuselage while the Navy wanted to keep the German-proven frame, which eventually won by design and contracted to Mitsubishi to produce the design as J8M and Ki-200 for the Navy and Army respectively.
