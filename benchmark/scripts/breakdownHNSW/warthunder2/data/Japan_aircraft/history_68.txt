History of Ki-100-II: 
The Ki-100 was an fighter/interceptor which was developed from the Ki-61-II and the result of Japan's need to stop American bombing raids over the mainland. In October of 1944, the decision was made to fit 3 Ki-61s with Ha-112 radial engines, which were lighter and more reliable then the Ha-140 inline engine that the Ki-61 used. On February 1, 1945, the modified Ki-61 made its first flight, where it performed well. Continued testing throughout March and April proved that it outperformed the Ki-84, then considered the best fighter in the IJAAF's operation. In March 1945, because of its favourable performance, coupled with its much more reliable engine, it was ordered into production and given the Ki-100 designation. It began combat service on March 9, and was used mainly for its intended purpose until the Japanese surrender in 1945. A total of 396 were built.
