History of D3A1: 
Developed as the 11-Shi Carrier Dive-Bomber, it was a specification ordered by the Imperial Japanese Navy Aviation Bureau to replace the obsolete D1A biplane. The task was undertaken by Mitsubishi, Nakajima, and Aichi, with Mitsubishi dropping out of the design contest early after submitting their design. With the Navy having a civilian model of the Heinkel He 70 for evaluation and testing, Aichi decided to use the plane as a template, while Nakajima based theirs on their own B5N torpedo bomber and C3N recon plane.
