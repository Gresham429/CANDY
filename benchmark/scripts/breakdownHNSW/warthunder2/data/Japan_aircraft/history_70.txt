History of P-51C-11-NT_(Japan): 
Starting early 1943, the Japanese had a new foe to fight in the skies, the P-51 Mustang. While Japan saw early successes, it still would prove that the P-51 is a very dangerous foe. The threat would become worse with the introduction of the Merlin-engined P-51B/C and P-51D.
