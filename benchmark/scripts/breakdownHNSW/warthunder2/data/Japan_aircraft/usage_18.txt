Usage of Ki-32: 
The first thing you will notice upon flying the Ki-32 is that it is incredibly nimble, especially in AB. It can out-turn anything that's not a biplane. A spaded Ki-32 with no bombs can out-turn early Spitfires, and a smart pilot will use this incredible manoeuvrability to their advantage. However, all this manoeuvrability comes at a dangerous cost. With no armour, a vulnerable cockpit, and a weak airframe, you cannot afford to take any damage. As such, you should avoid engagements at all costs.
