Usage of G8N1: 
In all game modes, the G8N1 excels at the traditional heavy bomber role of bombing strategic targets like air bases or factories. Maps like New Guinea and Midway feature enemy airfields. If destroyed, they will net your team an auto-win. Unfortunately, it takes multiple Renzans equipped with the full bomb load to destroy an airfield on the first attack run. Other maps such as Saipan do not have airfields. Instead, an array of carriers serve as the enemy's bases. It is possible to destroy all of the carriers and win the round, but again requires multiple Renzans or multiple landings. If the "14 in (mod35)" module is not researched, most maps the Renzan is placed on feature smaller targets like tanks, pillboxes, or destroyers. These can be dispatched with the other bomb load outs the G8N1 possesses. In Arcade battles, the strategy is exactly the same. One may also consider climbing high or flanking to avoid enemy fighters.
