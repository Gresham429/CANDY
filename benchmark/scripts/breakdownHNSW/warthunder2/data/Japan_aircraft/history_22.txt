History of Ki-27_otsu_Tachiarai: 
The Nakajima Ki-27 otsu began as the Ki-11, a competitor for the Kawasaki Ki-10 biplane. While faster and more modern than the Ki-10 biplane, the Ki-11 wasn't adopted because the Imperial Japanese Army valued manoeuvrability over speed. Nakajima continued development of the design before finalising the Ki-12, a modern monoplane with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable landing gear, but the Army denied it outright as too maintenance heavy for forward airbases in Manchuria and China. The redesigned plane instead featured a radial air-cooled engine, fixed landing gear and fully enclosed cockpit and received the designation Ki-27.
