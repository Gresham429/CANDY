History of A6M3_mod._22: 
The A6M3 Reisen mod. 22 was actually developed before the A6M3 Reisen. Due to the demand for a squared wing version the aircraft's production was delayed. The IJNAF needed a solution to the loss of range by the A6M3 Reisen. The Sakae 21 engine was kept and the aircraft's fuel was increased by 24 gallons. The mod. 22 had the greatest range of the variants. It arrived in time for Guadalcanal in August of 1942.
