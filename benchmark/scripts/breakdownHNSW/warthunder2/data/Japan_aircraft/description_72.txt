Description of A6M5_otsu: 
The A6M5 mod. 52 Otsu, designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 52B (零式艦上戦闘機五二型乙), is the second minor modification of the A6M5. The Model 52B (Otsu) retains the belt-fed 20 mm Type 99 mod.2 mark 4 from the Model 52A (Kō) with 125 rounds per gun rather than 100, but comes with an additional 13.2 mm Type 3 machine gun in exchange for a single 7.7 mm machine gun. Other additions to the Model 52B include 45 mm thick armoured glass to the windscreen, a larger propeller spinner, and a revised gas outlet near the windscreen.
