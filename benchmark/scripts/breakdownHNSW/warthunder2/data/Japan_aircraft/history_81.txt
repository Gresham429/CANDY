History of Ki-84_hei: 
The IJAAF approached Nakajima in 1942 to upgrade it's Ki 43 fighter. They realised the need for a more solidly armoured, faster, and heavier armed fighter. Addressing the common complaints with the Ki 43 which were low speed, lack of armour, and measly armament, the designers at Nakajima unleashed the Ki 84 - Japan's fastest propeller-driven fighter. Using the firm's own Homare, the Ki 84 was easily able to keep up and dogfight with the P-51 and P-47. The Hayate was produced in three modifications which happened to be the same aircraft with different armament options. These three are available to fly in-game.
