Usage of J2M3: 
Featuring two 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannons and two 20 mm Type 99 Model 2 cannons with plenty of ammunition, the J2M3 is capable of destroying all kinds of aircraft. Although destroying heavy bombers like the B-29 Superfortress takes a lot of ammunition, the J2M3 can afford to lose some. The "Stealth" belt has the best combination of AP/API and HEF to shred enemy aircraft and are recommended for those who do not need a tracer shell to aim. Alternatively, for those not used to IJN 20 mm cannons, the "Universal" belt is your best bet. The "Tracers" belt is filled with HEF-T shells, but they only contain half of the power of a standard HEF, and can give away your position.
