History of T-2: 
Soon after WW2, Japan was mostly offered jet fighter aircraft from the USAAF / USAF, such as the later versions of the F-86 Sabre, to protect itself from threats such as North Korea, which was at the time in conflict with the United States (in the 1950s). In the late '50s and '60s, Japan had already developed its first modern jet-aircraft, the Fuji T-1, which was mainly used as a trainer aircraft. But by the '70s, it was obsolete; Japan needed a new trainer aircraft, which could train pilots for near Mach 2 speeds.
