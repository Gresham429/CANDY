Description of A6M5: 
The A6M5 mod. 52, designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 52 (零式艦上戦闘機五二型), was the last main-production variant of the A6M series. The wings were redesigned once again, cutting to the same length as that of the A6M3 mod. 32 but rounding out the tips. Aside from that, the engine performance was improved due to the modification of the Sakae engine's exhaust system to point the stacks aft and distributing them around the forward fuselage, providing an additional increase in thrust. Armour protection for the pilot and fuel tanks was increased, and self-sealing fuel tanks were included in later production. The A6M5 mod. 52 retained the armament of the A6M3 mod. 22A (Ko) which fielded the better Type 99 Model 2 (20 mm) over earlier A6Ms.
