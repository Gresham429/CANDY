Description of Ki-83: 
In May of 1943, a specification was sent out by the IJAAS (Imperial Japanese Army Air Service) for a long-range heavy fighter. Tomio Kubo, the designer of the successful Ki-46, and his team took the task of building a plane to meet this specification. Work on the Ki-83 began shortly after the failure of the single-engine Ki-73. The Ki-83 would have two turbocharged 18-cylinder engines each producing a sufficient 2,200 hp. The Japanese conducted test flights with four prototypes during late 1944 and early 1945, however, the bombing campaigns hampered the program. In testing, the Ki-83's sleek airframe and powerful engines could reach an impressive 32,000 feet (9,753 meters) in under 10 minutes. However, continued struggles with logistics and supplies severely hampered the Japanese war effort and the Ki-83 program as a whole. Three prototypes were reportedly destroyed and the last one was seized by America. After a performance evaluation was conducted by the U.S., it was last seen at what is now called O'Hare Airport and was unfortunately most likely scrapped.
