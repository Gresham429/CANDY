Usage of H6K4: 
The H6K4 is an interesting aircraft to fly in air battles, given its massive size, decent defensive armament and ordnance load. The aircraft can be used as a conventional bomber in Air battles, delivering its large payload on bases. It can also be used in naval battles, with its large load of two torpedoes and the ability to cap bases. However, no matter what way you play this aircraft, be aware that it is huge. The large size of the aircraft makes it an attractive target for fighters, SPAAs and naval AA guns alike.
