Usage of Ki-84_otsu: 
The "Otsu" modification is the middle child of the Ki-84 family, dropping the 12.7 mm heavy machine guns from the previous model in favour of two additional Ho-5 20 mm cannons, boosting firepower considerably. It retains the same strengths and weaknesses of said previous model. Equipped with a 2,000 HP engine, this aircraft's performance is on par with that of the legendary P-51 Mustang. However, unlike the Mustang, the Ki-84 has solid turning characteristics and excellent climb rate thanks to its lighter weight. This being said, the Ki-84 also has good energy retention, so try to make your opponent bleed energy to have an edge. The Ki-84 was also one of the first mass-produced Japanese aircraft to come equipped with armoured glass, armour plates and self-sealing fuel tanks, but the armour is still lacklustre compared to its Russian and American counterparts. However, as always, not everything is perfect. The aircraft controls stiffen significantly at speeds above 630 km/h, making even slight adjustments to heading impossible. Thus, at higher speeds, its elevator suffers. The Ki-84 also suffers a lot when no modules are researched, making the aircraft almost useless until modifications are unlocked.
