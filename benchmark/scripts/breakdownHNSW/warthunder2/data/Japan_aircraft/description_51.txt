Description of A6M3_mod._22: 
The A6M3 mod. 22, designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 22 (零式艦上戦闘機二二型), was a modification of the A6M3 mod. 32 that aimed to address its shortcomings. It restored the wings of the A6M2 mod. 21, which had full-sized ailerons and folding wing tips, and compensated for the reduced main fuel tank size by adding extra fuel tanks to the outer wings. This improved its long-range performance. The 20 mm cannon 100-round drum magazines and the upgraded engine from the Model 32 were kept, as the Sakae 21 became the standard engine for the A6M series. The Model 22 entered service in late 1942 and participated in the Solomon Islands campaign and the New Guinea campaign. It had an advantage over the Allied fighters such as the P-40 Warhawk and the F4F Wildcat, but faced stiff competition from the newer F6F Hellcat and the P-38 Lightning. A total of 560 A6M3 Model 22s were produced between December 1942 and summer of 1943, before being replaced by the A6M5 Model 52.
