History of F-16AJ: 
Historically, the JASDF was not a user of the F-16 series (though USINDOPACOM operates the F-16C in Japanese airbases). In the 1970s, the Japanese government was seeking to replace its outdated fleet of F-104J Starfighters in response to advances in the aircraft technology of neighbouring countries. As such, they launched a program and eventually got 13 proposals from different aircraft companies, including the Grumman F-14, McDonnell Douglas F-15, and General Dynamics F-16. After much consideration and testing, the program was narrowed down to just the F-14, F-15, and F-16. Discussion and flight tests continued and the F-15 prevailed as the winner of the competition, shattering any hopes for the F-16AJ, and ultimately any F-16 to see service with the JASDF.
