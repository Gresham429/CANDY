History of G4M1: 
Designed as a lightweight medium bomber, the G4M1 sacrificed protection in order to achieve high-speed and an operational range of 2,850 km. Unfortunately, this made the plane extremely vulnerable to Allied fighters and anti-aircraft fire who found the engines and fuel tanks particularly flammable. The plane's finest hour was the sinking of the HMS Repulse and HMS Prince Of Wales, the first two capital ships sunk in open waters by aircraft during wartime.
