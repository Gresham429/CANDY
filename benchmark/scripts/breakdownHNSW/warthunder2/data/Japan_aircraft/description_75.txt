Description of N1K1-Ja: 
The N1K1-Ja, designated as Shiden Mod.11 Ko (紫電一一型甲), was the result of Kawanishi's adaptation of the canceled N1K1 floatplane project into a land-based fighter by replacing the floats with conventional landing gear. To improve the performance of the Shiden, Kawanishi swapped the original Mitsubishi Kasei 13 engine with the more powerful Nakajima Homare series, initially using the Homare 11 and later choosing the Homare 21 for mass production. The Shiden was a formidable opponent for Allied fighters over the Pacific and was the first land-based fighter designed by Kawanishi, a company specializing in floatplanes. The Shiden was quickly deployed and became the most feared Japanese fighter of the war.
