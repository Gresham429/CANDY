Description of J2M5_30mm: 
The J2M5 Model 33 (30 mm), designated as Raiden Mod.33 (Prototype) (雷電三三型 (原型)), is a prototype of the J2M5 replacing the four 20 mm cannons with two 30 mm Type 5 cannons. Due to lack of material and manpower, as well as constant bombing, it never entered production lines.
