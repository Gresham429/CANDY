Usage of Bf_109_E-7_(Japan): 
Unlike its Emil variant predecessors, the Bf 109 E-7 has improved its flying characteristics, while packing the MG FF/M at its wings for maximum damage output. Respectable rate of climb and energy retention due its power-to-weight ratio allow the Bf 109 E-7 to perform BnZ tactics, however due to the limited ammo of the MG FF/M cannons, this role may be better left to more suitable aircraft, such as the Fw 190s. Instead, Bf 109 E-7 excels at energy fighting, capable of bleeding opponents of energy and quickly striking them down. Bf 109 E-7 has good manoeuvrability, and combined with strong flaps can deal with anyone trying to dogfight you. The Air targets belt for your MG FF/M is undoubtedly effective for most aircraft, while universal ammo for your MG 17 provides AI and AP-I rounds which are capable of setting aflame vital part of your opponents.
