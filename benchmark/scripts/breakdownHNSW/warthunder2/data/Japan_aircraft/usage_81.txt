Usage of Ki-84_hei: 
The Hei Hayate is the same great Hayate but with 2 x 30 mm cannons instead of 2 x 20 mm. Although this might not seem too important, one hit from a 30 mm high explosive shell will easily send your enemies to their doom. This solves the problem of the lacklustre 20 mm cannons. When up-tiered to jets, focus on taking out propeller-powered aircraft. Climb high, and gradually work your way down. Once all the props are down, look for furballs and/or ground-pounding jets. Swoop down on these people and destroy them. When jumped by a jet, there are a few things you can do such as pulling evasive manoeuvres and wearing the enemy's energy down. Call out for your jet teammates to help you out. When there is one more person running away, unless they are a bomber (which are typically easy to catch) or a prop fighter, will not be much for you to do. Just go to the airfield, repair, and "J"-out. Equip ground target rounds and bombs and try to wear down the tickets. Remember not to die. Survival is more important than ever in the Hei Hayate: your astounding repair cost means that you need to take down at least three air targets before breaking even.
