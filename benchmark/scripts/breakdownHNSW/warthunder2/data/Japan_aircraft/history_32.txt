History of Ki-102_otsu: 
By 1943, the Japanese Army decided the Ki-102 was to be developed as a further advancement on the Ki-96, which in turn was a high-altitude prototype advancement of the Ki-45 (Family). The initial 2 planned roles for the Ki-102 were to be the Ki-102a (Ko) as a high-altitude heavy fighter and the latter as a ground-attack variant under the designation Ki-102b (Otsu).
