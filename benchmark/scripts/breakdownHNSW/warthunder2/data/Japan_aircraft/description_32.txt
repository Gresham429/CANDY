Description of Ki-102_otsu: 
The Ki-102 otsu, designated (by personnel) as Type 4 Assault Aircraft (四式襲撃機) was a Japanese twin-engine, two-seat, ground-attack aircraft that entered service in 1944. It was the main variant of the Ki-102, which was itself derived from the Ki-45. The Ki-102 otsu had a 57 mm cannon in the nose, two 20 mm cannons in the belly, and a 12.7 mm machine gun in the rear. It was designed to attack enemy ground targets with its powerful armament. The Ki-102 otsu saw limited action in the Okinawa campaign but was mostly kept in reserve to defend Japan from the expected Allied invasion.
