Usage of A6M5_otsu: 
Similar to past "Zeroes" the A6M5 otsu is a proficient dogfighter. With a turn time rivalling biplanes this aircraft is more than capable of winning any standard turning fight. It encounters problems at both high speeds and high altitudes, where its foes excel at. Generally speaking, the A6M5 otsu is best utilized as a low-altitude low-speed dogfighter. It can be a great addition to a team especially if paired with higher speed Japanese aircraft such as the Ki-61 or J2M3. When flying the A6M5 otsu, remember to keep your speed low and to never engage in head-on attacks. Although the aircraft has a 45 mm armoured glass plate in the windscreen, its main armament is not centrally located in the nose and thus will be at a significant disadvantage. "Bait" enemies by making them think they have a successful shot on you and then dart away to a lower altitude. This will most often result in either kind of scissors or a standard turn fight, where the A6M5 otsu excels. Once able to be destroyed, get as close as possible to the enemy aircraft and fire in short bursts. This way, ammunition will be conserved and the enemy surely destroyed. Be careful not to go too fast, as the A6M5 otsu's control surfaces lock up making it incredibly difficult to manoeuvre.
