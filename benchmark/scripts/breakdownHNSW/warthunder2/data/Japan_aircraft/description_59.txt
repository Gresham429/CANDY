Description of J2M2: 
The J2M2 Model 11, designated as Raiden Mod.11 (雷電一一型), was the first production model of the J2M 'Raiden' family. It was developed as a land-based defense interceptor to protect Japanese Navy bases from (high-altitude) bombers. The Navy requested this project in 1939, but only Mitsubishi responded and assigned Jiro Horikoshi and his team to work on it after the A6M production was secured. The first prototypes of the J2M were built in 1942, but it faced several technical issues, such as excessive engine vibrations and unreliable landing gear, which delayed its development and production. The Navy had high expectations for the J2M, considering it a potential replacement for the A6M, but due to its troubled development and production, the Raiden was only used as a stop-gap interceptor with limited success until the more promising N1K-J 'Shiden' was available.
