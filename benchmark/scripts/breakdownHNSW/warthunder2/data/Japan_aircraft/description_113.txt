Description of F-4EJ_Kai_Phantom_II: 
The F-4EJ Kai Phantom II (known as F-4EJæ”¹) was one of the cornerstone of the JASDF based on previous F-4EJs manufactured in Japan; as the airframe and avionics started to become obsolete by early 1980s, MHI and JASDF planned for the upgrades for the fleet of Phantoms with new controls, navigation systems and pulse-doppler radar. After the budget was passed, 90 of these jets were then converted into F-4EJ Kai standards and served JASDF for the next 3 decades until their ultimate decommission in 2021 from ADTW of JASDF.
