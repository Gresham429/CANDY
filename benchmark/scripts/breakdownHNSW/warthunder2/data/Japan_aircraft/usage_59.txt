Usage of J2M2: 
In the start of a match, you'll want to use your best advantage, climbing. The J2M2 has an incredible rate of climb for its BR. This will almost always guarantee you an altitude advantage, and from there, you should pick out your targets one-by-one. The J2M2 does not have the best offensive guns so make sure to never head-on. If you are diving on an opponent and they are trying to head-on, break off and do a spiral climb. Your opponent (if he's greedy enough) will stay on you and lose all of his energy. Once you see him about to go into a stall, quickly dive down to him and shoot him down.  Another advantage of the J2M2 is the top speed. The J2M2 can go very fast for its BR and you should use it to your advantage. One way you can use this is by doing Boom n' Zooms, but make sure to watch your speed. You don't want to go too fast to where you'll start to "lock-up" and have almost no authority of the controls.
