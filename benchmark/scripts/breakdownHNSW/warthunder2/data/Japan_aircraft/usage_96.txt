Usage of Ki-94-II: 
The Tachikawa Ki-94-II should be used as a Boom & Zoomer and a Boom & Runner depending on the situation. The Ki-94-II should be above all enemy aircraft in order to Boom & Zoom. When used as a Boom & Zoomer, set the throttle to 20%-50%. The reason behind that is the Ki-94-II's engine response to throttle change from 0% to 100% or WEP is poor, it takes 5 seconds or more for the engine to go back to full power which can be a leave the plane really vulnerable if you're trying to climbing back to altitude without engine power. If you meet players at your height, that's when Boom & Run comes into place. After going head-on with them (if you do), do not turn back to them. Level your plane out and keep flying straight to gain speed and keep doing that until the enemy pilot turns away. After that, climb more then resume Boom & Zoom.
