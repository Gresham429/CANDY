History of Bf_109_E-7_(Japan): 
From January to June 1941, a military atach√© was sent to Germany and Italy as part of the Axis industrial cooperation. During this time, General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Imperial Army got interested in the Bf 109 during a demonstration flight at the Messerschmitt factory in Regensburg and decided to buy and import five Bf 109 E-7s for trials and testing.
