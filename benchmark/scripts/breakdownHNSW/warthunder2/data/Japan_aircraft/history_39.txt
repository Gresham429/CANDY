History of H8K2: 
Widely recognized as the best maritime combat aircraft of WWII, the H8K2 was the main production model of the H8K series of bombers, making up 112 of the 167 total H8Ks of all variants. In 1938, just as its predecessor, the H6K, was entering service, the Imperial Navy ordered the development of a larger aircraft with longer range suited for solo bombing and patrol missions. The resulting H8K flying boats, entering service in February 1942, performed well until the end of the war, and were respected by allied pilots for their fearsome defensive armament. After the war, an H8K2 (one of only four which survived the war) was captured by American forces, and was eventually returned to Japan in 1979, where it remains on display to this day.
