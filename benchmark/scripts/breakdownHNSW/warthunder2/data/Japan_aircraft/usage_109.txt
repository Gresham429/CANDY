Usage of T-2_Early: 
This aircraft doesn't have any countermeasures (like flares, RWR). Any aircraft with air-to-air missiles will pose a threat to you. Although you can use rockets instead of flares, their effect is very limited. Moreover, the T-2 has no IRST system. Any plane with SARH missiles will pose a threat to you (F-4C, MiG-21, F-8E). Unless you see the other side firing missiles at you, you will not be able to detect the launch before being hit.
Offensively, the damage caused by the JM61A1 gun is seriously insufficient. The gun's shooting axis is off centre, near the lower left position.
