Usage of B7A2: 
The Ryusei is best utilized as a multi-role aircraft, similar to the role the Ju 87 D-5 plays. Once its payload is dropped, the B7A2 becomes a low altitude, low-speed dogfighter similar to an A6M. In realistic battles, the B7A2 is often paired with aircraft such as the A6M3, A6M3 mod. 22, and A6M3 mod. 22Ko. If unable to shake an enemy off your tail, these "Zeroes" can be relied on as they have impressive low altitude capabilities.
