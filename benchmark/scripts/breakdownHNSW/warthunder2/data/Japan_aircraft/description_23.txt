Description of A6M2-N: 
The A6M2-N, designated as Type 2 Seaplane fighter (二式水上戦闘機), was as a stop-gap solution for the slow development of the N1K1, this A6M is the result of taking the A6M2 mod. 11, modifying the tail, and adding 3 floats, with the center pontoon containing an additional fuel tank. While intended as an offensive measure for the Japanese island hopping campaign, it came too late to be used in its initial role but was continued to be used due to not requiring airfield infrastructure to operate, and used in patrol and defensive roles.
