Description of F-16AJ: 
The F-16AJ Fighting Falcon represents the proposed introduction of an F-16 closely resembling a YF-16 into JASDF service, as suggested by General Dynamics. The JASDF had plans to select a winner from 13 candidates proposed by different aircraft companies as part of a program to replace its ageing fleet of F-104Js and to serve alongside their F-4EJ aircraft. Ultimately, the program came down to a choice between the F-14, F-15, and F-16 where the F-15 emerged as the victor, becoming the F-15J.
