History of N1K1: 
With the start of the Sino-Japanese war, the navy required a new line of planes for the southern expansion. One of these required planes by the navy was a fighter seaplane. Before World War I, it was not uncommon for seaplanes to play a central role in combat missions, but closing into World War II seaplanes were usually only used for observation and reconnaissance missions.
