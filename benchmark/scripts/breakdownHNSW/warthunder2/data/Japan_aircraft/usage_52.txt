Usage of A6M3_mod._22Ko: 
The Zero is a extremely effective dogfighter with a very tight turn. Head on engagements should not be taken with any plane, especially Americans such as the F6F and the P-51, as the Zero is very fragile. Any hit can be lethal. The engine is very weak and fuel tanks can easily catch ablaze. At the start of the match, try climbing to be able to dive on unaware opponents. The plane can exceed 700 km/h allowing it to commit to very steep or long dives with slight stiffening. The biggest threats to the plane are American planes due to their potent and numerous guns, but any plane can be taken in a turn-fight victoriously.
