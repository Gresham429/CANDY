History of Ki-83: 
The Mitsubishi Ki-83 was an experimental heavy fighter designed near the end of WWII. Though it failed to reach production status, four prototypes were built. The aircraft was designed in response to a requirement for a new heavy fighter. The design team, led by lead designer Tomio Kubo, had previously worked on the Ki-46 'Dinah' twin-engined reconnaissance aircraft.
