Description of A6M2_mod._11: 
The A6M2 mod. 11, designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 11 (零式艦上戦闘機一一型), was the pre-production model of the A6M series and was designed for combat evaluation over China. It differed from the later variants of the A6M in that it was not adapted for carrier operations; it lacked a tail hook, foldable wing tips, and the ability to carry external fuel tanks. The Navy was so impressed by the performance of the A6M1/2 prototypes that they ordered 15 units to be sent to China before official testing was completed. The A6M made its combat debut over China, where 13 A6M's shot down 27 Soviet-built I-15s and I-16s in three minutes without any losses, demonstrating the A6M's superiority over these aircraft. Once reports reached Navy HQ, they quickly authorized the mass production of the A6M as the A6M2 mod. 21.
