Description of G4M1: 
The G4M, designated as the Type 1 Attack Bomber (一式陸上攻撃機), was a Japanese bomber that improved on the previous G3M model. It had high performance and long range, but it sacrificed armour and crew protection to reduce weight. This made it vulnerable to enemy fire and earned it the nickname "flying lighter". Despite its flaws, it was the most widely used and most famous bomber by Japan in World War II. It participated in many battles and missions, such as the sinking of the British battleships HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse in 1941, and the bombing of Darwin in 1942.
