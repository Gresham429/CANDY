Description of B-17E_(Japan): 
The ▅B-17E Flying Fortress, most likely B-17E 41-2471, was one of the few B-17 (D/E) Flying Fortresses that the Japanese captured during World War II, mostly from the Philippines and Java. They repaired and tested some of them. The crew of the B-17E 41-2471, which belonged to the 7th Bomb Group of the USAAF, abandoned it after a crash landing on February 8, 1942, at Djokjakarta, Java. The Japanese found it mostly intact and repaired it with parts from other damaged B-17Es. They flew it to Tachikawa Airfield near Tokyo, where they used it for research and training purposes. The B-17's final fate is unknown, but it was probably destroyed by Allied bombing raids or scrapped after the war.
