Usage of B7A2_(Homare_23): 
The Ryusei is best utilized as a multi-role aircraft, similar to the role the Ju 87 D-5 plays. Once its payload is dropped, the B7A2 becomes a low-altitude dogfighter similar to an A6M, packing deadly 20 mm cannons with a very manoeuvrable airframe and on top of that a stronger engine.
