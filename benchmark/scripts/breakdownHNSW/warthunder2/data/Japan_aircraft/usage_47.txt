Usage of F4U-1A_(Japan): 
Players should side climb in this plane and once at altitude, begin to dive down on enemies below. Due to the weight and aerodynamics of this aircraft, it is a fantastic Boom & Zoomer for the battle rating. With enough energy, no other comparable aircraft can catch it in a dive. When you have speed at your disposal, you can easily energy fight against higher-rank aircraft. Be aware that over speeds of approximately 550km/h the rudder is almost useless and if the target evades you it will be almost impossible to hit them. Using the aircraft's great flaps and energy retention allow the fighter to hang in the vertical much longer than other planes; it's here you can corner enemies into an energy trap. However, those who wish to take on the ▅F4U-1A Corsair in combat must make sure they go into the engagement with a significant energy advantage over your opponent or you may find yourself on the receiving end of a lead shower.
