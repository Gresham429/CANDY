Usage of Ki-45_hei: 
This variant of the Ki-45, the Ki-45 hei, features virtually the same armament as the Ki-45 otsu. Wielding one Ho-3 20 mm cannon and one Ho-203 37 mm cannon, the Ki-45 hei is the pinnacle of a multi-purpose aircraft. Its 37 mm cannon allows it to take down bombers with ease, and its single 20 mm cannon allows for some flexibility in the dog-fighting department. Although deadly, the 37 mm cannon only holds 15 rounds, so shot placement is crucial. The round itself also travels fairly slowly in the air, making it hard to hit fast moving enemy fighters. The 20 mm cannon is best used in an anti-fighter role. Unfortunately, the Ki-45's ground attack role is minimal due to the inability to equip armour piercing rounds for the 37 mm cannon. The Ki-45 hei is also unable to equip bombs.
