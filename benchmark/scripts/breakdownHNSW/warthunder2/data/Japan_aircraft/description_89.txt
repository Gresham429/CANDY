Description of J2M4_Kai: 
The J2M4 Model 32, designated as Raiden Mod.32 (雷電三二型), was a high-altitude prototype variant of the Raiden series developed to increase the service ceiling and effectiveness at high altitude. It was equipped with a Mitsubishi MK4R-C "Kasei 23C" engine and turbocharger, which lengthened the nose of the plane considerably. With 2 prototypes built, problems with the turbocharger, weight balance, and increased take-off and landing range canceled further development of a Raiden with the Kasei 23C.
