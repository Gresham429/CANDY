Usage of R2Y2_Kai_V1: 
The R2Y2 is best utilized as a medium-altitude fighter in all game modes. Due to its lacklustre acceleration, like many jets, gaining airspeed as early as possible is crucial. Once the R2Y2 pilot loses his or her speed, they are easy prey for faster-accelerating propeller aircraft. It is important to always have a high speed when attacking enemies as otherwise they will often be able to slot in on your tail in a matter of seconds. This short time can be a matter of life or death as many fast-turning propeller aircraft such as the Spitfire wield impressive armaments with high burst masses. However, these advantages can be nullified once the R2Y2 pilot has the ability to dive away at high speeds.
