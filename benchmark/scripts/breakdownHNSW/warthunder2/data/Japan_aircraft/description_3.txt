Description of Ki-10-I: 
The Ki-10-I, designated as Type 95 Fighter (九五式戦闘機), was a biplane fighter aircraft developed by Kawasaki for the Imperial Japanese Army in the mid-1930s. It was designed by Takeo Doi, who had succeeded the German Richard Vogt as chief designer for Kawasaki. The Ki-10 was the winner of the contract against Nakajima's Ki-11, a low-wing monoplane, as the Army preferred the more manoeuvrable biplane. The Ki-10 had a metal structure covered with fabric, a liquid-cooled V-12 engine, and two 7.7 mm machine guns. The Ki-10 entered service in 1937 and saw combat in Manchukuo, North China, and Southeast Asia during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the early stages of World War II. It was the last biplane fighter used by the Japanese Army, and was gradually replaced by more advanced monoplane fighters such as the Ki-27, Ki-43, and Ki-44.
