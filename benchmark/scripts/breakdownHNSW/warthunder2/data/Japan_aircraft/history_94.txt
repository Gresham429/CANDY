History of Fw_190_A-5_(Japan): 
In 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service imported one Fw 190 A-5 from Germany,[1] which was delivered via submarine. The Fw 190 A-5 model was tested at the Fussa airfield, the Imperial Japanese Army's central testing facility for aircraft. The plane was flown by Lieutenant Commander Aramaki Yoshitsugu, who found the Fw 190 cockpit size just right as opposed to the tightness of the Bf 109 or the spaciousness of a P-40.[2]
