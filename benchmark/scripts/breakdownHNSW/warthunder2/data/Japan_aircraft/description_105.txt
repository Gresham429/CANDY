Description of F-86F-40_JASDF_(Japan): 
Considered one of the premier fighter aircraft of the day, several nations put bids in to receive surplus F-86 fighters to add to their arsenal. Japan successfully acquired this aircraft, however, due to the popularity of the aircraft, supplies evaporated. Though North American Aviation restarted production of the aircraft, Japan successfully lobbied to acquire the licensing rights to have Mitsubishi begin production of the aircraft, allowing Japan to increase its air force's offensive and defensive capabilities sooner than expected.
