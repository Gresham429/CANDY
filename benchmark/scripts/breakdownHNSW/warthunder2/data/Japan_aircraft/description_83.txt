Description of J2M3: 
The J2M3 Model 21, designated as Raiden Mod.21 (雷電二一型), was an uparmed variant of the previous J2M2 by replacing the nose-mounted machine guns with two Type 99 Model 1 20 mm cannons in the wings. It also used belt feeds instead of drum magazines for both Model 1 and Model 2 cannons resulting in greater ammunition capacity. The J2M3 was the most widely produced variant of the Raiden series.
