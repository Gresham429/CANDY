Description of Ki-94-II: 
The Ki-94-II was a single-seat, piston-engine fighter designed by Tachikawa Aircraft Company for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. It was intended to intercept high-altitude B-29 bombers with a pressurized cockpit and four wing-mounted autocannons. The project started in 1943 as a revised version of the earlier Ki-94-I, which was a twin-boom push-pull design that was rejected as too complex. The Ki-94-II had a powerful Nakajima Ha-219 (Ha-44) engine and a six-blade propeller, but it never flew before the end of World War II. Only two prototypes were built, one of which was still being prepared for its maiden flight when the war ended with a four-blade propeller.
