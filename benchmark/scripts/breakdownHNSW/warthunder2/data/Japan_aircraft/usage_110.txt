Usage of F-4EJ_Phantom_II: 
The F-4EJ Phantom II is best described as a mixed bag. It is a potent fighter-bomber, capable of carrying x24 500lb bombs along with a full payload of Sparrows and Sidewinders. This means that, with some luck, the F-4EJ Phantom destroy two bases before circling around to engage the enemy in their unguarded flanks. However, this is not advisable and largely depends on luck, as you will likely be swamped by masses of low-flying aircraft who will have no issues completely outperforming you with a full bomb load. The ideal role for the F-4EJ is as a high-altitude Interceptor, being faster and more well-armed than many aircraft that will be up there with you. In a downtier, climbing at around 20-30Â° (depending on whether you want to be faster or more well-positioned) to a height of 5kms or higher generally means that your Sparrows, with better performance, will often be able to take out high-flying aircraft with impunity. It can hold its own against some opponents, but generally avoid a turnfight with the generally accepted threats such as F-5Cs and Drakens and most Mig-21s, who will have no issue dancing around your nose. While most aircraft can be beaten with careful application of airbrakes and the planes, almost any delta wing aircraft, namely the Mirage III, MiG-21 and J35D, being nigh impossible to beat. To have any chance of beating delta winged jets you must force the fight into the sustained regime where some delta winged jets flown by inexperienced pilots may struggle to rate with you.
