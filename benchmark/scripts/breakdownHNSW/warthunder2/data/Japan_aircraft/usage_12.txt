Usage of Ki-45_ko: 
The Ki-45 ko's armament is much more suited for dogfighting than its later, 37 mm cannon-armed variants. With a moderate ammunition pool, it is easily possible to destroy multiple enemies with this aircraft. It is recommended to use the 20 mm cannon only when the pilot is confident of hitting the enemy aircraft, as it only holds 100 shells. The 12.7 mm machine guns are where most of the damage will be done at range.
