History of G8N1: 
The G8N1 Renzan was designed to fit an earlier Japanese military specification of a long-range land-based attack plane. The earlier attempt, the G5N1 failed. The initial prototype was completed in October of 1944 and delivered to the Imperial Navy for testing. A total of four prototypes were produced before production stopped as a result of the cease in hostilities. The Allies allocated the name "Rita" to the G8N.
