History of F-15J: 
The F-15J Eagle, a cornerstone of Japan's air defence, represents a pivotal chapter in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's (JASDF) history. This twin-engine, all-weather air superiority fighter, a variant of the American McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, emerged from Japan's strategic need to modernize its air capabilities in the 1970s. During this period, Japan was in the process of phasing out its ageing fleet of F-104J Starfighters and F-4EJ Phantom IIs. After a thorough evaluation of various options, including the F-14 Tomcat and F-16 Fighting Falcon, the JASDF settled on the F-15 Eagle, primarily for its unmatched air superiority.
