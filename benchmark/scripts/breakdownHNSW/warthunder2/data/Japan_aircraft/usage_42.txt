Usage of Ki-48-II_otsu: 
The Ki-48-II Otsu can be used as a frontline bomber in Air Battles, owing to its high top speed, its exceptional manoeuvrability (for a bomber), and its small profile. It is able to quickly deliver ordnance to frontline units and dispatch them with ease. However, enemy fighters will make short work of you if they are faster, so it is advisable to flee the area as soon as all ordnance is spent.
