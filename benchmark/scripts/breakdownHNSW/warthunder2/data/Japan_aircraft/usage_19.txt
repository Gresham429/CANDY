Usage of Ki-21-Ia: 
If attacked by fighters, it is important to remember and recognize the Ki-21's turning capabilities. It is actually possible to win lateral turn fights against fighters with this aircraft as she is one of the most manoeuvrable bombers if not the most manoeuvrable bomber in game. While the Ki-21's defensive firepower isn't going to deter enemies from attacking, they still can damage enemy planes.
