Description of H6K4: 
The H6K4, designated as the Type 97 Large Flying Boat (九七式大型飛行艇), was a Japanese flying boat that was used for maritime patrols and bombings during World War II. The aircraft was developed in 1934 based on the experiences of Kawanishi with the British Short Brothers flying boats. It had four engines, a twin tail, and a parasol wing with floats. It made its first flight in 1936 and entered service with the Japanese navy in 1938. It had an excellent range and could patrol for 24 hours. It was deployed in the war against China and later in the war in the Pacific, where it carried out attacks on Wake Island and Australia. The aircraft was vulnerable to the newer generation of Allied fighters and was gradually replaced by the Kawanishi H8K. A total of 215 units were built.
