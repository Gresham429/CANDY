Usage of J5N1: 
Similar to the previous aircraft in its tech tree branch, the J5N1 excels at hunting down enemy bombers. The heavy armament of the J5N1 allows it tear apart even the most heavily armed aircraft it will face, and it can gain remarkable amounts of speed in a straight line over time. Compared to the Ki-108 preceding it, the J5N1 also has substantially better vertical energy retention, allowing boom and zoom to be a somewhat more viable tactic. Pilots should be wary of approaching enemy bombers from behind, as although the pilot will probably be safe due to the aircraft's frontal protection, the rest of the aircraft is quite vulnerable.
