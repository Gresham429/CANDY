Usage of G4M1: 
Comparing to its contemporaries, the G4M1 has a somewhat above average climb rate and top speed. Where it has an advantage is in the defensive armament, which, however, cannot be completely relied upon, due to the unreliability of the AI gunners and the relative fragility of the medium bombers.
