Description of N1K2-J: 
The N1K2-J, designated as Shiden Kai Mod. 21 (紫電改二一型), was developed very shortly after the N1K1-J Shiden was accepted into service, addressing most of the flaws of the previous model. The wings were moved to a low position, which permitted the use of a shorter, conventional undercarriage. The fuselage was lengthened and the tail was redesigned. The production of the entire aircraft was simplified; it was lighter by 250 kg, faster, and more reliable than its predecessor. Although engine issues were still a problem, the Homare couldn't be replaced as there was simply no alternative.
