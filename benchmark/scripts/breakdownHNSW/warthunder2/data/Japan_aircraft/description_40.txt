Description of Ki-49-I: 
The Ki-49-IÂ Donryu is a rank II Japanese bomber 
with a battle rating of 3.3 (AB), 3.0 (RB), and 3.7 (SB). It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It is the first model of the Ki-49 family in War Thunder. It is notably fast in level flight, features excellent protection from the rear, and is fairly manoeuvrable when making use of its very large elevators. It's the first Japanese bomber to get access to any significant armour protection, and there's plenty of it to be found. Pilots will find the Ki-49 versatile in air battles because of its ability to perform low-altitude bombing as well as bomb bases. Your speed makes up for your payload since you can always make many trips to rearm.
