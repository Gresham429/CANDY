Description of Ki-108_Kai: 
The Ki-108 Kai was a Japanese twin-engine heavy fighter/interceptor prototype developed from the Ki-96 and Ki-102 models. It was designed to counter the high-altitude American bombers such as the B-29 Superfortress. It had a pressurized cockpit, a 37 mm nose cannon and two 20 mm chin cannons. It was powered by two Mitsubishi Ha-112-II Ru turbosupercharged radial engines. Only four Ki-108s were built and none saw combat before the end of the war.
