History of B6N2a_Model_12Ko: 
An excellent replacement for the Nakajima B5N in the role of on-board torpedo aircraft, the B6N Tenzan entered service very late, after more than two years of testing. Named JILL in the Allied code, this large single-engine plane appeared as a prototype in spring 1941. The first tests revealed serious steering stability problems. Subsequently, there were difficulties in developing the engine and the need to reinforce the landing gear. After 133 units of the first version of the B6N1 were built, the second production model began to be delivered towards the end of 1943. A total of 1,268 units were built.
