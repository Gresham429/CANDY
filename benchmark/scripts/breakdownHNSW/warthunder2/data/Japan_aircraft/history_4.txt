History of Ki-10-II: 
The Kawasaki Ki-10 was the last Biplane fighter used by the Japanese Army. Introduced in 1935, it beat the competing Nakajima Ki-11 (which would later be refined as the Ki-27) as the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force placed more priority on manoeuvrability than speed. Its excellent manoeuvrability made it extremely popular with Japanese pilots, who demanded similar high manoeuvrability from newer aircraft. Over the course of its service, the fighter would be refined several times with the ultimate version, the Ki-10-II, appearing in 1937.
