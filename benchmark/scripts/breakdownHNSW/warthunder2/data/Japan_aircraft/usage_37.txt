Usage of D4Y3_Ko: 
The D4Y3 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber air spawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long as you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out-turn any interceptor at that battle rating. Besides the fighter role, the ground attack is the D4Y3's natural method of play. The 500 kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your rifle-calibre machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.
