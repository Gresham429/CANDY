History of A7M1_(NK9H): 
In late 1940, right after the A6M started entering its production phase, the navy requested Mitsubishi develop a direct successor of the A6M by 1941, but due engine choice for a high-output compact engine was scarce, and the development team having their hands filled with development of the A6M2 Mod.21 and developing the J2M made Mitsubishi decide to scrap the request.
