History of J2M5: 
Nearing the end of the war, the focus of the J2Ms was shifted towards even more local interceptors as requested at a faster approach. With the J2M5, Raiden Model 33's a new and last engine revision was made, the Kasei 26a engine with a mechanically driven supercharger. This allowed the Model 33 to get higher speeds at higher altitudes compared to that of the J2M4, Model 32 at the cost of total range which was a sacrifice that was required as American bombers got closer and closer to the mainland.
