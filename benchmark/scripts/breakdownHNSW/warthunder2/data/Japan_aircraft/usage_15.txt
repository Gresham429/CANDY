Usage of B5N2: 
The B5N2 is a Japanese torpedo-bomber that is lacking in offensive armaments and is defended by a single 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun at the back, which makes it lacking in defence against enemy pursuers. Its greatest weapon is not the speed to outrun enemy fighters but its manoeuvrability and ability to do tight turns against most enemy aircraft till help arrives from the team.
