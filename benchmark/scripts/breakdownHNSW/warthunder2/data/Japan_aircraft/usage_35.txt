Usage of D4Y1: 
The D4Y1 is an excellent example of a multirole aircraft, as it is an excellent ground attack aircraft, fighter, and bomber. Since you get a bomber airspawn, you can drop your bomb on a base and then start to engage the many fighters below you. You should have no problems engaging them, as long is you keep your speed up and your energy high. One key thing to note is that you don't need to use your defensive turret to shoo away enemy interceptors. You can easily out turn any interceptor at that BR. Besides the fighter role, ground attack is the D4Y1's natural method of play. The 500 kg bomb will be excellent for destroying Pillboxes, and you can use your rifle-calibre machine guns to destroy any soft target you please.Spec
