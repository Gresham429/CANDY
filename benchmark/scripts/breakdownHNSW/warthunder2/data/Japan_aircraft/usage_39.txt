Usage of H8K2: 
The H8K2 can be thought of as a Japanese version of the German BV 238, and plays similarly. However, there are some key differences between the two aircraft. The H8K2 can be used in both Naval battles, and Air battles, though there are some key limitations. The aircraft has a strong defensive armament suite of ten guns (five 20 mm cannons and five 7.7 mm machine guns), and can also carry a pair of torpedoes. However, it is a very large aircraft, and is easily shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire. In general, the aircraft should avoid close-in, frontline combat, and instead be used as a heavy bomber/support aircraft.
