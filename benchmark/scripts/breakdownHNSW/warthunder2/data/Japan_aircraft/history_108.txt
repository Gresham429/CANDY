History of F-1: 
The Mitsubishi F-1 was an indigenously-produced Japanese supersonic fighter aircraft that served with the Japanese Air Self Defence Force (JASDF). Based on the earlier Mitsubishi T-2, the aircraft first flew in 1975 and entered service a short time later.[1] A total of 160 aircraft were initially ordered, but the order was reduced to 77 airframes due to budget constraints.[1] In service, the aircraft served as an anti-shipping platform and was intended to fire the Mitsubishi ASM-1 anti-ship missile at enemy naval vessels.[2]
