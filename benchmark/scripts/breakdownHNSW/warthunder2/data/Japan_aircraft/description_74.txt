Description of A7M2: 
The A7M2, designated as Reppū Mod. 11 (烈風一一型), was a Japanese carrier-based fighter designed by Mitsubishi as the successor to the A6M Zero. It was intended to have superior speed, climb, diving, and armament over the Zero, as well as better manoeuvrability. The development began in 1942 but faced many challenges due to engine selection and wing loading issues. The A7M2 was powered by a 2,200 hp Mitsubishi Ha-43 engine and had a maximum speed of 627 km/h. It was armed with two 20 mm cannons and two 13 mm machine guns, or four 20 mm cannons. Only nine A7M2s were built before the end of the war, and none saw active service.
