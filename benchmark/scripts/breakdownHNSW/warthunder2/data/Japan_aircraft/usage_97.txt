Usage of J6K1: 
The J6K1 can be thought of as a slightly heavier N1K2. This means your climb rate and turn rate have been nerfed somewhat. In the beginning of each battle you will need to sideclimb as the J6K's added weight makes the climb rate rather subpar against many of your opponents. It is reasonably manoeuvrable and beats every American aircraft spare the P-59A in RB, though it is not enough to out-turn highly manoeuvrable planes like the Re.2005 serie 0 or Spitfire LF Mk IX (though it will outturn the later and heavier Spitfires with clipped wings)
