History of F-86F-40_(Japan): 
Following the formal founding of the JASDF in 1954, the North American F-86F was selected as the nascent air force's day-fighter jet. Originally, the USAF expected to be able to deliver all of the JASDF's fighters from its stocks of surplus aircraft since the Sabre was slated for replacement by supersonic fighter jets. Still, with the production of the F-86F-35-NA having been wound down in August of 1954, it was soon realised that existing stocks would be insufficient to cover the orders for the Sabre made by many of the Allied nations. Additionally, negotiations between Japan and the United States resulted in a license agreement being struck, which would eventually see Mitsubishi cover the production of the F-86F for the JASDF. However, as production facilities would first have to be set up for this, the first block of F-86Fs would be delivered to the JASDF.
