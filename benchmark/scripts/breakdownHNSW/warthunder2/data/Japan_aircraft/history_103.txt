History of R2Y2_Kai_V2: 
The R2Y2 was a jet-powered version of the R2Y1 designed by Kugisho. Known as the Keiun or Keiun-Kai ("Beautiful Cloud" in Japanese) the aircraft would be a high-speed jet-bomber/attacker that could be used in the defence of the home islands of the Japanese empire. The powerplant of the jet Keiun-Kai would be a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines mounted in pods located, with one under each wing. Compared to the Version 1, the V2 features the jet's air-intakes in the wing roots and the engine in the tail-beam similar to the F9F. The major advantage of this setup is the reduced air drag resulting in both better top speed and better acceleration. With the increased height less lawn and small stones can enter the jet engines, a common problem in WW2 as most military airports were plain lawn fields. However, the big disadvantage is increased maintenance time form the far more complicated engine arrangement. Further storage places for fuel get sparse. The last version V3 would feature a nose-mounted air-intake with the engines remaining centrally mounted within the fuselage.
