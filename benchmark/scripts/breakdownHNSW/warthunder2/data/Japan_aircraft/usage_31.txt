Usage of J1N1: 
Unlike most Japanese aircraft, the J1N1 can take quite a lot of punishment. As a twin-engine fighter/interceptor/attacker, it has the ability to remain in operation even flying on only one engine and with partial wing missing. While there is no real protection for its fuel tanks, it is less likely to catch fire when compared to other Japanese aircraft at its battle rating. If playing Realistic Battles, it is battle rating is slightly higher than arcade, but its forte is really in arcade battles at its battle rating. Its bomb load is relegated to smaller bomb sizes, but at the battle rating, it is enough to take out a few ground targets. The autocannons and machine guns on the aircraft are sufficient to perform strafing runs on lightly armoured vehicles.
