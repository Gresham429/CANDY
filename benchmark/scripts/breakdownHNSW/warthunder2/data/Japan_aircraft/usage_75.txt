Usage of N1K1-Ja: 
As the first aircraft in the famed land-based N1K fighter series, the N1K1-Ja is a very interesting aircraft to fly. It will struggle to out-run or out-climb most fighters at its BR, but can make use of some nice features such as its extremely good medium-speed manoeuvrability and strong armament.
