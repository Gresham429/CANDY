Description of G5N1: 
The G5N1, designated as Shinzan (深山), was a four-engine heavy bomber developed by Nakajima for the Imperial Japanese Navy before World War II. It was based on the American Douglas DC-4E airliner, which was secretly acquired and reverse-engineered by Japan in 1939. The Shinzan was intended to have a long-range capability of 3,000 nautical miles and a payload capacity of 4,000 kg of bombs or torpedoes. However, the bomber never entered service due to its poor performance, unreliable and underpowered engines.
