Usage of G5N1: 
If the "14 in mod 35" module isn't researched, the other two bomb options can still be viable. The 24 x 60 kg bomb option can be useful on the map New Guinea because the enemy team has several cargo ships and light cruisers. Both are soft targets, and with 24 bombs it is straightforward to destroy all of them. The map Zhengzhou features dozens of light and heavy pillboxes which are also easy targets for the G5N1. The 12 x 250 kg bomb option works the best here. It is also possible to use the 60 kg bombs but requires a direct hit to destroy a light pillbox. The benefit of the 250 kg bombs is the bomber can destroy pillboxes without direct hits and may occasionally destroy a nearby AAA or artillery piece. In arcade battles, the 4 x 800 kg bomb option is the best for destroying mini bases and the enemy airfield. Utilise the different bomb options depending on what your target is. For light targets like pillboxes and tanks use either the 60 kg or 250 kg bombs, and for heavy targets like bases and airfields use 800 kg bombs.
