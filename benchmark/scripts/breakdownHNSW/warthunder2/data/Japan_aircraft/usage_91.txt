Usage of B-17E_(Japan): 
Generally, the plane's role should not diverge from this norm, as it is ineffective and costly as a low altitude bomber. Survival is an utmost importance to be remembered when using this plane. While one target may be missed, there will always be another opportunity to make another pass once reloaded and repaired. The few M2 machine guns in the nose cannot protect the most vulnerable part of any B-17 - the nose. Protected only by a layer of Plexiglas and almost no armour (excluding the frontal bulkhead, which only covers the pilot/co-pilot's torso), most of the crew critical in the success of the mission, including the pilot, co-pilot, bombardier and navigator would be knocked-out instantly. If targeted by German cannons, most notably, the Mk 108. Just a burst of 30 mm MK 108 placed anywhere on the aircraft , would compromise the crew's survival and even the aircraft's structural integrity.
