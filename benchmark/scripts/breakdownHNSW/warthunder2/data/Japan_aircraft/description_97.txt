Description of J6K1: 
The J6K1, designated as Jinpū Kai (陣風改), was a land-based interceptor that evolved from the J3K Jinpū, a cancelled fighter project that depended on the delayed Mitsubishi Ha-43 / MK9 engine. Kawanishi, the manufacturer of both models, switched to the Nakajima Ha-45 / NK9 Homare engine for the J6K1 as soon as it was available. The Imperial Japanese Navy inspected the first prototype in early 1944 and considered three possible armaments with different combinations of 13.2 mm machine guns, 20 mm cannons, and 30 mm cannons. However, the J6K1 was soon dropped in favour of the N1K-J Shiden Kai. The J6K might have been reconsidered as a heavier high-altitude interceptor in the final months of the war, but it was again rejected in favour of the proposed A7M3-J Reppu Kai.
