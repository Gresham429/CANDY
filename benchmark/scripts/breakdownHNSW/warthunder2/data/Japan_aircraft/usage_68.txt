Usage of Ki-100-II: 
Pilots of the standard Ki-100 found in the tech tree should feel relatively comfortable in the premium Ki-100-II. This aircraft offers balanced performance characteristics that allow pilots to choose how they wish to fight in the Ki-100-II and adapt to the combat situation as necessary. The performance of the Ki-100-II is characterized by decent climb rate and manoeuvrability. The aircraft has good (but not the best) acceleration in a dive that makes it suitable for short range "boom and zoom" style attacks. The pilot should position the fighter around 1000 meters above a selected target, dive rapidly, fire a quick burst, and then pull away in a shallow climb to hold the plane's speed and escape. This is the safest way to conduct combat in the Ki-100-II, but there are other options available.
