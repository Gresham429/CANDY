Description of A6M5_Ko: 
The A6M5 mod. 52 Kō, designated as the Type 0 Carrier-based Fighter Model 52A (零式艦上戦闘機五二型甲), is the first minor modification of the A6M5. The Model 52A (Kō) switches out the drum-fed Type 99 mod.2 mark 3 (20 mm) for the belt-fed Type 99 mod.2 mark 4 (20 mm), increasing the total ammo count to 250 rather than 200.
