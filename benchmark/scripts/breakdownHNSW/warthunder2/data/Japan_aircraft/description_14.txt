Description of Ki-109: 
The Ki-109 is based on the Mitsubishi Ki-67 heavy bomber, refitted as an interceptor in an attempt to counter the American high-altitude bombing raids that devastated Japan. It is armed with a 75 mm anti-aircraft gun modified for aircraft use, and almost all defensive armament from the bomber version has been stripped, except for the tail turret, to maximize performance.
