Usage of A7M2: 
The A7M2 Reppu that takes the best of the A6M and does it better also translates it in aerial combat. With its higher engine output, very similar manoeuvrability and higher rip-speeds, it can engage in all playstyles; whether the situation calls for it the A7M can either turn fight, Boom-&-Zoom, energy fight and others. Yet it is sometimes tricky to maintaining energy fights with enemies like the F6F-5, P-51, etc.
