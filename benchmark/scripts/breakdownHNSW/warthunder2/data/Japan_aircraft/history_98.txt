History of Kikka: 
The Nakajima Kikka was Japan's first entirely turbojet-powered aircraft, designed as a cheap and fast special attack plane for envisioned decisive battles in the defense of Japan. Whilst a general resemblance can be seen to the German Me 262 Schwalbe, this is only due to superficial characteristics such as the under-wing engine nacelles and roughly triangular fuselage. In terms of detailed structural design, the two are not directly related.
