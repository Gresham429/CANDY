Description of Ki-32: 
The Ki-32 was a Japanese light bomber developed in 1936 as a replacement for the Kawasaki Ki-3. The specification called for a top speed of 400 km/h at 3,000 m, ability to climb to an altitude of 3,000 m within 8 minutes, be powered by either the 825 hp Mitsubishi Ha-6 radial, 850 hp Nakajima Ha-5 radial, or 850 hp Kawasaki Ha-9-IIb liquid-cooled inline engine, and carry a maximum payload of 450 kg of bombs. Additionally, the specification also called for a single forward-firing machine gun, a rear-facing machine gun on flexible mount, and the ability to perform a 60-degree dive for dive bombing. Production ceased in 1940 with 854 built. The Ki-32 were withdrawn from front-line service in December 1941.
