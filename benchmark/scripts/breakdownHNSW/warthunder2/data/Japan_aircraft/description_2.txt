Description of A5M4: 
The A5M, designated as the Type 96 Carrier-based Fighter (九六式艦上戦闘機), was the world's first carrier-borne monoplane, developed by Mitsubishi for the IJNAS in 1934 and adopted in 1936. Being a marvel of early aviation, the A5M, which started out as company designation Ka-14, was a creation of Jiro Horikoshi and his team (the designer that would later develop the famous A6M 'Zero'). Serving the Navy well during the Second Sino-Japanese War, it took part in the world's first aerial skirmishes between monoplane fighters built of mostly metal against Chinese P-26 'Peashooters', where it outperformed the Chinese aerial units by manoeuvrability and robust construction. This early workhorse of the Imperial Navy Air Service was highly favoured by its aircrews and fared well in battle. By 1938, the main rival of the A5M would become the fast and heavily armed Polikarpov I-16 flown by both Chinese pilots and Soviet volunteers.
