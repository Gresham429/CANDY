Description of Ki-67-I_otsu: 
The Ki-67-I otsu, designated as Type 4 Heavy Bomber Model 1B (四式重爆撃機甲), was the later main production variant of the Ki-67 with enhanced rear defensive firepower, which was designed to replace the Ki-49 and to be suitable for possible operations over the Manchurian-Siberia border. It was designed to be one of the most survivable and damage-resistant Japanese aircraft of the war, with self-sealing fuel tanks, armour and it was also highly manoeuvrable and capable of dive-bombing attacks. It entered service in October 1944 and was used in various roles, including conventional bombing and anti-shipping. With the Ki-67 being a very capable medium bomber platform, it was remodeled and modified for other special purposes, with projects ranging from simple bomb-role upgrades, interceptor (Ki-109), bomber escort, etc.. However, due to Allied bombing raids and production delays, only 767 Ki-67s were built before the end of the war.
