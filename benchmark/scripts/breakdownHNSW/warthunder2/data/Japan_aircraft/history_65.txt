History of G5N1: 
This aircraft was designed off of the Douglas DC-4E. It was Japan's first take on a four-engine heavy bomber design, and the DC-4E was first shipped to Japan's Nippon Koku K.K. aircraft corporation. After that, it was sent in secret to the Nakajima Aircraft Company for inspection. Having only six prototypes built, the G5N Shinzan saw no combat. The Allies assuming this aircraft to be a bomber, they utilised the name "Liz".
