Japan successfully acquired this aircraft. However, due to the popularity of the aircraft, supplies evaporated. Though North American restarted production of the aircraft, Japan successfully lobbied to acquire the licensing rights to have Mitsubishi Manufacturing begin production of the aircraft, allowing Japan to increase its air force's offensive and defensive capabilities sooner than expected.
