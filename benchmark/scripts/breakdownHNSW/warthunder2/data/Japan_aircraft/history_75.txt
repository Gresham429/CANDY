History of N1K1-Ja: 
In late 1941, as the 15-shi was still in development, some engineers were already concerned and proposed it would also be the basis of a formidable land-based fighter and a land-based version was produced as a private venture by the company. This version flew on 27 December 1942 powered by a Nakajima NK9A Homare 11 18-cylinder radial engine, replacing the less powerful Mitsubishi MK4C Kasei 13 of the N1K1.
