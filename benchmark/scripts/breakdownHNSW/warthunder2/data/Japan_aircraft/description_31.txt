Description of J1N1: 
The J1N1, a prototype in the J1N series, was initially designed in 1938 to address the Japanese Navy Air Service's need for extended range missions for bombers. This was crucial as navy fighter squadrons lacked the necessary navigation and communication capabilities for lengthy land-based bomber sorties. Due to its slow development, tests could only be conducted in 1941, when the A6M had already been proven as a very capable long-range fighter that could escort bombers with its impressive range; additionally, the manoeuvrability of the J1N1 was lacklustre, its speed and cruising range requirements were just barely met, and the two dual remote turrets were prone to reliability issues. The J1N1 did however did impress the Navy in its range, and was therefore remodeled to replace their older land-based reconnaissance aircraft and ordering it under the designation of the Type 2 Land reconnaissance plane (J1N1-C / Later J1N1-R). Later variants of the J1Ns were up-armed with oblique equipped 20 mm to shoot down bombers with, which this night-fighter variant being put in service as the Gekk≈ç (J1N1-S). The J1N also served as the template for the J5N Tenrai.
