Usage of Ki-49-IIa: 
This aircraft has the ability to hold up to 1,000 kg of bombs in several different variations. 12 x 50 kg  bombs, 4 x 250 kg bombs and 1 x 500 kg bomb. Use the 12 x 50 kg bombs to attack light tanks and light pillboxes. They are not viable against bigger targets since direct hits are needed to destroy. This loadout is particularly useful on maps like Zhengzhou where there is an abundance on non-moving targets (light pillboxes). Use the 4 x 250 kg bomb versions to destroy heavier targets such as medium tanks, pillboxes, destroyers, and cargo ships or mini bases. Use the 500 kg bomb to destroy targets like carriers.
