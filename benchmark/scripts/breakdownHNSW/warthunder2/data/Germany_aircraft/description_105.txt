Description of Fw_190_A-5/U12: 
The Fw 190 A-5 was a variant of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, a German single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft that was widely used during World War II. The Fw 190 A-5 was developed in 1942 to shift the plane's center of gravity and increase the payload capacity of the Fw 190 by moving the engine forward and allowing more weight to be carried aft.  In the course of the war, the Fw 190 A-5 was used by the Luftwaffe as a ground-attack aircraft, night fighter, fighter-bomber, and fighter in several locations, such as France, the Soviet Union, North Africa, and Britain. The Fw 190 A-5 proved to be superior to the Spitfire Mk. V at low and medium altitudes but suffered from decreased performance at high altitudes. The Fw 190 A-5 was also loaned to Japan for evaluation but was not adopted by the Japanese Army. Nonetheless, the aircraft was notable for its versatility and effectiveness, as well as its use by some of the most accomplished Luftwaffe aces during WWII. The "U-12" stands for "Umrüst-Bausatz 12", which means "conversion kit 12" in German. This was a designation for a series of field modifications that were applied to some Fw 190 A-5s to enhance their capabilities for specific missions. Specifically, the Fw 190 A-5/U12 was equipped with two underwing 20 mm MG 151/20 gunpods for air-to-air combat.
