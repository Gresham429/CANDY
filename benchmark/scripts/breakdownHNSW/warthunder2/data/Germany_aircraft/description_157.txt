Description of Su-22UM3K_(Germany): 
During the 1980s, the latest upgraded variants of the Su-17 fighter-bomber were starting to come online in the Soviet air force, and very quickly, it was exported as the Su-22 for Soviet allies. the East German air force would receive 48 of the latest Su-22M4 fighter bomber, and along with it eight of the twin-seat Su-22UM-3K trainer aircraft. The German Su-22s would serve as a frontline strike aircraft in the event of a war with NATO forces, and would remain in East German service until the re-unification of Germany, after which the almost all Su-22s were either scrapped or sold off as they were incompatible with NATO hardware and standards, with only a few being kept and repainted in German Luftwaffe liveries for serving as evaluation and testing aircraft.
