Usage of Bf_110_G-2: 
In mixed ground battles, the Bf 110 G-2 is a fantastic multipurpose plane being able to carry various bombs, additional guns, rockets or nothing, allowing it to perform both ground attack and air superiority roles. For ground pounding, the most recommended setup is 2 x 500 kg bombs with at least 1.5 seconds fuse. They are loaded on the fuselage and drop one by one, meaning that with accurate aiming, you can consistently get around 2 enemy targets easily. Dive at a target at no more than 45Â° (the elevator cannot effectively pitch the plane up in time, resulting in a crash) and gather speed up around 500 km/h (if too fast, cut the throttle). Zoom in on the target and when it is twice as big as the mouse cursor, place the target between the cursor and the cockpit, and release the bomb. For the 1 x 250 kg + 1 x 1,000 kg setup, the aiming is similar, but place the target closer to the cursor for the 250 kg, and for the 1,000 kg, closer to the cockpit. Once all bombs are out, zoom climb towards your airfield to gain altitude advantage (the average air spawn altitude seems to be around 1,000 m) and keep and eye on the enemy air spawn. Once an enemy plane spawns, you must decide if it is single-engined or twin-engined as fast as possible. You can force it to engage in a head-on, as your nose-mounted cannons are effective at this. If the opponent is single-engined, avoid turning too much and maintain your speed. If necessary, use your tail gun and put a stray of 7.92 mm bullets into it, but remember to use the Armoured targets belt to compensate for the small calibre. You can also target ground units, especially lightly armoured ones: SPAA, light tanks, and open-topped SPGs.
