History of Me_262_A-2a: 
The A-2a Sturmvogel was developed due to Hitler's continued insistence on developing the Me-262 into a fighter-bomber variant. In May 1944, after learning the fighter-bomber role had not been worked on, Hitler reaffirmed his order that such an aircraft must take precedent over the fighter variant without further delay. Any modification of the existing 262's airframe were already problematic and it forced designers at Messerschmitt to make compromises for the fighter-bomber variant. This included the removal of two of the four 30 mm cannons in the nose. This was to help offset an inherent imbalance of the airframe, especially once the payload was dropped and the weight was lifted. The Sturmvogel also received two hardpoints for carrying bombs. These changes would ultimately produce a heavier Me-262 with altered flight characteristics and experienced pilots to operate them. However by 1944, the Luftwaffe has lost air superiority over the skies of Europe and experienced pilots were coming up in short supply. Ultimately development of the fighter variant was allowed to proceed with every 20th Me-262 set aside for the fighter role. Yet even these were requested to be completed with some sort of bomb-carrying/release modification.[1]
