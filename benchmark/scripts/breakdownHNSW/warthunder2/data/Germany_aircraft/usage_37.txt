Usage of Bf_109_E-4: 
Just like the Bf 109 E-3, the E-4 is a well versatile fighter, being able to both do hit and run strikes and dogfight enemy planes, even though its strong point is the hit and run tactic having great energy advantage over most enemies it will face. Having a great climb ability and decent acceleration makes it an enemy to be aware of. There are other German planes that can perform the hit and run tactic far better than the 109, for example the Fw 190, the Bf 109 on the other hand is the more versatile fighter. Having a excellent climb ability will give the E-4 the advantage it needs to be able to strike on enemy fighters from above, having a high speed gain in a dive gives the E-4 the ability to easily catch up to enemies. But one con with its speed is that when it gains too much speed it can lock up and be difficult to manoeuvre and pull up. Being able to catch up with enemies is not the only thing the E-4 is good at. It has an average turn rate but in proper hands the E-4 can be a fearsome dogfighter competing with most fighters. Some advantages it has over the Spitfire and Hurricane is the engine, being able to do manoeuvring without choking the engine with lack of fuel from doing manoeuvres.
