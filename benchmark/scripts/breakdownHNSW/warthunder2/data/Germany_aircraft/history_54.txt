History of Ju_88_A-1: 
The Junkers Ju 88 A-1 was the first variant of the famous Junkers Ju 88 bomber. After the failure of the Junkers Ju 86, the Junkers team was tasked to make a new bomber able to go faster than the Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111, and even fighters: a true "schnell bomber" (fast bomber)! The prototypes succeeded in their design requirement, being faster than any fighter then in service, but once all the military equipment was added, it was not much faster than what it was designed to replace. Regardless, it had great promise and with more changes proved to be a capable and adaptable warplane. Combat results with the short wing A-1 were below expectations, only 133 units being built before major upgrades were introduced with the A-4. All surviving A-1s were upgraded to the A-5 long wing standard. Amazingly, an Ju 88 A-1 exists today, being found in a freshwater lake in very good condition, and fully restored.
