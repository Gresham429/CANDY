Usage of Ta_152_C-3: 
Currently the Ta 152 C-3 does not carry any under-wing ordnance, but it can perform rather lethal ground-pounding with its MK 103 (30 mm) cannon, if it is loaded with armoured target rounds (HVAP). Although, one must aim carefully and have good trigger discipline to knock out tanks, lest too many shells be wasted on a single vehicle. But for its intended role of air superiority, the combination of MG 151 20 mm cannons plus the aforementioned MK 103 is lethal against any aircraft in the game. However, the stock belts can be a bit of a pain to use, as half of the load are not the infamous German Minengescho√ü (HEI).
