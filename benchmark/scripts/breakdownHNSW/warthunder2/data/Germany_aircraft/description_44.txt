Description of Do_217_N-2: 
The Do 217 N was one of the many variants built off the Do 217 platform. The Do 217 itself is essentially a bigger, more powerful version of the Do 17. It was a stark contrast to the Do 17 in many ways. While the Do 17 was intended for performance and subsequently had a weak bomb load, the Do 217 had comparable bomb loads to even the He 111. The Do 217 served in many roles, from regular bombing to attacking ships with guided munition such as the Fritz-X radio-controlled bomb. The Do 217 was in service even after World War II with the Swiss Air Force.
