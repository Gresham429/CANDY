Description of Bf_110_C-6: 
In 1934, Hermann Goring issued a specification requirement for a long-range heavy fighter. Soon after, Messerschmitt submitted their design, the Bf 110, along with two other companies, Henschel and Focke-Wulf. The 110 was Messerschmitt's first twin-engine aircraft and was designed almost right after the Bf 109. As all three companies developed their aircraft, the RLM (German Ministry of Aviation) changed the requirements for more armament. Henschel and Focke-Wulf agreed with the requirements, but Messerschmitt rejected the new requirement and stuck with the original design. The performance loss created by the extra firepower in Henschel's and Focke-Wulf's designs led to the Bf 110 having far superior performance, which was later accepted. This marked the beginning of the Bf 110 in its long history, from the mid-1930s to the end of the war.
