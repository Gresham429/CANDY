Description of Tornado_IDS_MFG_(Germany): 
During the acquisition of the Tornado IDS by the Luftwaffe, the Deutschemarine (German Navy) also received 112 Tornado IDS aircraft for the anti-shipping and maritime patrol/reconnaissance roles. The naval Tornados, designated "Marineflieger", were easily recognizable due to the sea-gray liveries they usually used, and were outfitted with special weapon systems not found on the Luftwaffe Tornados, allowing them to use the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile and BL775 cluster munitions. At the end of the Cold War, per the CFE Treaty, half of the Marinefliegers would be removed from naval service and instead incorporated into the Luftwaffe, to replace a wing of reconnaissance RF-4 Phantoms. The remaining Marinefliegers would continue their anti-shipping and maritime roles until 2005, when their units were disbanded and the Tornados were dispersed back into the Luftwaffe and upgraded into the ASSTA standard.
