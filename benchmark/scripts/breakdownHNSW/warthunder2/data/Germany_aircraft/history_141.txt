History of CL-13A_Mk_5_(Germany): 
The CL-13 series of aircraft were built by Canadair under licence from North American Aviation. These fighters would be operated by Canada until 1958, and a variety of other nations until much later, with the last variants being retired by the Pakistani Air Force in 1980. There were two major production runs of the aircraft. The first, the Mk. 2 and Mk. 4s with just under 1,000 built, were very similar to their US counterparts, with minor differences. The second run, the Mk. 5s and Mk. 6s of similar numbers, were patterned on the later versions North American Sabre, with larger wings for improved manoeuvrability. The major difference lay in the replacement of the General Electric J47 engine with the locally-designed more-powerful Avro Canada Orenda. The Mk. 6, with a more powerful two-stage version of the Orenda and improved control surfaces, is generally considered the best of all Sabre variants.
