Description of Fw_190_C: 
As the Allied bombing campaign strengthened, the Germans knew they needed more high-altitude fighters. One of the many high-altitude proposals and designs was the Focke-Wulf 190 C. It was to be powered by the DB 603 with a turbocharger mounted underneath the aircraft. Turbochargers worked by compressing air and providing more power even at high altitudes where the air would be considerably thinner than at sea level. The 190 Câ€™s fuselage was also made longer to accommodate the turbocharger. Although it was quite favourable in testing and orders were put in, the 190 C would ultimately be canceled as the Fw 190 D and Ta 152 were superior aircraft.
