History of Fw_200_C-1: 
The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor is best remembered as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft that searched for Allied convoys over the North Atlantic during World War II. Its mission was to either attack the convoys directly with bombs or communicate their location to the packs of German U-boats below. The Condor started as a transatlantic airliner that first flew in July of 1937. By September of 1939, over 250 Condors had entered military service. The Condor spawned many sub-variants that included different armament, radar, missile carriage and guidance systems, and transport. A handful of these aircraft were used for VIP transports (it was the private plane german chancellor Adolf Hitler that used it for his travel for meetings with other leaders in WWII).
