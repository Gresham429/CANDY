Description of Me_410_B-1/U2: 
The Me 410 B variant was intended to improve on the Me 410 A with better engines. DB 603G engines were planned to be installed, but production and design issues meant the DB 603G would never be put into any aircraft. Thus, the Me 410 B was essentially just a Me 410 A but with more fuel, strengthened undercarriage, and an oxygen system for high-altitude flight. The Me 410 B-1/U2 was specifically almost identical to the A-1/U2, except for the improvements that came with the B variant. The B-1/U2 was intended to fight against bomber formations and received the WB 151A modification set, which added two MG 151s. It also had an armoured glass windscreen and a fighter gunsight.
