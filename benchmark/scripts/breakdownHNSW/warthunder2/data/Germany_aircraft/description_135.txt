Description of IL-28_(Germany): 
Towards the end of WWII, multiple captured German prototype jet bombers found their way into Soviet hands, and were quickly analysed and reverse-engineered. One of the first successful production jet bombers to incorporate the technologies learned from these planes was the new IL-28 bomber, which would go on to become one of the staples of air forces of the Eastern Bloc during the '50s and '60s. One such operator was the East German Air Force (NVA Luftstreitkr√§fte), who used 13 of the type (12 IL-28 and a single IL-28U trainer) between 1954 and 1982, not as a bomber, but rather primarily for target tug and engine testing duties as East German bomber wings were normally outfitted with different, faster, shorter ranged aircraft at the time.
