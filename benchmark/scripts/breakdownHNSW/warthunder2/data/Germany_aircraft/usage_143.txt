Usage of F-86K_(Germany): 
The F-86K should only be used as a support fighter, due to its sub-par manoeuvrability and relatively low top speed compared to other aircraft at its BR such as the MiG-17 at low speeds and the fact that it is most often up-tiered, in which case it is greatly outclassed. These flight performance issues mean the F-86K will not do well in 1 vs. 1 dogfight scenarios, except perhaps in downtiers when fighting against planes like the MiG-15bis and F-86A-5 that the F-86K will be able to out-climb or out-run. However, more often than not the F-86K will be flying against F-105s, AV-8s, F-4s, and the like, to which the F-86K is highly vulnerable to and pose nearly no threat as they can either outrun or out-turn the F-86K, or both. As such it is recommended to work with teammates to help divert the enemy attention while dodging any incoming enemy attacks. With the help of allies, try and get the enemies into a vulnerable state that the F-86K can destroy when the opportunity presents itself.
