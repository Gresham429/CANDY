Usage of Tempest_Mk_V_(Germany): 
The Tempest has great performance in altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,404 ft). It isn't recommended to hunt bombers. The aircraft is best at destroying less manoeuvrable planes like: Fw 190s, F4U Corsairs, Bf 109s, ground attack planes and any bomber that comes near the ground. It excels at high speeds. However it isn't a classic boom-and-zoom aircraft because you shouldn't fly too high after attack. The guns reach maximum efficiency when firing in bursts. Try to avoid long bursts, a burst should not exceed 5-6 bullets. You should replace the climbing with flying away in a more or less straight line. Don't attack unless you can fly away at a high airspeed (at least 500 km/h or 269 knots).
