Description of He_111_H-16: 
The He 111 H-16 was one of the many variants built from the He 111. At the beginning, He 111s were powered by Daimler-Benz engines, specifically the DB 600. However, the He 111 E introduced the Junkers Jumo 211 engine, which was a direct competitor to the DB 600. The main difference was the increase in power, but it was relatively the same as the DB 600. Many variants after the He 111 E continued to use the Jumo 211, but there were some exceptions that were powered by the DB 601.
