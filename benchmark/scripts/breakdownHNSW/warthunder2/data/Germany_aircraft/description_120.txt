Description of Bf_109_Z-1: 
With the Allied bombing campaign gaining more and more strength, the demand for a counter was at an all-time high. Other aircraft, like the Me 210, were considered for the role but ultimately a very unique aircraft would be produced: the Bf 109 Z-1 "Zwilling" (German for "twin"). Based on the previous idea of merging two Heinkel He-111 bombers, Messerschmitt engineers fused two Bf 109 airframes together to create one aircraft. Although it had two airframes, one of them would house the pilot, and the other was blocked off, making it a single-seat fighter. The first prototype was called the "Bf 109 Z-0" but was shortly bombed after it was finished. That didn't stop the project, and a year later, the Z-1 was produced and almost ready for tests until it was abruptly cancelled. The Z-1 fused two 109 G-6 airframes and featured high-powered cannons. It was also nicknamed "Sledgehammer" due to its impressive cannon armament.
