Description of MiG-21bis-SAU_(Germany): 
By the prime of the 1970s, the East German Air Force started receiving the MiG-21bis to update their fighter-interceptor fleet from the aging MiG-21MFs and PFMs. East Germany would receive exactly 46 of the type, with 14 of them being the "Fishbed-L" variant, equipped with the Lazur-M GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) guidance system. The other 32 would be the "Fishbed-N" variant, equipped with the Polyot-OI guidance system instead. To differentiate the two variants, the aircraft received unique names in East German service, being called the MiG-21bis Lazur-M and the MiG-21bis-SAU respectively. The only way to visually tell apart the two aircraft is by a single antenna under the forward fuselage, which is missing on one of the variants due to its different guidance system.
