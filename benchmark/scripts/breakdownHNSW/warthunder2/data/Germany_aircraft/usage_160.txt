Usage of MiG-21_%22Lazur-M%22_(Germany): 
Using the speed of the MiG-21's interceptor role and design is key to success in this aircraft. Utilising a "Boom-and-Zoom" playstyle is most effective, however the MiG-21 does have an ace up its sleeve: it turns remarkably well, you can confidentially turn with F-5 Tigers in it. However, the drawback of having small wings is that you lose a lot of your energy when turning, quite like the F-5. In short, play mainly as a Boom-and-Zoom fighter, but use your AoA (Angle of attack in relation to airflow/direction) to your advantage in those tight situations. Always be wary of F-5's as they can pose a threat to your playstyle as they match it and as per usual keep an eye out for those missiles.
