Description of MiG-23MF_(Germany): 
Shortly after the introduction of the MiG-23M into Soviet service, a "watered down" variant was conceived for export to foreign customers. The resulting design, the MiG-23MF, came in two flavours, designated Izdelyie 23-11A and 23-11B. The primary difference was that the 23-11A was essentially a MiG-23M with the nuclear delivery systems removed, for export to Warsaw Pact countries, while the 23-11B was even more watered down with a downgraded radar, IFF, autopilot, and GCI controller, specifically for export to third-world and Middle Eastern countries.
