Usage of Fw_190_D-13: 
Generally, upon entering a match the D-13 is best utilized as a "side climber". Instead of climbing towards the enemy, take a different route. Once you reach a reasonable altitude, turn back towards the fray. By doing this, you end up arriving at the fight above both your teammates and your enemies, which is very helpful. Although this method takes more time, you can not only dive on unsuspecting enemies but you can also help other pilots on your team. If a teammate looks like he is having trouble shaking an enemy or pulling the lead, you can swoop in and help out.
