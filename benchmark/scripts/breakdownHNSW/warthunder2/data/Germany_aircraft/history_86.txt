History of Do_335_A-0: 
Redeveloped as a multi-role fighter in late 1942 after the original design as a bomber was cancelled, the Do 335 Pfeil carried a pair of the largest piston engines Germany created during WWII, the DB603 series of inverted V12. The inline design was intended to give dual-engine power but without the parasitic drag that the usual wing-mounted arrangement suffered. By May of 1944, the Do 335 was recognized as such a superior aircraft, with good handling and unmatched speed, that Hitler ordered maximum priority to be given to its production. But Allied bombing campaigns forced Dornier to bring up a new plant to handle production, and the delay meant less than 30 of the aircraft were built and flown before the end of the war.
