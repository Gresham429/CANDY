History of Do_217_N-1: 
The Dornier Do 217 is a multi-role aircraft (bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, night fighter) built for the Luftwaffe during World War 2. It is very similar to many previous Dornier built bombers, such as the Dornier Do 17, in its 'Flying Pencil' shape and fuselage. Overall 1,925 Dornier Do 217s were made as well as many variants. The Do 217 J and Do 217 N variants were mainly used as night fighters to deal with the RAF's nightly bombing raids. The rest of the variants would be used as bombers or reconnaissance aircraft depending on which mission they would be on.
