Usage of G.50_serie_2_(Germany): 
In general, it is a slightly worse version of the M.C 200, and as such, it very much flies the same, albeit a little bit slower. With its decent rate of climb, it's generally best to ensure you have proper altitude to play around with first. Generally for low-tier planes like the G.50, 3,000 - 4,000 m is generally enough, from there, the way of flying should be dedicated by the situation and opponents. Its good acceleration in dives and respectable dive speeds means it can be used as a pure Boom and Zoomer, especially when you realise its energy retention is better than that of many other planes at its BR. However, it is a decent turn-fighter, barring the poor acceleration so it can be used as such as well. Be careful against regular biplanes and Japanese monoplanes, both of which are considerably better, bar high speeds, where the stiffness of controls on the G.50 are less than on either biplanes or Japanese planes.
