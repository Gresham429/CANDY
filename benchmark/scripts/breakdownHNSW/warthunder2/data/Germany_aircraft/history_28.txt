History of G.50_AS_serie_7_(Germany): 
The Fiat G.50 "Freccia" ("Arrow") was the first Italian all-metal monoplane fighter to be adopted by the Regia Aeronautica. Development of the fighter began in 1936, at the request of the Italian Air Force, and ended with the creation of an easy-to-manage and extremely manoeuvrable interceptor. The "Arrow" used such modern technology as a constant-speed all-metal propeller and variable pitch, as well as retractable landing gear. The Fiat G.50 competed with a number of contemporary Italian designs like the Macchi C.200 "Saetta". It was a clear step above the CR.42 "Falco" biplane fighters that had equipped the Italian military at the time: the all-metal monoplane construction with retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit gave it superior speed to the outdated Falco. The development process was complicated, however, and the G.50 underwent many revisions in response to changing specifications and design flaws uncovered by testing. For example, the enclosed cockpit was abandoned after the first production series. Though it arrived and began production earlier than the C.200, the overall performance of the Freccia was somewhat inferior, especially in terms of speed. The "Arrow" however, could not take advantage of the monoplane design because its engine was too weak (at 840 hp). The aircraft's limited armament was also a weakness - it had two synchronous large-calibre machine guns with 150 rounds of ammunition. It was retained since retooling the Fiat factories to produce Saettas would take too much time, effort, and resources. The basic G.50 was produced from 1937 to 1940. It saw considerable service during World War II, but due to the rapid pace of aircraft technological development, it was outdated even at the start of the war. The first series of 45 G.50s, production of which began in late 1937, had a closed cockpit, and while it provided relatively good visibility, the pilots were not very enthusiastic about it, so the second series of planes (200 aircraft) were built with an open cockpit. All in all, 833 G.50s were build (including all variants). The Fiat G.50's Slow speed, poor armament, limited range, and a complete lack of armour protection did it no favors. The Hawker Hurricane, itself not a cutting-edge fighter, at times outclassed the Freccias during their deployment in the Battle of Britain. The G.50 had somewhat more success in North Africa against British aircraft. They were eventually relegated to fighter-bomber roles, which they fulfilled well. Other users of the Freccia included the Independent State of Croatia and Finland. The latter used their G.50s to surprisingly good effect against the Soviet Union, but they were ill suited for the freezing northern climate and were held in lower regard than other foreign aircraft obtained by the Finnish Air Force.
