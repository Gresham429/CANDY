Description of F-104G_(Germany): 
The F-104G was the most common variants of the Starfighter family, with over 1,000 built by various companies like Lockheed, Fokker, Fiat, etc. Germany was also one of the biggest users of the Starfighter with over 900 purchased. However, Germany struggled with the F-104 and would later earn the nickname Witwenmacher ("Widowmaker") from the German public due to its high accident rate. Over 250 planes were lost in accidents and 100+ Luftwaffe pilots died as a result. Fortunately, as Germany addressed the problems with the F-104 program the accident rate decreased to a rate similar to other countries operating the Starfighter.
