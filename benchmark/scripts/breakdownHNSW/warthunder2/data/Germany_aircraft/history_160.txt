History of MiG-21_%22Lazur-M%22_(Germany): 
The "Lazur-M" (Лазурь-М; Azure-M), also known by its equipment name ARL-SM, was a communication equipment for PVO (Air-Defense Force) jets as part of their land-based air-defense system "Dozduh-1" (Воздух-1; Air-1). Lazur-M was first installed on the MiG-21S and retained on later models of the MiG-21 including the MiG-21bis; these were the base model of earlier MiG-21bis exported to Warsaw Pact countries, and the LSK (East German Air Force) was one of the users. Later deliveries were equipped with the Polyot ILS system (producing the MiG-21bis-SAU; Sistema Avtomaticheskovo Upravleniya, Automatic Landing System).
