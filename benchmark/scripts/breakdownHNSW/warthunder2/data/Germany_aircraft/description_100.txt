Description of Bf_109_G-14: 
The Bf 109 G-14 was one of the late-war variants of the 109 series. It aimed to standardize all the improvements from the other G models, such as a taller tail, a new engine, and the all-important MW-50 system, which drastically increased power by injecting a methanol-water mix into the engine. This allowed the engine to run at higher boost pressures and significantly increased the top speed compared to the G-6 variant. Although late-war Allied aircraft could outperform the G-14, it was still more than capable with an experienced pilot. Over 5,500 G-14s were built until the end of the war.
