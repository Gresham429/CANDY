Usage of Do_17_E-1: 
The Do 17 E-1 can be used in two distinct methods. The pilot can dive to low altitude to reach higher speeds and use the 10 x 50 kg bombs to eliminate ground targets or it can be used as a support bomber flying behind other heavy bombers and finishing bases. This approach is dangerous and less rewarding because you are slow as you climb and fighters can easily pick you off.
