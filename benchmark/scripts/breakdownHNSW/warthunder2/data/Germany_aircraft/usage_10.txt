Usage of Do_17_Z-7: 
The Do 17 Z-7 is the first twin-engine heavy fighter that is unlocked in a long line of German "Zerst√∂rer" (lit. "Destroyer", used to refer to heavy fighters) aircraft. Like all of its successors, the Do 17 Z-7 is a full-bred Boom & Zoom fighter, through and through. This means the Do 17 should, under any circumstances always strive to maintain an altitude advantage over enemy aircraft. Utilise the potential energy to dive on them and make a high speed pass while firing, then quickly make an escape. There is however, a couple of caveats for the Do 17 Z-7 that is worth considering when flying it.
