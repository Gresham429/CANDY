Description of Hunter_F.58_(Germany): 
The ◌Hunter F.58 with a tail number of J-4020, was one of the Hawker Hunters in Swiss Air Force service and a member of the Patrouille Suisse ("Swiss Patrol") Aerobatic Team. This aircraft with factory code 41H-691768 was first flown on 4th February 1958, and subsequently joined the Swiss Air Force during the 1960s alongside another 87 F.58 (exported F.6). These jets were further upgraded under the KAWEST (Kampfwertsteigerung; Increased Operational Performance) in 1964 with RWR, an ECM pod, and chaff dispensers,as well as capabilities to launch AIM-9 and AGM-65B, turning it into a multi-role fighter for the Swiss until they were replaced by the F-5E. The remaining fleet of Hunters with the special livery of the Patrouille Suisse eventually retired in 1994 and the jet represented in-game is currently displayed at the northern corner of Dübendorf Airfield on the outskirts of Zurich.
