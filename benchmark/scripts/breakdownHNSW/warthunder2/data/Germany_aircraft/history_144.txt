History of Lim-5P_(Germany): 
The MiG-17 (NATO: Fresco) has been the weapon of choice for Warsaw Pact or allies of Soviet Union and has already been exported to tens of countries throughout the 1950s; while the development for supersonic jets were still in progress, some countries with better heavy industry capabilities decided to get the license for building them domestically. Aside from the other wide-spread build of Shenyang J-5 (æ­¼-5), the other licensed build was the WSK "PZL-Mielec" Lim-5 and 6 from Poland.
