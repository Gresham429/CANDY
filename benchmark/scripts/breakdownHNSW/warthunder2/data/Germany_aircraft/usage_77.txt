Usage of Fw_190_A-5/U2: 
The Fw 190A-5/U2, as all the planes in this line, are some of the best "Boom and Zoomers" in the game and should be flown exclusively in this style. The performance at high speeds is excellent, as is their dive and zoom characteristics. Do not ever engage in a turn fight as this will most likely end bad. Instead fight only in the vertical. Try to have an altitude, or speed advantage over your opponents (by climbing to the side at the start of the battle and then enter the highest battle you see). But you can still win fights, when you are lower in energy than your foe.
