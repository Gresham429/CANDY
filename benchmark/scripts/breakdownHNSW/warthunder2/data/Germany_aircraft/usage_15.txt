Usage of Ju_87_R-2: 
In Arcade Battles you should concentrate on killing tanks and pillboxes first (if any) with your bombs, and use your offensive machine guns to kill soft targets like armoured cars, artillery, howitzers and AA. In this mode, you won't need your air brakes since you can't break your wings and it's easy to pull up from a fast dive attack, and its recommended that you keep as much of your speed up from the dives so you are harder to intercept by enemy aircraft. Another viable option on maps with light vehicles is to stay at altitude, dive,
drop your 1,000 kg bomb, and climb again, circling until you get another bomb. This work most effectively on maps with groups of armoured cars that are clustered, bot in a line.
