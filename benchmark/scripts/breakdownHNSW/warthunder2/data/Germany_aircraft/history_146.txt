History of G.91_R/3_(Germany): 
The G.91 Small Sabre entered service with the Luftwaffe in 1962 after winning the 1953 NATO light tactical support aircraft competition. This competition had called for a fighter which could carry 452 kg of ordnance, patrol a combat radius of 180 km assuming 10 mins over the target, average cruising speed of at least 705 km/h and Mach 0.95 capability. It also had to be fully operational on grass or other types of unprepared runways, with a take-off distance of 1,100 m. The R/3 was the Luftwaffe's version of the G.91, but with more powerful armament, two wing points for suspended ordnance and better avionics than the Italian Air Force's R/1s. Fifty R/3s were built in Italy starting in 1959 and another 294 were license-built in West Germany. The Luftwaffe also received another 50 of the very similar R/4 aircraft after orders for Greece and Turkey fell through. The Luftwaffe also had 66 T-3 two-seat trainer models built of which twenty-two were built in Germany.
