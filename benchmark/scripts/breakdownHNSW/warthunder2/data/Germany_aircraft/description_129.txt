Description of He_162_A-2: 
Initially designated the He 500, the He 162 was a very unique jet fighter. The He 162 was aptly nicknamed "Salamander" but was later given the official name "Volksj√§ger". It was intended to be flown by anyone, beginners and experts alike. One of the unique design features of the Salamander is the single jet engine mounted on the top of the fuselage. This provided easy access for maintenance and protected the engine from ingesting rocks or other debris on runways. The A-1 was armed with dual MK 108 cannons, but excessive vibrations when firing forced the A-2 variant to utilize the 20 mm MG 151 cannon found in many German aircraft. Although the Salamander had unfavourable landing and stall characteristics, it was quite a comfortable aircraft to fly, and pilots noted it was stable in flight.
