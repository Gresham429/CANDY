Usage of Bf_109_Z-1: 
The Zwilling sits at a rather uncomfortable spot as a heavy fighter, it's fast in a straight line and it climbs well, however the plane doesn't have much else going for it. You will only win a dogfight to an F-82, you will not stand a chance against single engined fighters and you have to reserve the plane to a very passive playstyle in order to capitalize on the pros of the plane.
