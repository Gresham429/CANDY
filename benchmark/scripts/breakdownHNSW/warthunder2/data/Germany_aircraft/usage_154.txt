Usage of MiG-21MF_(Germany): 
While the â—ŠMiG-21MF itself is a pretty mediocre fighter, it has access to 4 deadly R-60 missiles. These missiles work the best when enemy is slow, so the recommended tactic is to wait a bit before engaging into the battle. Acquiring a radar lock will slave the R-60's seeker to the target which can help leading the missile before launch.
