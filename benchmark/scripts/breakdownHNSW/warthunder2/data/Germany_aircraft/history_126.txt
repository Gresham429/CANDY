History of Me_262_C-2b: 
After constant bombing raids by Allied bombers, Germany realized they needed a more capable interceptor that could reach the heights bomber crews operated at in record time. One of the proposals was the Me 262 C. Nicknamed Heimatsch√ºtzer ("Home Defender"), these variants were intended to be fitted with one or more rockets that would greatly increase the climb rate and reach Allied bombers much faster. The Me 262 C-2b would receive two BMW 109-718 rocket motors mounted on the engines. The fuel pumps would inject both a nitric acid oxidizer and hydrocarbon fuel. This generated around 2,200 lb of thrust and greatly boosted the climb rate. During the Me 262 C-2bs one and only test flight, it managed to achieve 30,000 feet (~9,100 m) in only three minutes. Unfortunately for the C-2b, it was introduced far too late into the war to have any impact.
