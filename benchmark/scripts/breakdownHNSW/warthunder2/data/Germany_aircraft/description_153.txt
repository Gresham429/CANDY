Description of F-4F_(Germany): 
In the early 1980s, around ten years after Germany received their Phantoms, Germany decided to retrofit their F-4Fs in an attempt to modernize them. The F-4Fs at the beginning of their lifecycle were stripped down F-4Es in an attempt to reduce the cost and lost many abilities that the F-4E had. For example, the F-4E could launch AIM-7 Sparrow radar missiles and use guided weapons like Mavericks or Walleyes. Between 1980 and 1983, the F-4Fs regained the ability to fire AIM-7s and use guided weaponry. In addition, it could launch AIM-9L Sidewinders and the electronics were improved.
