Description of Ju_88_A-1: 
The original "short wing" version of the famous Ju 88 family, the Ju 88 A-1 also had less powerful engines greatly limiting its war load. In the end only 133 of this model was ever built, with most being upgraded later. Amazingly, one of this incredibly rare version still exists in Norway today!
