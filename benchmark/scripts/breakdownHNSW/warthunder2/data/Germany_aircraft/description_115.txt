Description of He_177_A-5: 
The He 177 has its origins well before World War 2 even began with the German Air Ministry's Bomber A  specifications. Heinkel took up the task of building a long-range bomber that could hit a top speed of 571 km/h (355 mph) and a range of over 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometres). In addition, it also needed to be able to carry up to 4,400 lb (1,995 kg) of bombs. This was far above any bomber at the time and almost impossible to achieve. Although plans began in the mid-1930s, the final design and production wouldn't come to fruition until well into the war. Around 1,000 He 177 "Greif" (Griffon in German) bombers were built. It was far too late in the war to have any noticeable impact and was still plagued with issues. Most notoriously its tendency to catch fire during flights due to poor engine cooling system.
