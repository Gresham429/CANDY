Usage of Me_410_A-1/U4: 
The Me 410 A-1/U4 is an air vehicle that performs well in two different roles. The first is bomber interception due to its large calibre 5 cm BK 5 cannon, but the poor climb rate when compared to other variants of the 410 limit its effectiveness in this mission. Granted, single-handedly shooting down heavy bombers is quite enjoyable from a pure gameplay perspective. The excellent armour-piercing capabilities of Me 410 A-1/U4 cannon make ground attack a viable option. However, the Hs 129B-3 with its 7.5 cm BK 7,5 cannon can deliver more punch to its target while an aircraft armed with 3.7 cm weapons can also penetrate the rear and side armour of all types of armoured vehicles while having more ammunition at their disposal. For this reason, bomber interception might be a more viable option. Of course, enemy fighters will be your primary concern, since the Me 410 A-1/U4 has poor climb rate and turn time, but your rear machine guns with good firing radius can provide some retribution.
