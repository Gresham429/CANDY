Description of F-84F_(Germany): 
After an 11-year hiatus, the West German Air Force was revived after Germany was brought into NATO to counter the Soviet threat. As part of the initiative to further arm countries in NATO, multiple countries like West Germany and Italy received hundreds of F-84F Thunderstreaks. The Luftwaffe received over 400 F-84Fs in the late 1950s and early 1960s. JagdBomberGeschwader 31 (JBG31) would be the first air wing with the F-84Fs. As more air wings received the Thunderstreaks, the accident rate went up as well. Germany had a 25+% loss rate with the new Thunderstreaks and the public complained about it. This trend would continue with the F-104, the next plane the Luftwaffe ordered to replace the F-84F in 1966.
