History of Me_163_B: 
The aptly named "Komet" (Comet) was not an emergency fighter but a result of years of development, all the brainchild of one of the great aircraft pioneers, Dr. Alexander Lippisch.  Following the first world war, he was employed with the Zeppelin Company, a prestigious company with leading aeronautical research. There he became interested in tailless aircraft and despite the Versailles Treaty restricted times experimented and developed many tail first (canards, French for "duck") and tailless gliders.  In 1928 Fritz von Opel, son of the famous automotive manufacture and infamous for rocket-powered vehicles wanted to make a rocket-powered aircraft, and the Lippisch "Ente" (duck) was perfect. Although the Ente was destroyed on its second flight and Opel moved on to make his own design, the seed for rocket-powered aircraft was planted in Lippisch.
