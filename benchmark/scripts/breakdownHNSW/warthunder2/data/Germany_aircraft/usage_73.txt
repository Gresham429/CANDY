Usage of Bf_110_C-6: 
The Bf 110 C-6 is best suited at ground attack and bomber interception roles. The 30 mm chin-mounted cannon can load both HVAP and HE rounds giving it flexibility in both Air RB and Ground RB. The Bf 110 C-6 can intercept bombers, destroy tanks and pillboxes with its 30 mm cannon but struggles in dogfights with fighters unless it had the altitude/energy advantage. The lack of 20 mm cannons leaves the C-6 nothing to fall back on except four machine guns. The C-6 is a great ground attacker in ground battles as the 30 mm cannon can penetrate most tanks at its rank.
