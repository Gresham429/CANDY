Description of P-47D_(Germany): 
The ▀P-47D Thunderbolt is a premium gift rank III German fighter 
with a battle rating of 3.7 (AB/SB) and 4.3 (RB). It has been in the game since the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. Since Germany never captured any bubble-canopy variants of the P-47, this aircraft was removed from sale for historical reasons during Update "New Power". It was replaced by the more historically accurate "razorback" P-47D-16-RE (Germany).
