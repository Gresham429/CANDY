History of Ta_152_H-1: 
Throughout much of World War II in Europe, the German Luftwaffe was only concerned with their aircraft flying in the mid to low altitudes (20,000 ft/6,100 m and below), therefore a majority of their fighter fleet only utilized a single-stage supercharger which was sufficient for their role. However, with the introduction of the B-29, the threat of this type of bomber would have been out of reach for most of the German air fleet.[1] To counter high-altitude allied fighters and bombers, the Fw 190D-9 was modified with a two-stage supercharged Junkers Jumo 213E engine which allowed it to achieve the higher altitudes, however, the shorter stubby wings well know for low altitude manoeuvrability actually hindered performance at altitude, though usable, not really a suitable fix.[2]
