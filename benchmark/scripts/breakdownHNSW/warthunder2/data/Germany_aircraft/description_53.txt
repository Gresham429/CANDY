Description of Fw_200_C-1: 
The Fw 200 C-1 "Condor" was the first military production variant of the Condor. It featured four supercharged BMW 132H engines each producing over 800 hp. Although the airframe was reinforced from the pre-production version, Condors had a habit of the fuselage splitting in two just behind where the wings meet during landings. Eight Condors were lost this way until the C-3 variant which had more reinforcement. The Condors were first delivered to Kampfgeshwader 40 (KG 40) who used the Condors for anti-shipping duties. Crews of the C-1 complained about the lack of defensive armament and protection for the fuel system. Nonetheless, the Fw 200 C-1 was quite dangerous when it made its debut. The Allies didn't have a good counter against the Condors until more CAM (catapult aircraft merchant) ships were sailing.
