Description of Me_410_B-2/U4: 
The Me 410 B was planned to be fitted with the DB 603G engine and a few other improvements. However, due to the shortage of the new engine, early production of the Me 410 B instead utilized the regular DB 603A found in the Me 410 A. Some Me 410 B's received an oxygen system for high-altitude flights as well as a better undercarriage. The Me 410 B-2/U4 Zerstörer (Destroyer in German) was fitted with a 5 cm cannon mounted in the chin of the nose. Around 130 planes of this variant were produced, 80 built at Messerschmitt's factory and the rest built at Dornier's factory. In addition to the giant cannon, it also had two 20 mm MG 151 cannons as part of the Waffenbehӓlter conversion set.
