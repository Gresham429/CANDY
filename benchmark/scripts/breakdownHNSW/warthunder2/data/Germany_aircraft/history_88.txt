History of Do_217_E-2: 
The Do 217 was designed to meet the requirement of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Air Ministry) for a heavy night bomber or a float-equipped anti-shipping dive bomber. Dornier experimented with the Do 17 with an enlarged fuselage, more powerful engine and almost twice the bomb load of the original Do 17. Dive brakes were fitted under the wings with Daimler-Benz DB601B engines. This design proved underpowered and manoeuvrable. Instability was a problem, this was soon fixed by installing Handley Page Leading edge slats. The final version used Jumo 211A engines instead of the DB601 and the proposed DB603. Different tail sections were tested out on this version of the Do 217. The final design entered service as the Do 217 E-2. With BMW 801A 14 cylinder radial air-cooled engines. This version of the Do 217 did not have tail mounted dive-brakes. The engine unit was interchangeable with Jumo 211 engines as part of the "Power Egg" concept. The Do 217 normally carries a crew of four: bomb-aimer/observer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio operator, ventral gunner/flight engineer, and a pilot. The dive brake in the original version was removed.
