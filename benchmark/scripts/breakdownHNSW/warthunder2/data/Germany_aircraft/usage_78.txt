Usage of Fw_190_D-9: 
The Fw 190 D-9 should utilise its great climb rate to reach high altitudes in order to perform Boom-n-Zoom runs on enemy fighters or to hunt bombers. Although it has the powerful cannons mounted close to the centre of the aircraft, head-on engagements are not recommended due to the unprotected and fragile engine. Instead, try to use the aircraft's great energy retention and engine power to outclimb your opponent's aircraft. Despite its reasonably good turn rate, it would be unwise to turnfight with enemy fighters, however you should be able to outmanoeuvre most strike aircraft.
