Description of MiG-19S_(Germany): 
The MiG-19S was a special variant of the MiG-19, incorporating an all-moving slab tail and the Svod long-range navigation receiver. It was armed with three 30 mm NR-30 cannons in comparison to the two found on most other models. The MiG-19S entered production in 1956, and was exported to multiple countries shortly after. One of the countries to receive and use the MiG-19S was Germany, which operated 12 MiG-19S alongside 12 other aircraft of the MiG-19PM variant. The German MiG-19s would serve until 1969, when they were replaced with mid-life models of the MiG-21, such as the MiG-21SPS-K and MiG-21MF
