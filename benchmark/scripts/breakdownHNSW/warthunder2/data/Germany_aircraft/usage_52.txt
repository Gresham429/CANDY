Usage of Me_410_B-2/U4: 
In Air Realistic Battles, Me 410 B-2/U4 players can go for either enemy aircraft or ground targets. Since all the cannons have an air target belt, players can easily down an enemy fighter or bomber with these selected. The B-2/U4 also comes with an attacker air spawn, which gives it a slight edge in coming into battle quickly. However, the lacklustre performance means that even with the airspawn, enemy fighters will still easily gain an altitude advantage. It will also be difficult to reach the air spawn altitude for long-range bombers. If used to attack enemy aircraft, Me 410 B-2/U4 players should side-climb till the enemy planes lose their altitude advantage or are in a furball. This playstyle is quite hard to pull off due to its poor performance, so players should stray away from it.
