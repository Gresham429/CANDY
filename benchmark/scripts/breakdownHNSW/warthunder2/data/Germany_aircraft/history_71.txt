History of Wellington_Mk_Ic_(Germany): 
Performance-wise the Wellington was not notably remarkable, its strength lay on the inside. Devised by one of the greatest innovative thinkers in history, Sir Barnes Neville Wallis devised a geodesic structure resulting in an exceptionally strong airframe. Together with Reginald Kirshaw "Rex" Pierson, they designed their record making Vickers Wellesley opening the way for the Wellington and larger Warwick. With high aspect ratio wing and spacious fuselage, it proved capable of handling a myriad of missions including early airborne radar and robust enough to absorb severe damage and fly home. Although the bomb bay configuration limited bomb size its payload was slightly more than the Heinkel He 111 H-3 and with greater range. It is also one of the first aircraft to have a powered turret in the extreme tail with a very wide arc; however, it still was inadequate to defend itself against attacking fighters and early models lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. Still, this aircraft was admired by crews and affectionately called Wimpy after Popeye's hamburger loving friend and sidekick who's full name is J. Wellington Wimpy. Over 11,000 made, it equipped many RAF squadrons including those comprised of foreign crews like the Polish (4 squadrons), New Zealand (No. 75), and Czech (No, 311) one of which was captured by Germans who used it for intelligence and training. Viking, a passenger transport variant, became the world's first pure jet transport prototype aircraft in 1948.
