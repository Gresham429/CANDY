Usage of Bf_109_F-1: 
Just as the with the E-1, new players should adopt a hit and run tactic with the Bf 109s (also known as Boom and Run). While often called a Boom & Zoom aircraft, the Bf 109s are not dedicated Boom & Zoomers, and many other aircraft such as the Fw 190 do it much better. While it is true that a pure Boom & Zooming approach can be used for the Bf 109s, limiting oneself to this enormously undermines plane efficiency. It is a pure breed energy fighter.
