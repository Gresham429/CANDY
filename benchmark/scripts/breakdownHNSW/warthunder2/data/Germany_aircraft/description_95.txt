Description of BV_155_B-1: 
The BV 155 was one of the many designs Germany developed during World War II for high-altitude performance. It first started life with Messerschmitt, respectively called the Me 155. At this point, the Me 155 was developed to be a carrier fighter aboard the Graf Zeppelin. The Me 155 was developed with the strict goal of using as many parts from the Bf 109 as possible. It still used the DB 605 engine, and the fuselage was from the Bf 109 G variant. However, it had new wings and carrier-specific features like folding wings and an arrestor gear. Due to delays with the Graf Zeppelin, the Me 155 project was put on hold for the indefinite future. Messerschmitt continued to work on the project until the RLM (German Ministry of Aviation) saw numerous deficiencies and moved the work to Blohm & Voss.
