Description of MiG-15bis_(Germany): 
During the early '50s, a design proposal for an upgraded MiG-15, titled the MiG-15bis (second), was issued. The main upgrade was the new VK-1 engine, offering a lot more thrust. The East German air force would start receiving the upgraded MiG-15bis not long after it entered service with the USSR and proved itself there. The MiG-15bis would serve as the frontline fighter of the NVA, being later supplemented by the MiG-17 and its licensed copy, the Lim-5, before being ultimately replaced by proper 3rd generation fighters such as the MiG-21F in the late '60s and early '70s.
