Usage of MiG-19S_(Germany): 
Farmer pilots will need to rely on the power of their engines above all else to come out victorious in battle. Little at top tier can match the raw power of the MiG-19S's dual afterburning engines, which allow the pilot the safety to deal with slower aircraft at his or her own pace, as the defender slowly loses their energy.
