Usage of Bf_109_F-2: 
Just as the with the E-3, new players should adopt a hit and run tactic with the Bf 109s. While often called BnZ aircraft, the 109s are not dedicated Boom'n'Zoomers and many other aircraft such as the Fw 190 do it much better. While it is true that a pure Boom and Zooming approach can be used for the 109s, limiting oneself to this enormously undermines plane efficiency. It is a pure breed energy fighter.
