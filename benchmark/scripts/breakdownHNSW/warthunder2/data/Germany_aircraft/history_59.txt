History of IL-2_(1942)_(Germany): 
This particular IL-2 (1942) was originally marked as Red/White 4 of the Soviet Air Force and was captured by the Germans on the Eastern Front. The aircraft's paint scheme suggests it was most likely built at Zavod 18, as it is typical of paint schemes from this particular factory. All weapons were removed (and later reinstalled) and all markings were painted over, with the addition of a yellow band painted in front of the tail section and under the tips of the wings. Of note is the lack of the inclined Swastika which was present on the original.
