Description of Fw_190_A-1: 
The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Würger (Shrike) was a single-seat, single-engine monoplane fighter used by the Luftwaffe in WWII. One of the best fighters of the time, it was widely used during the Second World War. A total of over 20,000 were produced, including some 6,000 fighter-bomber variants. The Fw 190 remained in production from 1941 until the end of the war, going through multiple redesigns. The Fw 190 made a name for itself as a true Luftwaffe workhorse and was used in a wide variety of roles, including high-altitude interception (especially the Fw 190 D), escort, fighter-bombing and night fighting. The officially designated nickname "Würger" denotes a kind of carnivorous bird (a shrike), but can also be translated as choker, or strangler. In that regard, it fits the contemporary English designation well, too: "Butcher-bird".
