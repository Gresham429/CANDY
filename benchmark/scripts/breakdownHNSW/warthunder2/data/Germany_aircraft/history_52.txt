History of Me_410_B-2/U4: 
The Luftwaffe came to the conclusion that the Me 410 was dull and lacklustre in the bomber role. Other planes could do the job far better. As a result, many Me 410s were converted to the Zerstorer standard which was more focused on ground attacking. Zerstorer aircraft were usually fitted with more cannons (30 mm or 20 mm cannons) but some received the 50 mm BK 5 cannon. The Me 410 could still carry bombs but they were usually reserved for tanks and other ground vehicles.
