History of Ju_388_J: 
The Ju 388 J is the heavy-fighter version of the Ju 388, a multirole twin-engined combat aircraft built by Germany late into the Second World War. Based on the Ju 188 and Ju 88, the aircraft was optimized for high-altitude operations to counter the formidable B-29 Superfortress; the aircraft incorporated specific design features for this role including a pressurized cockpit. However, the aircraft was plagued by technical issues and entered service late into the war, meaning that it saw little service.
