Description of Fw_190_D-12: 
The "Dora" variants of the 190 featured an enormous number of improvements over the original "Anton" variants. Also referred to as the Langnasen-Dora ("Long-nose Dora"), it replaced the original radial engine found in the Antons with a water-cooled inverted V12 engine that extended the length of the fuselage and decreased drag. To keep drag to a minimum while also sufficiently cooling the engine, an annular radiator was fitted, which could extend tiny flaps out for increased cooling when needed. This, in combination with the Jumo 213E, meant that the Dora variants were substantially faster and could climb much quicker than the Anton variants.
