Usage of Fw_190_A-5/U14: 
The Fw 190 A-5 U/14 is an excellent fighter. It has great energy retention in a dive, and an excellent flight performance at higher speeds. As such, it should be used as a Boom and Zoom fighter, as its inferior turn rate will make a turnfight end badly for you. The torpedo bomber role is best used in naval battles, as the torpedo severely impacts the flight performance.
