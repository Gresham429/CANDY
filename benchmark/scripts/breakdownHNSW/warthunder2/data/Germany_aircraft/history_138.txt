History of G.91_R/4_(Germany): 
The G.91 R/3 was the primary West German variant of the Fiat-made light fighter, with 50 built in Italy and another 294 under license in West Germany. It had more powerful armament, added two wing hardpoints, and improved avionics compared to the Italian G.91 R-1s. The 50 R/4 that followed were identical to the R/3 other than in terms of armament. The R/4 supposed to have been sold to Greece and Turkey, but after that sale fell through they entered West German service instead.
