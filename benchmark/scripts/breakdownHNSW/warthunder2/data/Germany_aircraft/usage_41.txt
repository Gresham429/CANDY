Usage of Fw_190_A-1: 
When engaging enemy fighters, do it on your terms by climbing first to gain an altitude and energy advantage. Perform boom and zoom attacks by flying over your target, gaining speed by diving towards and taking them out before they can evade, but watch your speed and altitude as the Fw 190's elevators are quite unresponsive and take some time to get used to. You can then climb back quickly at a secure altitude before any opposition tries to catch up. In Arcade, you can go bomber hunting, as you are not limited by ammo count and the Minengescho√ü will make short work of the bombers. Finally, you can also perform ground attack on soft targets. Remember to maintain speed when ground-pounding, as an enemy fighter can blow you out of the air if you have no energy.
