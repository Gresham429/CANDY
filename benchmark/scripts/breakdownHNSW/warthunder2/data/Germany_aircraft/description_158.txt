Description of Su-22M4_(Germany): 
During the 1980s, the Soviet Union and its allies began adopting upgraded variants of the Su-17 fighter-bomber, which was exported as the "Su-22" for Soviet allies. The East German air force would receive 48 of the latest Su-22M4 fighter bomber, along with 8 of the twin-seat Su-22UM-3K trainer aircraft. The German Su-22s would serve as a frontline strike aircraft for the Warsaw Pact countries, and as a primary line of attack during a possible war with NATO. The Su-22M4s would remain in East German service until the re-unification of Germany, when almost all of the German Su-22s were either scrapped or sold off as they were incompatible with NATO hardware and standards. Only a few Su-22M4s were kept and repainted in Luftwaffe liveries for briefly serving as evaluation and testing aircraft.
