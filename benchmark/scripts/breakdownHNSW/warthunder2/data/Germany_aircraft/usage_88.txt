Usage of Do_217_E-2: 
The Do 217 E-2 is capable of reaching over 700 km/h in a dive, making it extremely difficult to intercept when dive bombing from altitude. It has a good climb rate as well, allowing it to reach safer altitudes more easily than other lumbering heavy bombers. Unfortunately, the Do 217 has a rather poor roll rate, which makes it difficult to manoeuvre, especially when fully loaded.
