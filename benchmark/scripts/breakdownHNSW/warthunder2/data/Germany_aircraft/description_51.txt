Description of Me_410_A-1/U4: 
The Me 410 first originated in the Me 210, which was a double-engined heavy fighter and ground attacker. The 410 was developed as a massive improvement over the Me 210 and solved many of its issues. When the Me 410 entered service, it was first utilized as a high-speed bomber. However, Luftwaffe Bomber Command grew displeased with the 410's performance as a bomber and opted to change its role. At this time, Germany was also in great need of a heavy fighter that could attack Allied bomber formations. This led to the Me 410's purpose changing to attack enemy aircraft. Aircraft that were originally intended to bomb were reconverted to the Zerstörer standard. In 1943, orders came down to equip heavy fighters with large calibre cannons to attack enemy aircraft as well as ground-attack. Out of the three cannons proposed, the KwK 5 cm was repurposed for aircraft use. Around 60 Me 410 A-1/U4s were built, but German command also came to the conclusion that the BK 5 cannon was too much. Later variants would drop the 50 mm cannon and simply added more cannons.
