Usage of Me_410_B-6/R3: 
The Me 410 B-6/R3, unlike its predecessors, has two 30 mm cannons in addition to the regular 20 mm cannons found on any Me 410. However, the 7.92 mm machine guns have been removed from the aircraft. With the 30 mm ammunition belts modification, the 30 mm cannons combined with HVAP-T belts make short work of light pillboxes, light and medium tanks, and even heavy tanks if hit on the side or back. Due to this, your primary goal should be unlocking the (Tier III) 30 mm ammunition belts.
