Usage of Do_17_Z-2: 
This bomber, while not having enough payload for a base and being helpless against most fighters, makes an excellent ground attacker. Take out the convoys consisting of light tanks and unarmoured vehicles, gaining a ticket advantage for your team. It is recommended to stay at altitude until you are over the convoy you want to take out, then dive down, drop your bombs, and return to your airfield with the speed gained in the dive. After landing and rearming, try to sneak your way past the remaining fighters of the enemy team and destroy the ground targets left with your bombs and offensive armament.
