Usage of He_112_B-0: 
The offensive weapons are equal to the Bf 109 E-3 with one exception: the nose-mounted machine guns have half the ammo. While this seems to be a drawback for the He 112, it really is not. With 500 rounds per gun, the Heinkel will not run out of ammo any time soon and their effectiveness against "Battle of Britain" aircraft is limited.
