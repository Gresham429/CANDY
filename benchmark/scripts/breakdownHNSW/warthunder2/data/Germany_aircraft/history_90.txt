History of P-47D-16-RE_(Germany): 
There are a few instances of captured P-47s having been used by the Luftwaffe. On 7 November 1943, a P-47 piloted by U.S. 2nd Lt. William E. Roach made an emergency landing on a German airfield. The pilot was made prisoner and the Thunderbolt was given German markings T9+LK, presumably having been used for reconnaissance over England before D-Day. This plane was recaptured later by the Americans when they took the airfield it was based at. At least two other captured P-47s saw service in the German ranks, being used for reconnaissance, testing and propaganda.
