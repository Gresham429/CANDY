Usage of Do_217_E-4: 
The Do 217 E-4 spawns at a significantly lower altitude than long-range bombers making it easier prey for fighter and attacker aircraft. Climbing to high altitude takes a long time which makes it difficult to avoid enemy fighters in the process. The high speed of the plane and high wing-break speed allows for more aggressive moves at the start of a match. Diving for enemy bases instead of climbing can be a surprisingly effective tactic, especially since many fighter pilots don't want to give up their altitude advantage to drop down and scrape the deck just to hunt a low flying bomber.
