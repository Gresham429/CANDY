History of Ju_288_C: 
The Ju 288 C was a prototype German Schnellbomber (fast bomber) and the winner of the "Bomber B" competition, which aimed to replace all German bombers then in service. The Ju 288 C was a highly advanced aircraft employing modern technologies, including a fully pressurized cockpit and remotely controlled defensive armament. The aircraft was built to be faster, higher-flying and longer-ranged than any bomber then in Luftwaffe service, but was unable to reach these aspirational goals due to the failure of its intended power plant, the Junkers Jumo 222. The Ju 288 would never enter operational service, having been cancelled in 1944.
