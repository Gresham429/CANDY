History of He_100_D-1: 
The  He 112 was the Heinkel company's first attempt at making a modern monoplane fighter after having previously designed assorted transport aircraft, airliners, reconnaissance planes, and biplane fighters. By 1936 it had lost to the rival  Messerschmitt Bf 109 in the Luftwaffe's competition due to its largely inferior performance and difficulty of construction, and it was relegated to export only. Heinkel was left licking its wounds and the company begin developing an aircraft that could surpass and replace the Bf 109. The He 112 was determined to be a dead end in terms of potential, so a new design with simpler construction and cleaner aerodynamics was pursuedâ€”lessons learned well from the He 112's failings.
