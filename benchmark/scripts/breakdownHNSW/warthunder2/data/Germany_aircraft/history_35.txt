History of Bf_109_E-1: 
The Bf 109 E-1 is essentially the first "modern" Bf 109. While the earlier models (V [Prototype], A, B, C) were tested during the Spanish Civil War and developed out of the experiences made in that conflict, it took a few more years for it to develop into a true front-line fighter. The E-1 was the first of a new breed of Bf 109 fighters. Entering production in late 1938, the "Emil" quickly replaced its earlier brethren in service with the Luftwaffe. The distinctive chin radiator of the Jumo powered variants was replaced with two much subtler underwing-mounted versions integrated with flaps, and the cowling was redesigned to carry the Daimler-Benz 601 series of engines. The result was a much more aerodynamically efficient aircraft that was more than a match for the new Supermarine Spitfire that was entering service with the RAF around the same time the first Emils were rolling off the production lines. The Bf 109 E-1 was also sent into action with the Condor Legion in the Spanish Civil War during its twilight stages.
