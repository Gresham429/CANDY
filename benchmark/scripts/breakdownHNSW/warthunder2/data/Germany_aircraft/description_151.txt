Description of MiG-21_SPS-K_(Germany): 
During the 1960s and '70s, East Germany had modified their MiG-21PFs into a new standard, which they indigenously called the MiG-21PFM (not to be confused with the Soviet designated MiG-21PFM, a heavily upgraded MiG-21PF using the second-generation MiG-21 body style). However, a problem quickly arose when the East German air force acquired the Soviet designated PFMs, as these planes were vastly different than the upgraded PFs sharing the same name. To avoid further confusion, all Soviet designated MiG-21PFMs in German service would be re-designated into the MiG-21SPS. However, yet again, a naming convention conundrum arose when the later variant of the Soviet MiG-21PFM (Izdelyie 94A) entered service, with the biggest change being the ability to carry a GSh-23 gunpod on the underbelly. To account for the new variant again, the Germans re-designated this variant into the MiG-21SPS-K, with the K standing for Kanone to denote its ability to take a cannon pod.
