Usage of F-84F_(Germany): 
The F-84F gets a bad rap, but it is a surprisingly fun aircraft to fly, more so once spaded. The air spawn is a big help in grinding up the aircraft modifications. Until the bombs are unlocked, use the advantage of the air spawn to climb and look for bombers. If no bombers are present, look for fighters engaging friendlies.
