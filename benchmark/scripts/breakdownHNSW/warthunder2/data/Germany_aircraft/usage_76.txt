Usage of Fw_190_A-4: 
The A-4 is a punishing Boom & Zoom fighter. The armament is fantastic and dive speed/top-speed is very good. Use this to your advantage. As should be familiar now with the previous Focke-Wulf (and future models), the turning capabilities of this plane are very poor. Dogfighting is not recommended with the Fw 190.
