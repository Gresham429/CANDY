Usage of Wellington_Mk_Ic_(Germany): 
If you are playing Arcade battles, the key tactic is to climb, as in Arcade battles the Wellington will not have trouble getting over 5,000 m (16,500 ft). From there you can take out the enemy bases from "Orbit". Once the bases are dead the main airfield can be killed if you have a good escort and fellow bombers.
