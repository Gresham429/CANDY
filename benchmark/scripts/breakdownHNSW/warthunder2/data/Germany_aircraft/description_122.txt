Description of Ju_388_J: 
As a result of the B-29 threat looming over Germany, the RLM (German Ministry of Aviation) set out a requirement for more day fighters that could operate at high altitudes. Many designs were developed and produced, like the Ta 152 H and BV 155. Attempts were made to convert the Ta 154 into a high-altitude fighter but failed due to its wing design. As such, this led to the Ju 88 being repurposed into a bomber destroyer and/or night fighter. Many iterations were developed, like the Ju 188, but the final model would be the Ju 388. The Ju 388 was intended for high-altitude performance. Three variants were planned: the Ju 388 L for photo-reconnaissance, the Ju 388 K for bombing, and the Ju 388 J for fighting enemy aircraft.
