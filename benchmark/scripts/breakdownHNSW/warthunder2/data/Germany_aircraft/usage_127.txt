Usage of Me_163_B: 
The Me 163 brings energy fighting to a whole new level thanks to its immense rate of climb and acceleration, creating its own subgenre of fighting style only shared with the Ki-200 and partially with the Heimatsch√ºtzer variants of the Me-262. Instead of just the usual speed/altitude dynamic, the German rocket fighter brings in a new element, fuel supply. Fuel management is a constant worry when flying in the 163. The most energy-efficient way of using the Komet's engine is to use it to its fullest when climbing, to then shut it off whilst engaging enemies, so, if possible, avoid using the Komet's engine in a straight line. If you are chasing an enemy and you're at a lower energy state than the bandit, it is, of course, reasonable to turn on the engine to catch the enemy, but then, if you are at a lower energy state than an enemy, you've probably done something wrong.
