Description of Do_17_E-1: 
The Do-17 was a light bomber developed by Dornier for the Luftwaffe. It was originally designed very early in the 1930s and saw combat during the Spanish Civil War and, subsequently, World War II. It was developed as a "Schnellbomber" (fast bomber), and it can be clearly seen in its design. Its almost pencil-like airframe earned the Do 17 the nickname "flying pencil". Its fuselage made it a relatively hard target to hit from directly behind and helped it reach a respectable top speed of 338 km/h (210 mph). The E-1 was fitted with two BMW VI V12 engines, which produced around 739 hp each. The thin fuselage, which helped with performance, unfortunately came with the drawback of a relatively low bomb load. The E-1 comes armed with an offensive 7.92 mm machine gun and is defended by two turrets also utilizing 7.92 mm machine guns.
