History of Bf_109_K-4: 
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) moved ahead at break-neck speeds to develop civilian aircraft which secretly doubled as military fighters and bombers, requiring only minor modifications for militarisation. Aircraft designated as transport and airline variants could easily be converted to bombers, and the initial Bf 109 was no different in its purposes. The birth of the Bf 109 started out as a requirement from Hermann Göring, Reichsminister of Aviation, proposed to the newly appointed Theo Croneiß of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW, Bavarian Aircraft Works). The requirement was for a single-seat high-speed courier plane, obviously, one which could be converted into a fighter when the time required. At the same time this requirement went out, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium's (RLM, Reich Aviation Ministry) Technisches Amt (C-AMT) or technical department was tasked with projecting aircraft requirements for potential future air combat and of the four main types determined to be essential, single-seat fighter requirements were published as L.A. 1432/33.
