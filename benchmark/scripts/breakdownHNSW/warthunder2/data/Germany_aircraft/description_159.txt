Description of F-4F_Early_(Germany): 
Developed exclusively for the German Luftwaffe, the â—„F-4F Phantom II (Early) was intended to be a cheaper and lighter version of the F-4E. At the time, Germany considered alternative fighters like a single-seat version of the F-4 and the Mirage F1 but ultimately chose the regular 2-seater Phantom for budget reasons. To keep the cost down, the ability to utilize the Sparrow missile was removed, the number 7 fuel tank was removed (most aft position), and more modifications were done to reduce weight and cost. Ultimately, the F-4F Early was around 3,300 pounds (1,496 kg) lighter than a normal F-4E and deliveries began in late 1973.
