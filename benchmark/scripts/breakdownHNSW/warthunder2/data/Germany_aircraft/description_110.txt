Description of Fw_190_F-8: 
The Fw 190 F-8 is the main serial production of the F-series Fw 190 fighter. The F-series is designed as a multirole ground attack fighter-bomber aircraft meant to replace the obsolete Ju 87 dive bomber. The F-8 variant is based on the Fw 190 A-8,  featuring reinforced airframe to allow it to carry its payload of up to a 1,000 kg bomb. To compensate for worsened flight performance, the F-8 features a slightly modified compressor injector which improves the engine's performance at low altitudes. Despite 6,143 F-8 models were produced it could never fully replace it this late into the war (1944), and as such the F-8 often ended being used as a low altitude fighter-interceptor instead of its ground attacking role.
