Usage of MiG-21bis-SAU_(Germany): 
The MiG-21bis-SAU will feel similar to the preceding MiG-21MF to its pilots, with even quicker acceleration and higher top speed. When playing the MiG-21bis-SAU, it is recommended to keep in mind some of the strengths and weaknesses of the aircraft. As a delta-winged design, similar to the Mirage family or Draken, the MiG-21bis can pull exceptionally hard, and can effectively "point" the nose wherever its pilot wishes. On the other hand, whilst doing so, a lot of speed is lost and sustained turning will eventually rob the MiG of the energy it had going into a fight. Therefore going into sustained dogfights is not recommended, especially against planes such as the F-5, MiG-23/27, or F-14 Tomcat. All of these planes will have much better energy retention in a sustained turn than the MiG-21bis-SAU, and in a sustained turn will eventually simply have a decisive energy advantage over the MiG. Therefore it is recommended to use the MiG-21s ability to pull inside of enemy aircraft to attempt to fire on the enemy aircraft.  If unable to do so, the MiG-21bis should attempt to use the excellent acceleration to reset the fight and try again.
