History of Hs_129_B-3: 
Produced in 1944, the B-3 variant of the Henschel Hs 129 was installed with the 7.5 cm BK 7,5 cannon, a lighter version of the PaK 40 which already been tested on the Junkers Ju 88. The 7.5 cm BK 7,5 had 12 rounds in a rotary magazine. The gun was fully automatic, with a newly designed hydraulic recoil dampening system and a more aerodynamic muzzle brake. The gun pod had a circular port to let the cartridges eject after firing. The 7.5 cm BK 7,5 was the most powerful forward-firing weapon ever fitted to a production aircraft at the time. It can theatrically destroy any armoured target it found. Only 25 units of the Hs 129 B-3 were produced.
