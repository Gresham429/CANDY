Usage of S.M.79_AS_(Germany): 
With a significantly higher BR than the previous two Sparviero models, the 1941 Sparviero features the same bomb load-outs (but can also carry a single torpedo) and armament, with only relatively minor increases in performance. While unable to compete with the Ju 88 or the He 111 H-6 and Fw 200 C-1 Condor in terms of performance or sheer bomb-carrying capacity, respectively, the S.M.79 AS can still perform decently if played carefully.
