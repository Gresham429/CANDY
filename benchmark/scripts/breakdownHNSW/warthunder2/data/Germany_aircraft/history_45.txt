History of Bf_110_C-7: 
Named the "Zerstörer" ("Destroyer" in English), a very appropriate name for its mission, to destroy anything that is in front of it. In the early days of World War 2 the Bf 110 did very well in roaming wolfpacks, being superior to the opposition in the skies over Poland and France, but that changed drastically in the Battle of Britain. Mounting bomber losses resulted in the fateful decision to force the 110's to stay very close to bomber formations, losing position and speed advantages over the RAF fighters. Not surprisingly it resulted in a drastic increase in losses. Faced with faster fighters and more manoeuvrable like the Spitfire it was pulled from the front line, only to return in new roles like the "Jabo" fighter bomber and the "Nachtjäger" night fighter. The most successful role of the aircraft was performing night interdiction duties, where its task was to seek out and destroy enemy aircraft, most notably British bombers participating in night raids. In the "Nachtjäger" role, the plane was equipped with FuG 220 and FuG 202 Lichtenstein radar, optionally equipped with a "Schräge Musik" installation consisting of 2 X 20 mm MG FF/M cannons mounted at a 60 degree angle, and a third crew member seated behind the pilot to assist in the duties with spotting targets, as well as performing the duties of a radar operator.
