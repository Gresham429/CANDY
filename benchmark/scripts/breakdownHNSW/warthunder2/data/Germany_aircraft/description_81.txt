Description of Me_410_A-1/U2: 
The Me 410 A was the result of the design and development of the Me 210. It featured a better airframe and was overall a much better aircraft compared to the Me 210. At the beginning of the Me 410's life, it was mainly focused on being a high-speed bomber. However, as time went on, Luftwaffe Bomber Command grew more dissatisfied with the Me 410's role as a bomber. This, in combination with the need for heavy fighters, redesignated the Me 410 from a high-speed bomber towards fighting enemy aircraft. The Me 410 A-1/U2 was the beginning of this mindset, and it largely ditched the bombs. It was then fitted with the WB 151A "Waffenbehälter" modification set that added two more MG 151s. In total, the Me 410 A-1/U2 had an impressive armament of four MG 151s and two 7.92 mm machine guns. Production shifted towards building Me 410 A-1/U2s, and even regular A-1s were converted to the Zerstörer standard.
