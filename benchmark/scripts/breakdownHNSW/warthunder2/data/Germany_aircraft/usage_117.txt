Usage of Do_335_B-2: 
The three 30 mm cannons make it easy to shoot down even the heaviest bombers the plane will face even in an up-tier. Load the anti-aircraft belts, set the gun conversion to 800 meters, put the plane in a 15Â° climb to get to bomber altitudes quickly and you can snipe away every enemy bomber that crosses your path. Aiming the 30 mm cannons can be hard at first, but they have a relatively shallow learning curve and seeing enemies explode is quite rewarding.
