History of He_112_B-0: 
In 1934, Heinkel Flugzeugwerke company started work on a fighter to participate in the competition created by German Reichsluftministerium (RLM) in order to find a modern fighter aircraft for future needs. The largest portion of inspiration was drawn from the Heinkel He-70 "Blitz", a passenger and postal plane. This plane designed by the GÃ¼nther brothers and introduced in 1933 was quite modern for its time, as it featured an all-metal monocoque fuselage, retractable landing gear and elliptical wings with a reverse gull-wing shape.
