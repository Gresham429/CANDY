History of Do_335_A-1: 
The Dornier Do 335, also known as the "Pfeil" ("Arrow" in German), was a heavy fighter aircraft developed by the Dornier company during World War II. It was Nazi Germany's fastest piston-engined aircraft at the time. Dornier completed as many as 48 Do 335s, and another nine were under construction when the war ended. The original plan issued by the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) called for Dornier to build 310 Do 335s by late 1945, but delays in engine deliveries meant that only a handful of Do 335s were delivered before the war ended.
