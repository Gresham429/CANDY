Usage of He_111_H-3: 
Upon spawning, you should put the plane into a slight climb, so it gains speed and altitude. Head immediately to nearest key ground targets. Ask your teammates to provide escort, the He 111 H-3 is quite durable and can absorb a lot of damage from a pursuing fighter but not several. Next, drop your payload into the targets. Here, it is better to use the 8 x Flam C 250 incendiary bombs, as they can easily take out multiple bases in a single run at this BR.
