History of Ar_234_B-2: 
In late 1940, an order for a turbojet-powered reconnaissance aircraft was issued by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (the German Air Ministry). The winning design was the Arado Ar 234, a high-wing, incredibly fast jet bomber/reconnaissance aircraft with twin Jumo 004 engines. Since Germany's resources were running low the prototype was only able to fly in 1943 and was only able to fly combat missions after D-Day. Even after these setbacks, it was still the world's first operational jet bomber and reconnaissance aircraft.
