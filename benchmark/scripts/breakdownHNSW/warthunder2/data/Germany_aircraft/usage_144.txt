Usage of Lim-5P_(Germany): 
MiG-17 equivalent for the DDR line fighters is the best description for Lim-5P; it is the Polish licensed version of MiG-17PF and this also marks its identity as a all-weather interceptor with a RP-5 radar. It might not be very reliable due to its electronics, but 8 km detection range at higher altitude does also gives players an edge on spotting enemies beforehand; this is especially true in SB since who spot first really matters in this case (but do make sure the target is indeed an enemy). Another feature of Lim-5P is the VK-1F afterburner turbojet engine, players of Shenyang F-5 will soon find themselves at home as this further boost its capability to chase down enemies with lower energy or altitude with ease, sometimes even handling supersonic jets in dire.
