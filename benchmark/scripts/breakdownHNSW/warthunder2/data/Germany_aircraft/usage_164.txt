Usage of MiG-29G_(Germany): 
The MiG-29G is a very efficient air superiority plane. It is based on the MiG-29A variants.The main difference between it and the early A variants is the addition of the R-73E and R-27ET missiles. The export R-73E is just an export of the R-73 with a few extra degrees of off-bore, and the R-27ET is the longer range variant of the R-27T, similar to how the R-27ER is to the R-27R. It is a direct upgrade, comprised of the best of all worlds.
