Usage of CL-13B_Mk.6_(Germany): 
This aircraft is similar to the F-86A-5 in that it is equipped with leading-edge slats that improve turn rate and energy retention in a turn. However, the Mk.6 is equipped with a significantly more powerful engine. In fact, this improved engine means that unlike all other F-86 Sabres in the game, the Mk.6 is able to out-perform the MiG-17 in a climb, and as such is able to utilise vertical manoeuvres that would be a death sentence for any other Sabre. With a powerful engine, this plane can effectively use spiral-climbing in order to energy-trap MiGs. In fact, the Mk.6 has better speed, acceleration, and turn rate than all other Sabres (except the F-86F-40, which has a better turn rate).
