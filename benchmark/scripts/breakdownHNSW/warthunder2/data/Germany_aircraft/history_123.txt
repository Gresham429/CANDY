History of Fw_190_C: 
The Fw 190 C is an experimental high-altitude fighter powered by the DB-603 engine, developed from the same project that yielded the highly-effective Fw 190 D series aircraft. Designed to be a high-altitude interceptor, the Fw 190 C was designed with a unique power plant consisting of the DB 603 engine mated to an underslung turbocharger. While moderately successful, the Fw 190 C was never ordered into production, being superseded by the Fw 190 D and Ta 152 programs.
