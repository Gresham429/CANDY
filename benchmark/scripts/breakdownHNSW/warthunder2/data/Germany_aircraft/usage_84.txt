Usage of Me_410_B-1: 
This aircraft, like its predecessors, benefits from a large supply of ammo. When performing ground attacks against soft targets, firing the machine guns separately enables better conservation of the more relevant cannon ammo. It is recommended to use stealth ammo for the machine guns and another belt for the cannons that include tracers, as this enables the pilot to easier gauge the 20 mm's trajectory.
