Usage of IL-2_(1942)_(Germany): 
In Air RB, this aircraft can devastate entire columns of enemy tanks and soft targets with ease. The plane's 23 mm cannons' armour-piercing rounds will make easy work of enemy medium tanks when attacking from the sides, and can sometimes from the rear, though this seems to take more ammunition. It's recommended to use bursts when dealing with enemy armour. This aircraft can also excel in head-on attacks against enemy fighters, if needed for defensive actions. If using this plane with a squad of German IL-2s, one could potentially form a makeshift "circle of death", with each plane circling while covering the squad-mate ahead of them. If being attacked from behind, reducing power and flying low to the ground may cause the enemy fighter to overshoot into the player's firing zone.
