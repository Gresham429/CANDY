History of Fw_190_A-5/U2: 
The Fw 190 A-5/U2 was a modification of the Fw 190 A-5 used for ground attack during the night. Tests conducted in June 1943 were carried out with fairings attached to the engine cowling in order to dampen and obscure the exhaust flames, hiding the airplane in the night sky. An experimental A-5/U2 was flown in simulated attacks on a Ju-88A and it was discovered that the plane could only be seen at maximum engine power at high altitude.[1] Several airframes were then brought to the A-5/U2 standard with the modified engine cowling, ETC 250 bomb rack, provisions for 300L fuel tanks under the wings, a modified radio and a landing searchlight.[2]
