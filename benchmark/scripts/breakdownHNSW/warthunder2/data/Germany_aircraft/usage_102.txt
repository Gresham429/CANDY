Usage of Bf_109_K-4: 
The MK 108 is a double-edged sword: nicknamed by the allies for its characteristic sound, the Jackhammer lives true to its name: It is slow but powerful, with its main purpose being the demolition of heavy objects, such as the B-17G Flying Fortress. However, its common purpose in War Thunder remains to hunt fighter planes. The cannon's rate of fire is surprisingly high for its calibre with 660 rpm, meaning that, while deflection shots can be made, absolute trigger discipline must be maintained, since the 65 rounds will last you less than 6 seconds of continuous fire. Furthermore, the Minengescho√ü shells are very slow. One must either become very good at leading the shells or close the distance. Kills are generally done from 300 m away, if not closer. On the plus side, the damage is equivalent to most 37 mm cannons upon hitting. Tip: In order to better learn and understand the cannon's trajectory, do not fire in conjunction with the machine guns.
