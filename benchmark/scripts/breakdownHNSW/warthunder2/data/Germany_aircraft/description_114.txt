Description of Ju_188_A-2: 
The Ju 88 was one of Junkers' proposals for the Schnellbomber (high-speed bomber) program. It featured a unique airframe design and had relatively low drag compared to other bomber designs. Over the years, the Ju 88 went through multiple revisions and variants, such as the Ju 88 A-4. In 1939, the RLM issued a specification for a new line of Schnellbombers. Junkers submitted the Ju 88 B, which was an A-1 airframe fitted with much more powerful engines. Although the performance left much to be desired, work continued.
