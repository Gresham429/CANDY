Usage of Fw_190_A-8: 
The Fw 190 A-8 possesses below average speed, acceleration, and climb ability for its rank. It does, however, have great high-speed control and a wicked armament that will shred any fighter almost instantly. It is recommended that you climb to the side and let your teammates engage first so you can put your excellent BnZ ability to work. You should climb to either 3,000 m altitude or 5,000 m and wait for friendlies to engage enemy aircraft first. Don't forget to use your flaps in a dive as the A-8 gains a massive amount of speed in a dive, generally resulting in overshooting the target if he is distracted with a dogfight. Don't worry about your flaps breaking as they can survive speeds up to 900 km/h, far faster than you're ever going to go in combat.
