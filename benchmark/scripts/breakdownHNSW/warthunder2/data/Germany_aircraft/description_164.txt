Description of MiG-29G_(Germany): 
After the re-unification of Germany, the Luftwaffe liquidated or scrapped almost all of the Soviet-made NVA aircraft they had inherited. The notable exception were the MiG-29s, which not only were a valuable asset for NATO in dissimilar combat training, but as testing shortly afterwards showed, were superior to most fighters in service with NATO at the time. As such, it was decided to keep the MiG-29s in Luftwaffe service, and to extend their life by replacing parts and upgrading avionics to meet NATO standards and certifications. The resulting project was the MiG-29G. To integrate these aircraft into NATO operations, The MiG-29G had been upgraded with NATO-compatible communication and navigation systems, making it fully interoperable with NATO forces. The MiG-29G was also equipped with Western avionics. The aircraft was designed to operate in a multi-role capacity, capable of both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. This German MiG-29 variant, with its blend of Eastern airframe prowess and Western technology, represented a unique fusion of capabilities that set it apart from its older Soviet counterparts and made it a valuable asset for NATO.
