Description of MiG-21MF_(Germany): 
During the late '60s and early '70s, East Germany would start receiving second and third generation MiG-21 airframes to replace their aging MiG-21F-13 fleet. The primary upgrade among these was the MiG-21MF, standing for Modernizirovannyy Forsirovannyy (Modernized, Uprated) to denote the overhaul in avionics and the uprated engine of this type. This upgraded model, touting a different radar system over its predecessors, and an updated airframe shape with increased fuel load, and most importantly, armed with the deadly R-60 air-to-air missile, would form the backbone of the East German air force until the arrival of the MiG-21bis and later the MiG-23MF aircraft into the East German fleet.
