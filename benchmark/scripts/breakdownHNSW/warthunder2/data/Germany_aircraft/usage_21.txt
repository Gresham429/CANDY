Usage of BV_138_C-1: 
With a small bomb load of six 50 kg bombs, do not expect to play a big role in Air battles in terms of bombing; however the 20 mm and 13 mm defensive weapons makes up with a potent sting if attacked. Be familiar of the turret arcs, and fly low to cover your unprotected belly. The BV 138 can be used as a low-altitude slugger in Air RB where its powerful turret-based cannons are able to blast through any monoplane or biplane it may face at its BR. Uptiers with the BV 138 can be much more unforgiving with this tactic, but the potency of its defensive armament still remains.
