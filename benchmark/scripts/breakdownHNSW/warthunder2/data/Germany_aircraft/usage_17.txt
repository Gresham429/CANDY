Usage of Ju_87_G-2: 
Like other ground attack aircraft, the Ju 87 G is heavily armoured, tarnishing its flight characteristics. However, with enough speed, the Ju 87 G can turn on a dime. This is the case with all Ju 87 variants. Once that speed is gone, however, the Ju 87 turns painfully slowly. Mitigate this by using dive attacks to gain altitude. At higher altitudes, the Ju 87 G can be a fighter's nightmare. With enough speed and energy, a Ju 87 can outmanoeuvre most fighters. A Ju 87 G pilot's best chances of surviving an encounter are a good aim, teamwork, and speed. Boom & Zooming 10 m above the ground will make the Ju 87 G a very easy target, so one must stay at higher altitudes if they wish to survive a dogfight.
