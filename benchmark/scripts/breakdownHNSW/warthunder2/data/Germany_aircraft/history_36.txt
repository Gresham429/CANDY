History of Bf_109_E-3: 
The Bf 109 E-3 became the mainstream fighter of the German Luftwaffe between 1940 to 1941. Seeing some action in 1939, the E-3 was the most produced aircraft of the Emil series and much appreciated by pilots. While pilot comfort was not what one might call outstanding, German pilots held the Emil in high regard, due to its performance and offensive bite. Its improvements over the Bf 109 E-1 were a strengthening of the structural integrity and the integration of two-wing mounted MG FFs in the wings, replacing two MG 17s the earlier Emil carried. In order to save the 20 mm shell cases, the wing had a small empty container in which used casings were thrown into after firing of the weapon.
