Description of Me_410_A-1: 
The Me 410 was an evolution of the pre-war design of the Me 210. The planes looked quite similar but the Me 410 housed the much more powerful DB 603 engines which greatly improved the aircraft's performance. The Me 410 A-1 had its beginnings relatively late into the war. Production started in 1944 and the A-1 was intended to be a high-speed bomber. This was the result of the pre-war ideas that twin-engine aircraft could be both a fighter and a bomber. Needless to say, the Me 410 A-1 did not excel in its role as a bomber. It could only carry two 500 kg bombs and that was on the limit. The two 500 kg bombs barely fit and one of the bomb bay doors had to be left slightly open which increased drag.
