Usage of Bf_109_G-14: 
The Bf 109 G-14 is similar to the other 109s in terms of playstyle, having a few tweaked upgrades making it better than its predecessors and a similar ability like the Bf 109 G-10 to change its 20 mm nose cannon for a 30 mm one makes it have a different range of possibility to use the G-14 compared to the other 109s. The Bf 109 are dedicated fighters but can but used in a lot of roles in battles ranging from fighter role to bomber role, even though it got limited options on the latter choice it can be proven useful at them all.
