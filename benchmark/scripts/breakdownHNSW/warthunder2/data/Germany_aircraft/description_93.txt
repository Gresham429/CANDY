Description of Fw_190_A-5/U14: 
The Focke-Wulf 190 A was the first production series of the Fw 190. Many variants were developed, from the A-1 to the A-8. The A-5 had an extensive list of aircraft that were fitted with different "Umr√ºstbausatz" kits. Most included simple camera additions or weaponry changes, as was the case with the A-5/U14. The U14 was intended to utilize the LT F5b torpedo, which was mounted under the fuselage. For safety reasons, the tail wheel and fin height were increased so the torpedo could not accidentally strike the ground. As for armament, the A-5/U14 was only armed with two 20 mm MG 151 cannons mounted near the engine. Two planes were tested in this setup: "TD SI" (model shown in-game) and "TD SJ".
