Usage of Bf_109_G-2: 
The Bf 109 G-2 is very similar in performance to the Bf 109 G-2/trop. The major difference between the two is the Bf 109 G-2 is faster than its brother but it offers little to no support when facing allied (USA, Britain, USSR, etc.) opponents. It turns better than most aircraft in its tier and holds energy very well.
