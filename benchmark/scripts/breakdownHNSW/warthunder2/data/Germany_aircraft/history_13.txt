History of Hs_123_A-1: 
First flying in 1935, the Hs 123 was Henschel's response to the 1933 Reich Ministry requirement for a dive bomber. After the successful delivery of 250 aircraft its christening of fire began. In 1936 the Hs-123 was sent to Spain where its usefulness as a close air support aircraft was well known. Being able to accurately place its powerful bombload and reliability outweighed its short range and it saw extensive service in that role. After the beginning of World War 2, The Hs 123 saw service on the front-line airfields, where its quick turn time and ability to take heavy damage was appreciated by pilots and ground crews alike. Despite this, the Luftwaffe considered them obsolete, and most squadrons re-equipped to Stukas or Bf 109 E's (Jabo variant).
