Description of Me_264: 
The Me 264 was Messerschmitt's submission to the German Air Ministry's specification for a long-range heavy bomber. Hitler reportedly boasted to Mussolini that Germany would have bombers that could fly all the way to the east coast of the United States by 1941. Messerschmitt had thought of creating a long-range aircraft before and finally saw the Amerika Bomber project as a way to design and produce them. Messerschmitt had tough competition like Junkers and Dornier who had an immense amount of experience building bombers. The final design included four engines and had a range of around 7,000 miles (11,265 km). Eventually, the Me 264 failed to compete with the performance of competition like the Junkers 390, Junkers' proposal with six engines. The Kriegsmarine expressed interest in the project and planned to repurpose the Me 264 as a reconnaissance aircraft for the U-boats. However, Doenitz saw the failures of the program and managed to talk Hitler out of it. Finally, after the prototypes were damaged by the Allied bombing campaigns and constant setbacks, Hermann GÃ¶ring ordered work be stopped on the Me 264.
