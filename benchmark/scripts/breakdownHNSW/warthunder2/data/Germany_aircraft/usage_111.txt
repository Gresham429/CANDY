Usage of Me_262_A-1/U4: 
The main tactic to use against bombers is a head-on attack or a long-range shot. Aim for the large fuselage, as the 50 mm HEI-T shell will obliterate any plane it hits in one or two shots or will knock out the pilot. In a deflection shot from above, a 50 mm HEI-T to the wing almost always shreds the entire wing of the enemy or severely damages the wing to the extent a bomber will be unable to fly. A high dive from behind the bomber will offer the biggest and easiest target, but this should be avoided against the B-29.
