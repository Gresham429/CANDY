Usage of G.91_R/4_(Germany): 
Due to the G.91 R/4's notably lower speed and high-end acceleration as compared to its contemporaries, the R/4 should be played as a support fighter; meaning the pilot should seek to stick near teammates rather than hunting targets solo, and opt to pick off hostile aircraft that are engaged and distracted with/by allied fighters. The G.91 airframe is exceptionally agile, and the R/4 is no exception; even heavily manoeuvring targets are easy for this plane to keep the nose on. The plane's exceptional roll and turn rates are its biggest strengths, and the pilot should seek to use that to their advantage rather than attempting to fight speed or energy battles.
