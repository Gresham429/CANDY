Description of Bf_109_F-4: 
Dogfights over the English channel showed the Spitfire Mk. V outperforming the Bf 109 E at the time and led to the Bf 109 F series. The Bf 109 F "Franz" series was a significant improvement over the Bf 109 E. It featured the DB 601 E engine, which boasted an over 25% increase in power. The F-4 was also fitted with the MG 151/20 cannon, which was a 20 mm cannon that could fire a variety of shells. It was mounted through the propeller hub, so it didn't need to be synchronized with the prop, which would've most likely lowered the rate of fire. Over 1,800 F-4s were built, ranging from the regular fighter version (F-4) to reconnaissance variants like the F-4/R3. The Bf 109 F-4 also largely solved the issue with the Spitfire Mk. V having a performance edge over 109s.
