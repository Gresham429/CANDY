Usage of Bf_109_E-1: 
When fighting in the Bf 109, the player needs to understand the concept of energy and maintain energy superiority over their foe at all times, while also keeping an eye on their surroundings and incoming bandits. To do this, use speed and altitude to your advantage, constantly shifting between the two in a fight. This calls for discipline on the side of the pilot, as you will often be tempted to bleed away speed or forgo attempts at gaining back altitude in hopes for a few more shots on targets. As your experience with the Emil grows, you will be able to more reliably judge when you can bleed speed/forsake altitude to obtain a positional advantage and when not to, but newer players with a too gung-ho attitude often get themselves into more trouble than they can handle.
