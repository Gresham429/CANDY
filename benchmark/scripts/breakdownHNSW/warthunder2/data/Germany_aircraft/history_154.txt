History of MiG-21MF_(Germany): 
The MiG-21MF (Germany) is a second-generation variant of the popular MiG-21 'Fishbed'. Operated by the East German Air Force (Luftstreitkr√§fte der Nationalen Volksarmee; LSK) between 1972 and 1990, the aircraft was an export variant of the MiG-21SM, and is highly similar to its counterpart, the MiG-21SMT. Designated the 'Fishbed-J', the aircraft formed the bulk of the LSK in the late stages of the Cold War. All German MiG-21 aircraft were retired following the German Reunification, though some survive as museum aircraft to this day.[1][2]
