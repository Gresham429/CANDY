Description of MiG-23BN_(Germany): 
Following adoption of the MiG-23B ground-attack variant of the MiG-23, Mikoyan OKB quickly set out to modernize and upgrade the aircraft where possible. The first of these many upgrades was the MiG-23BN variant, with the main difference being the usage of the Type 3 wings of the MiG-23ML and an upgraded variant of the R-29 engine. The BN variant saw almost no use with the Soviets, instead being a very popular export model to both Warsaw Pact and Third World customers. During the mid-late '70s, the East German airforce received 18 MiG-23BNs, especially modified by removal of the dielectric fairings, and received without any countermeasure dispensers. These aircraft would serve in the forefront of the ground attack roles alongside the Su-22 aircraft used by the East German air force.
