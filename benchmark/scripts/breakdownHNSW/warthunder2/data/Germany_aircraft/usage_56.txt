Usage of He_111_H-6: 
The second of the He 111 series in the German aviation tree, the He 111 H-6 compares to its predecessor, the H-3, with new Jumo 211F engines which gives a substantial improvement in horsepower. Another improvement is in defensive armament in ammo load and positions. The overall aircraft now holds a total 6,375 rounds of available rounds for all seven machine guns, with the majority of the machine guns holding more rounds per load. Defensive gun arcs are improved with the addition of a tail turret to ward off trailing enemies.
