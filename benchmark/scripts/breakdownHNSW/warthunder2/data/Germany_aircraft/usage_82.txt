Usage of Me_410_B-1/U2: 
This plane is great for capturing airfields because you can use it to approach very close to the ground and very, very fast up to the very last moment. This is because of the Hornisse's effective airbrake. When running towards the runway, don't hesitate to put the pedal to the metal up to really shortly before touchdown, then push off the airbrake, gear and all flaps (in that order). Ignore all warning and try to touch-down with about 200-240 km/h.
