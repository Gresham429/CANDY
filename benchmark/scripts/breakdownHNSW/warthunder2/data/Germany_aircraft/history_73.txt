History of Bf_110_C-6: 
The Bf 110 C-6 is a twin-engine heavy attack aircraft developed according to a special programme whose objective was to outfit the Bf 110 fighters with a heavy cannon armament. This modification came into existence in the spring of 1939. The aircraft was designed to be equipped with a 30 mm MK 101 cannon, while its standard-issue 20 mm cannons were dismantled for the purposes of reducing the weight and increasing fuselage space. A series of issues concerning the manufacturing of the MK 101 cannons led to the postponement of the project, but in the summer of 1940, the German government placed an order to assemble a test batch consisting of 12 C-6 aircraft. All the fighters in this batch were deployed in the Battle of France as anti-tank aircraft, as well as in the Battle of Britain to combat enemy ships and destroy enemy radars.
