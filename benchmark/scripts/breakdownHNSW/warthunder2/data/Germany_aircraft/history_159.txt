History of F-4F_Early_(Germany): 
In the early 1970s, West Germany was searching for a new aircraft. Multiple aircraft were considered, such as a single-seat version of the F-4, but that version of the F-4 was succeeded by the F-5 and the project lost steam in the 60s. It became active again in the early '70s when the West German government was planning to acquire single-seat Phantoms designated the F-4E(F). However, this procurement fell through and the government eventually finalized its decision with the 2-seater F-4E. The project was focused on making it lighter and inexpensive compared to the normal F-4E. As such, the AN/APQ-120 was simplified by removing functions for radar missiles, the rear-most fuel tank was removed, the tailplane was unslotted, and it also lacked any capability to use guided weaponry. These modifications meant the F-4F was more than 3,000 pounds (1,360 kg) lighter than a normal F-4E and significantly cheaper.
