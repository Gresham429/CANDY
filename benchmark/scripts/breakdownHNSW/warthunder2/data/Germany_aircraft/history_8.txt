History of He_112_A-0: 
The Heinkel He 112 was a monoplane fighter designed for the 1933 Luftwaffe competition. Drawing on its experience with the He 70 mail plane, Heinkel incorporated features that were new to fighters at the time. The construction was all-metal with stressed skin and the inverted "gull" wings had an elliptical shape. The landing gear was retractable and mounted in the bends of the gull wings. The end result was a sleek and modern aircraft with good cockpit visibility and superior speed to the biplane fighters that the Luftwaffe was equipped with at the time. However, it faced stiff competition from Messerschmitt's Bf 109. The two planes had comparable performance. While the He 112 had better turning capabilities due to its lower wing loading, the Bf 109 was faster and accelerated better. The choice between the two aircraft was not easy for the Luftwaffe and orders were placed for limited pre-production runs of both. The Bf 109 won out in the end for several reasons: it completed testing with minimal complications whereas the He 112 suffered from several crashes, and it was also easier to manufacture than Heinkel's offering. The Bf 109's straight and largely rectangular wings were far simpler than the He 112's elliptical gull wings, for example. The development would continue for the Bf 109 and it would eventually become the Luftwaffe's most numerous and iconic World War II fighter.
