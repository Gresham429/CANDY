Description of Sea_Hawk_Mk.100_(Germany): 
In 1956, the British Air Ministry cancelled production of the Hawker Sea Hawk in favour of newer aircraft. At this time, the Federal Republic of Germany were attempting to increase their naval aircraft inventory both looking for a daytime fighter-bomber and also an all-weather version. After comparing aircraft produced by other countries, the Bundesmarine concluded that the Hawker Sea Hawk fit their requirements and ordered 32 of each variant, the Mk.100, and Mk.101 with an underwing search radar pod.
