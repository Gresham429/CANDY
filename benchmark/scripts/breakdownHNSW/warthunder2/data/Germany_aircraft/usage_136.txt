Usage of Me_262_A-1a/U1: 
As a modified Me 262 A-1a, its role in the battle has not changed that much. The added cannons (namely, the MK 103) make the plane more capable at its battle rating. The MK 103s can carry an ammo belt that has the capability of penetrating the roofs of some tanks when playing in Ground Realistic battles. It is advisable to fire each pair of cannons separately, because all of its autocannons have a different muzzle velocity (about 200 m/s) and different amounts of ammunition. MK 108s will run dry first, followed by the MK 103s, and lastly the MG 151s.
