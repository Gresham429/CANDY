Description of Me_410_B-6/R3: 
The Me 410 B-6/U3 was the naval variant of the Zerstӧrer. Its main mission was to escort German warships and vessels like the U-boat arm. For communication purposes, the FuG 200 “Zaunkӧnig” radio system was used to help talk to U-boats. In addition to the two MG 151 cannons, two MK 103 30 mm cannons were also fitted. Only a handful were actually produced so their impact was negligible; especially when the Germans lost France. Me 410 B-6s were then relegated to rescue missions and a few were found by the British.
