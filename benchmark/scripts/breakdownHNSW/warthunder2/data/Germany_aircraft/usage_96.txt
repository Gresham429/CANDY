Usage of P-47D_(Germany): 
As with the other P-47s in-game, the most recommended strategy for this aircraft is using Boom & Zoom tactics. Using this strategy, you may need to side-climb to get into a viable position, given that Allied aircraft will usually be at a higher altitude than you. It is highly recommended to not try and turn with the aircraft you are trailing, as you will quickly lose energy and become vulnerable. Instead, you can initiate a relatively steep climb after your first pass. This will allow you to once again take the altitude advantage over the enemy and give you further opportunities for 'BnZ'ing. When climbing back up, however, it is advisable to pay attention to what aircraft may be around. You may become a free kill for anyone in the vicinity if you are not aware of what is around.
