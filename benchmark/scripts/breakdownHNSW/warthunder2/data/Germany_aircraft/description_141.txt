Description of CL-13A_Mk_5_(Germany): 
In 1949, Canada wanted a new fighter to supplement its growing air force. The F-86 Sabre was a good option, but the Canadian government didn't want to have another American aircraft in service. As a compromise, Canada received a license to build their own Sabres and thus birthed the Canadair Sabre. At first, they were essentially the same as the US F-86A. As development and production continued, Canadair Sabres were growing different and even had their own engine installed, the Avro Orenda jet engine. The Mk5 was powered by the Orenda 10, fitted with a new wing, and other aerodynamic changes. It was close to the US F-86F-30 in terms of performance. During this time, the German Luftwaffe was revived and also looked to purchase modern aircraft. Germany placed an order for over 200 Mk6 Sabres, but as a stop-gap measure, 75 ex-RCAF Mk5 Sabres were also supplied. Many of the Mk5 Sabres were scrapped in 1962.
