Usage of Bf_109_E-7/U2: 
The main armament is identical to that of the Bf 109 E-3. However, there is one critical difference. The MG FF/M can fire Minengescho√ü shells. Mine shells have a thin shell, allowing more incendiary material to be used; however the very same characteristics prevent these shells to be fired from older MG FF versions (like on the predecessor, E-3). Thus, the MGFF/Ms are far more powerful than the MG FFs.
