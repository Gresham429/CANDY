Usage of G.91_R/3_(Germany): 
Achieving air superiority should be the primary task for all G.91 pilots. However, the G.91 R/3 excels in a support role, especially in uptiers, where most of enemies can simply run away from it. To do this, take 9 min of fuel to boost its acceleration and climb rate (the low ammo count will discourage prolonged air combat anyways), and after takeoff climb at around 8Â° (680-700 km/h). When the first enemies engage with allies, go over them and find target with low energy state and destroy it. Do not chase lonely planes, as although enemy might look like easy 1-v-1 victory, the low top speed makes it very hard to catch somebody. Try not to engage in a prolonged dogfight, because the G.91 R/3 has rather poor energy retention and when caught slow even good acceleration won't save the plane. Also, keep in mind that the G.91 R/3 has poor low speed performance because of swept wings and lack of leading edge slats. In prolonged turn fight, one may find themselves losing even against jets like the MiG-15. Another thing is do not air brake. The G.91 R/3's below average energy retention combined with overall good manoeuvrability makes it easy enough for pilot to evade enemy, and in combat, even the good acceleration is not enough to regain the lost speed.
