Description of Ta_152_H-1: 
The German Air Ministry needed a high-altitude fighter to counter the Allied bombing campaigns. Kurt Tank, a notable German engineer, developed the Ta 152 which was heavily based upon the existing Fw 190 "Dora" series of aircraft. Three variants of the Ta 152 were developed but the H variant was the high-altitude fighter needed to defend German skies from bombers. Elements of the 190 Dora's airframe are clearly present on the 152 H such as the fuselage but the wings were elongated and the fuselage was stretched. In addition, the Jumo 213E engine utilized methanol-water injection (MW-50) as well as GM-1 boost. Coupled with the two-stage supercharger, the Ta 152 H could reach an impressive 755 km/h (472 mph) and an exceptional service ceiling of 14,500+ metres (47,000+ feet). This was a significant improvement over the Fw 190 D-9 and was one of the fastest propeller-driven aircraft of World War Two.
