Usage of Hunter_F.58_(Germany): 
The Hunter F.58 is a transonic aircraft in level flight but can reach supersonic speed in a dive (but rated at exactly M1.0 before structural failure). That means that it is faster than other subsonic aircraft (one of the fastest subsonic jet, just behind the duo "Jump-jet": Yak-38M and US Harriers) it will face, but slower than early supersonic aircraft like the F-100D and the MiG-19PT. Thanks to the upgrades by Swiss in 1964, the F.58 received more self-defense equipment such as all-aspect RWR and 60 countermeasures onboard - it can be said that the jet is old but not obsolete.
