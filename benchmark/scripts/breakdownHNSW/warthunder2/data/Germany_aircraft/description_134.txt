Description of Ar_234_C-3: 
After constant reliability issues with the Junkers Jumo 004 engine, a test flight was conducted with the BMW 003 engine. Although it had less thrust than the Jumo, it was significantly lighter and helped improve the thrust-to-weight ratio. This led to a variant called the Ar 234 C. The C featured airframe improvements, better cockpit visibility, and most importantly, the addition of four BMW 003 engines, two mounted under each wing. The new engines and airframe improvements greatly increased the top speed to an astounding 857 km/h (535 mph). Unfortunately for Germany, it was in complete disarray and only a handful Ar 234 Cs were produced and even fewer were in active service.
