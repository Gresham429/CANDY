Usage of Fw_190_A-5/U12: 
At the beginning of a battle, it is preferable to climb slightly to the sides to ensure that you have the altitude advantage over the enemy without having to encounter them head-on in a low energy climb state, while staying close enough to the engagement to intervene once they appear. Like all Fw 190s, the turn rate of the A-5/U12 is abysmal compared to most other aircraft you will meet, so out-turning opponents should not be attempted. However, the short wings on the plane are do give it an advantage over similar craft at its BR in terms of strength, and can easily survive several magnitudes of G-force - which is one of the few options available to the A-5/U12 for defence. Vertical engagements and energy retention are a must.
