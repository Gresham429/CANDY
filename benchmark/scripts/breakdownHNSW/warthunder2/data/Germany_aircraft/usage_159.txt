Usage of F-4F_Early_(Germany): 
The aircraft is pretty heavy, rather quick in acceleration and top speed and doesn't have the best turn time. Its armament, however, is impressive. With the gun pod modification equipped, you'll fire enough lead downrange to destroy any air target. Using the phantom as a turnfighter is generally ill-advised. Therefore, try to ambush a unsuspecting enemy. Even the single 20 mm cannon will give any foe a fiery end.
