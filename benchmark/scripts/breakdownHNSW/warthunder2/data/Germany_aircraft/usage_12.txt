Usage of Do_217_J-2: 
The Do 217 J-2 is identical to the Do 217 J-1 in most aspects but moved up in battle rating (besides Arcade). The increase in battle rating exacerbates the already subpar performance of the J-1. In terms of climb rate, turn rate, energy retention, and compression, the Do 217 J-2 is outperformed by almost every aircraft it will face, even some enemy bombers. However, the nose-mounted radar affords the J-2 unique opportunities compared to its predecessor.
