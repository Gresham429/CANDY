Usage of He_162_A-1: 
Bomber-hunting
The He 162 A-1 with its 30 mm cannons should be played in a bomber-hunting role as intended in its historical onset. This also plays into the power and flaws of the 30 mm as a bomber's larger profile and lesser mobility can allow for more 30 mm shells to hit with a pass.
