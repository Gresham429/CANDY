History of Ar_234_C-3: 
After successful tests were completed, the BMW 003 engine was deemed to be an improvement over the unreliable Junkers Jumo 004. The new generation of the Ar 234, the Ar 234 C, would be fitted with four BMW 003 engines with two mounted under each wing. In addition to the engine upgrade, the Ar 234 C also featured better cockpit visibility and better aerodynamics. This greatly increased the top speed and range of the 234 C over the B variant.
