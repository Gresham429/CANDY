History of Bf_109_G-10: 
The Bf 109 G-10 was a variant of the already successful Bf 109 series. The G-10 was the combination of a Bf 109 G airframe with a DB605 D-2 Engine, the aircraft was built in the factories of Erla, WNF, and Messerschmitt Regensburg. Even though being called a G-10, the aircraft was in production after the G-14, the sole purpose was to produce a fighter better than the G-14 until the K-4 could take its place.
