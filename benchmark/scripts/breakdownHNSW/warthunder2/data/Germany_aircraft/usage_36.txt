Usage of Bf_109_E-3: 
Just as the with the E-1, new players should adopt a hit-and-run tactic with the Bf 109s (also known as Boom-and-Run). While often called a Boom & Zoom aircraft, the Bf 109s are not dedicated Boom & Zoomers, and many other aircraft such as the Fw 190 do it much better. While it is true that a pure Boom and Zooming approach can be used for the Bf 109s, limiting oneself to this enormously undermines the plane's efficiency.  That said, the Bf 109s do build up speed quickly in a dive, and they have a respectable zoom climb that ends in a strongly sustained climb at ~270 km/h (optimal climbing speed 260, and dash 280 km/h). Doing so will often give the player the maximum speed or altitude advantage they can have over their chosen target. A straight-up bounce, with a short extend from the target and a slowly increasing climb leading into an Immelmann, tends to work best for rookie pilots. Remember to check your six and surroundings during the climb and just before diving back onto the target. Don't forget to try and gain altitude but only up to 3,000 m is recommended but 4,000 m is the limit as anything higher will cause you controls to stiffen and "buckle out" meaning turn rate will get considerably slow and bombers at that altitude will be able to easily outrun you.
