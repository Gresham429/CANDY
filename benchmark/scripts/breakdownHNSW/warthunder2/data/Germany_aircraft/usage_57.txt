Usage of He_111_H-16: 
In Arcade, try to maximize altitude upon spawning; this will make it harder for most fighters to reach you in the early moments (only for ground strike). However, this leaves your poorly defended underbelly open to most attacks, so a fighter with a decent engine could easily catch up and take you down. When engaging this bomber, don't worry about the gunners, as they have a very restricted field of, allowing an attack from these angles: 10-2 o'clock high or even 8 o'clock high/5 o'clock high, as well as 9-3 o'clock low or 10 o'clock low/2 o'clock low, as the gunners, cannot reach you there.
