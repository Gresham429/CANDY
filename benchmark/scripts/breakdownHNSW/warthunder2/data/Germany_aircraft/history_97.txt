History of La-5FN_(Germany): 
In early 1942, Semyon Lavochkin's LaGG-3 fighter was under threat of having its production cancelled, having shown itself to be underpowered and overweight. At the same time, Arkady Shvetsov faced a lack of demand for his M-82 radial engine - another project also in danger of being cancelled - successfully used only by the Sukhoi OKB's Su-2 ground attack aircraft. The two designers met at a conference in Moscow, and Shvetsov agreed to help Lavochkin fit the M-82 engine to the LaGG-3 airframe. Mikhail Gudkov, one of the original designers of the LaGG-3, had already attempted to do the such a thing resulting in the Gu-82 fighter, but he had delayed getting the fighter into production for too long. By April 1942, Aleksander Yakovlev had succeeded in getting his Yak-7 fighter produced instead of the LaGG-3, effectively monopolising Soviet fighter aircraft production.
