Description of Fw_190_A-8: 
The Focke-Wulf 190 A-8 is one of the later variants of the "Anton". By 1944, the Allied bombing campaign was at an all-time high, and German aircraft were constantly receiving new changes intended for high-altitude performance. The 190 A-8 was a fairly significant improvement over the previous A-7. Additions included a 115-liter tank for increased range, more armament, and the all-important GM-1 boost. GM-1 was quite important for high-altitude fighters where the air is much thinner than at sea level. It utilized nitrous oxide, which was compressed into a liquid and stored in a tank behind the pilot. At high altitude, nitrous oxide would be injected via the intake and was able to increase power for about 10 minutes before the tank was empty. GM-1 boost is different from MW 50: MW 50 systems inject a mix of water and methanol to cool the supercharger and air coming into the combustion chamber. Over 6,600 A-8 variants were produced at various factories, and many saw use against bomber formations.
