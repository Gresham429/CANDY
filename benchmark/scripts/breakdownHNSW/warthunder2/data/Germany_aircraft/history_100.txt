History of Bf_109_G-14: 
In 1943, the Bf 109 G-6 entered service, while its performance was less than stellar, its worth derived from the ability to be easily modified into dedicated fighter bomber, high altitude interceptor or reconnaissance. likewise, great care was taken to make sure the G6 could fit heavy armament for attacking bombers, which were beginning to appear in force over Germany, and the shortcoming of the Fw 190s at high altitude became increasingly apparent.
