Description of CL-13B_Mk.6_(Germany): 
In 1949, Canada wanted a new fighter to supplement its growing air force. The F-86 Sabre was a good option, but the Canadian government didn't want to have another American aircraft in service. As a compromise, Canada received a license to build their own Sabres and thus birthed the Canadair Sabre. At first, they were essentially the same as the US F-86A. As development and production continued, Canadair Sabres were growing different and even had their own engine installed, the Avro Orenda jet engine. Many variants of the Canadair Sabre were built, but the last variant was the Mk 6. It was quite similar to the Mk 5, except in engines: the Mk 6 was powered by the Orenda 14 engine. It provided a 14% increase in thrust and greatly improved the Mk 6's performance. The climb rate, top speed, and service ceiling were all improved. It would be one of the best-performing Sabres and was delivered to many countries, including Germany. The last Canadair Sabre was built for Germany and marked the end of production. Germany received over 200 Mk 6 Sabres and would later be modified to launch AIM-9B Sidewinders.
