Usage of Do_217_N-1: 
The Do 217 N-1 is yet another "Zerst√∂rer" heavy fighter in the German tech tree. It is functionally a Do 217 J-2 with the MG FF/M cannons having been replaced with the faster firing, high velocity 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons. With that being said however, it has the exact same strengths and weaknesses as the J-2. That's to say it has an amazing armament for its battle rating, but lacks the manoeuvrability and speed to use it effectively, especially in a dogfight.
