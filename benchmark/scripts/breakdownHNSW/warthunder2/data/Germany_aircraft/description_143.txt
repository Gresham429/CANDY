Description of F-86K_(Germany): 
The F-86K Sabre (also known as "Sabre Dog" or "Dog Sabre") is a first-generation American interceptor fighter developed by North American in 1953. The first prototype, YF-86K, took to the skies on July 15, 1954. It was produced in the United States and Italy (at the Fiat factories), with 120 and 221 aircraft manufactured, respectively. Widely exported to NATO member countries as an interceptor, the aircraft was originally intended to be designated as the F-95A. However, the conclusion of the Korean War forced the designers to use the already well-established F-86 designation to secure funding from Congress. Nevertheless, only about 25% of the original F-86 components and assemblies remained in the F-86K. The aircraft underwent significant improvements in terms of armament and electronics, and it received a new engine equipped with an afterburner, which greatly enhanced its flight performance. The West German Luftwaffe would acquire 86 F-86K from the Fiat factories.
