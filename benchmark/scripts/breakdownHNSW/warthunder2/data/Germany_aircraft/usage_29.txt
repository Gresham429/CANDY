Usage of C._200_serie_3_(Germany): 
The M.C 200 is a fairly typical pre-war Italian design, moderate speed combined with good rates of turning, and high-speed tolerance while maintaining good controls at all speeds. Furthermore, the MC 200 is a capable climber, easily matching a lot of planes that it will regularly meet in its BR range. Further, it's fairly tough, capable of taking hits and returning to the airfield for repairs. However, it does have its issues as well, most notably the poor engine power which results in poor acceleration and, much like all Italian designs, it suffers from poor armament as well, although given the lower BR than the Folgore, this is less of an issue. Furthermore, as of 1.55, its payload is not modelled, so it doesn't carry bombs, meaning it's a poor ground attacker, being only able to harm soft Ground targets.
