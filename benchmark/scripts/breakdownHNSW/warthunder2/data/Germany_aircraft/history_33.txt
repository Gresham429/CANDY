History of Fw_189_A-1: 
Around 1937, the German Air Ministry wanted a short-ranged, three-seated reconnaissance plane with great visibility act as an army co-operation aircraft. Two aircraft manufacturers wanted the contract: Arado and Focke-Wulf (Blohm & Voss participated but it was a private venture). The Fw 189 prototype had an unusual twin-boom twin engine design so that there would be no engine blocking the front of the cockpit which offered maximum visibility and good speed. It was powered by two Argus As 410 engines and utilized a heavily glazed "stepless" cockpit; an all glass windscreen for the pilot to improve vision, which is similar to cockpits found on most German medium bombers. It was extremely successful not only because it was fast, but also because it was an extremely manoeuvrable aircraft. One trick utilized when a fighter came to intercept it was to start turning in a tight circle, which the pursuing fighter could not match. Later in the war, this aircraft was retrofitted for a variety of tasks which included light ground attack and a night fighter variant.
