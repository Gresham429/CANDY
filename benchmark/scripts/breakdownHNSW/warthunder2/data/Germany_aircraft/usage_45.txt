Usage of Bf_110_C-7: 
What the Bf 110 C-7 cannot do is turn fight, and this is where a lot of players make a fatal mistake. Heavy fighters cannot manoeuvre like a single engine fighter, it has an unusually poor roll rate and loses energy fast, and can unexpectedly snap-roll: rudder control is critical. It is a pure "Boom & Zoom" fighter and like others of its ilk, live by 2 rules: "Speed is Life, Altitude is Life Insurance", and "Turn to engage (fire at), not follow". Manoeuvres that retain your energy are key, keep your speed and/or altitude up. The 110 really shines in bomber attack or bomber escort where you will have positional advantage and gun solution first.
