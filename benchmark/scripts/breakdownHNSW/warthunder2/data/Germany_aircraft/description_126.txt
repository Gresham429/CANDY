Description of Me_262_C-2b: 
To combat constant Allied bomber raids, the need for a high-performance interceptor was at an all-time high. Many proposals and designs were made and one of those designs was the Me 262 C-2b, a variant based on the Me 262 A series fitted with rocket boosters. Nicknamed the "Home Defender", it would retain the two normal turbojets with the addition of two rocket boosters, one mounted on top of each engine exhaust. Although the idea was thought of in 1943, it would take two years for the only 262 C-2b prototype to take flight in March 1945. During the test flight, it boasted an incredible climb rate and was able to reach 30,000 feet (9,100 metres) in three minutes. However, the Me 262 C-2b arrived far too late into the war.
