Description of Me_410_B-1: 
The Me 410 B variant was intended to improve on the Me 410 A with better engines. DB 603G engines were planned to be installed, but production and design issues meant the DB 603G would never be put into any aircraft. Thus, the Me 410 B was essentially just a Me 410 A but with more fuel, strengthened undercarriage, and an oxygen system for high-altitude flight. The Me 410 B-1 was designed quite early in the war, when the Luftwaffe was still utilizing the Me 410 as a high-speed bomber. Thus, it could still carry bombs and lacks the additional cannons of later variants. However, once the Luftwaffe realized the Me 410 was weak as a bomber, its purpose shifted towards converting the Me 410 B-1s in service to the Zerst√∂rer standard. This usually resulted in more cannons being added.
