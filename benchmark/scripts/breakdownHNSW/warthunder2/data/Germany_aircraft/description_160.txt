Description of MiG-21_%22Lazur-M%22_(Germany): 
In the mid 1970s, the East German Airforce would start receiving their first MiG-21bis aircraft, to update their fighter-interceptor fleet from the aging MiG-21MFs and PFMs. East Germany would receive exactly 46 of the type, with 14 of them being the "Fishbed-L" variant, equipped with the Lazur-M GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) guidance system. The other 32 would be the "Fishbed-N" variant, equipped with the Polyot-OI guidance system instead. To differentiate the two variants, the aircraft received unique names in East German service, being called the MiG-21bis Lazur-M and the MiG-21bis-SAU respectively.
