Description of Lim-5P_(Germany): 
In 1955, Poland bought the license to produce the Soviet MiG-17 (and all its subsequent variants) indigenously. The aircraft received the designation Licencyjny My≈õliwiec ("Licensed Fighter") 5, or just Lim-5 for short. One variant in particular appeared in 1956, being a licensed copy of the MiG-17PF equipped with not only an afterburning variant of the VK-1 engine, but also the RP-5 Izumrud radar system in the nose. This variant was named the Lim-5P, and 129 were built in this variant before production of the Lim-5 ceased in 1960 in favour of the upgraded Lim-6. The Polish Lim-5s were exported to many countries due to their cheaper price than the Soviet originals, seeing service with countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Warsaw Pact. The most interesting user of the Lim-5 was Guinea-Bissau, a very small country on the Western coast of Africa. While there isn't much known about how the ex-German Lim-5Ps ended up in an African country in the '80s, Guinea-Bissau continued using these Lim-5Ps until 2011.
