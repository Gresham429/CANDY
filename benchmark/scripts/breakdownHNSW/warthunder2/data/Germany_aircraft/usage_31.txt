Usage of C._202_(Germany): 
The most important things the Folgore needs are Speed and Altitude. It's generally a good idea to climb to at least 5,000 - 6,000 m before levelling out and gaining speed. From there on, it's Boom and Zoom, working your way from top to bottom. Priority should be given to P-39 Airacobras, F6F Hellcats and the early Spitfire, as these are hard to beat if they are allowed to engage on their terms. The Hellcat is a considerable problem for the Folgore, due to the fact it's considerably faster and climbs only slightly worse. The best way of dealing with them is to fight them at speeds above 400 km/h (250 mph), where the Hellcat begins to stiffen up, but you retain your very good roll rate, which you can use to spoil his gun solution by constantly changing direction.
