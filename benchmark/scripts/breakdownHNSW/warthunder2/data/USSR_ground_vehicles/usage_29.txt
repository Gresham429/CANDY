Usage of KV-1_(L-11): 
The first thing to know about the tank, just because it's a heavy tank does not mean you should charge headfirst into the enemy. While it may look intimidating as you watch the enemy's shells deflect off your vehicle as you move slightly forward to their front lines, you risk getting flanked as moving forward gives the enemy enough space to get around and hit you in the vulnerable rear area. Try to avoid letting the enemy get close enough to catch your turret ring and destroy each of your crew from there. Thankfully, the turret ring is quite a small target, and will be difficult to hit from far away. Despite the 75 mm all-around armour, don't think for a second that you are invulnerable and play smart still. Also, angling is quite important, as many of the Axis long-barreled 75 mm will penetrate you.
