Usage of T-62: 
The T-62 is the first entry in the new stage of Soviet MBTs that most Soviet Tankers will research. As usual with soviet MBTs, only the turret has armour to speak of. Do not let this put you off as the T-62's 115 mm U-5TS is able to perform exceptionally even in an uptier. In fact, the U-5TS has more penetration than what comes after it, the T-55A, making a lot of players fall back to it (not to mention you lose the cool shell dump animation!). This comes at the cost of slightly slower reload time of 12.0s (9.2s if maxed crew), which is a little below average for its BR. All in all, the T-62 will give Soviet Tankers a general idea of how to play upcoming MBTs, as the playstyle doesn't change much.
