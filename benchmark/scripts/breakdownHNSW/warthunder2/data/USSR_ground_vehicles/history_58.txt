History of KV-85: 
During World War II, the USSR developed the KV-85 (originally known as Object 239) as an interim heavy tank solution to counter the emerging German Wehrmacht Panther medium tank. The Panther is a ground-breaking design that provides an excellent balance of mobility, protection, and firepower. It proved to be more than a match for the early T-34 medium tank.
