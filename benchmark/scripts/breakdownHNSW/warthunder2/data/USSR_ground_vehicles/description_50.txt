Description of SU-76D: 
The SU-76D (unrelated to the SU-76M) was a proposed Soviet tank destroyer that was based on the chassis of the T-70 light tank. As the name designates, it was powered by a 110 hp diesel engine. It was following the idea of light tank destroyers, which were small, mobile, and designed for quick strikes with a powerful gun. However, it failed to meet two of the criteria, as the SU-76D's main armament was a 76.2 mm gun, the same as that found on early T-34s, but it was no longer powerful enough to pierce the armour of more advanced German tanks, and the engine's power was insufficient for the vehicle. On top of that, the vehicle had problems with fine-tuning of the domestic engine. Thus, all work on it was halted, and the SU-76D was never mass produced.
