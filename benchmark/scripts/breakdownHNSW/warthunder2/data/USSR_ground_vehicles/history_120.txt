History of T-62: 
The T-62 was a further development of the T-55 tank series, featuring the same hull and hull components but improving the turret and firepower. It was the first Soviet tank to utilize a smoothbore cannon. After the successful prototyping and service of the T-54 and T-55, the Soviet MoD looked forward to improve the tanks by the end of the '50s. The T-62 was born of the of Object 430, a prototype from the T-54 which was heavily modified, mainly turret armour shape and thickness, increasing armour from 185 mm to 240 mm proportional to the turret's shape. It featured an improved version of the T-55A's D-10TS, the D-54TS. This project was designated officially as T-54M but was abandoned after prototype stages. Later, on the late 1950s, Uralvagonzavod built the Object 140, featuring the exact same hull but with a 6 road wheel suspension, same turret and gun. Prototype stages shown the unreliability of said vehicle due to the maintenance and expensive systems. Forced to abandon it, in 1958, Uralvagonzavod opted on modernizing the turret of the Object 140 fitting it with a case ejector and mounting it on a T-55 chassis. Due to the increased weight and proportion of the turret, a suspension redesign was inevitable. This prototype was designated Object 165 which was later set on trials in November 1958. It was accepted and serviced in 1962 under the name of T-62A. Later on the year, Uralvagonzavod opted to recalibre the 100 mm D-45TS gun in order to become a greater threat. It featured an increase in calibre from 100 mm to 115 mm, removal of rifling, increase in length, removal of muzzle brake and adding of a bore evacuator at the middle of the gun and addition of an automatic case ejector. This gun was designated U-5TS.
