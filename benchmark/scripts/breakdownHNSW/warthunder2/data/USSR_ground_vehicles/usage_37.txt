Usage of GAZ-MM_(72-K): 
While it is equipped with a 25 mm cannon, playing this vehicle in an anti-tank role should be situational only and not by design. It is a SPAA and should be used as such. With a sluggish mobility off-road and a paper-thin armour, it is recommended to always stay close to cover to protect the vehicle from enemy aircraft strafing runs. Only expose the truck's platform with the gun ideally when facing aircraft and engage them with OZR-132 belt. All belts contain tracers so be aware that once you fire, enemies will know your position. Wait until the enemy aircraft is close enough to engage (below 700 m) so that it has a reduced chance to evade fire. The most difficult part is leading the target to make a successful hit, as it depends on the plane's distance and speed. The tracer bullets are helpful for that purpose. Fire short bursts of 3 to 4 rounds and correct your aim based on the visual feedback.
