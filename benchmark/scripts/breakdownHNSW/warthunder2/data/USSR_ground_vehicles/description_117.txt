It introduces a more capable 57 mm autocannon, capable of firing the same shells as the ZSU-57-2, night vision devices, and an upgraded two-plane stabilizer. The new BM-57 turret houses the 57 mm AU-220M autocannon. With new armour-piercing shells capable of penetrating modern APCs and IFVs. The gun is also capable of engaging aerial targets in low-level flight from up to 6 kilometres. Mobility has been greatly increased with the addition of a new transmission, a more powerful engine with a power to weight ratio of 20 hp/ton, and new tracks that reduce driver fatigue. Survivability was also increased with modern fast-acting firefighting systems. The modernization also includes modern 1P67 and "Liga-S" optics for better target acquisition.
