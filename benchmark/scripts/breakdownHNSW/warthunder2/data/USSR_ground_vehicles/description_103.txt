Description of T-54_(1951): 
The T-54 Model 1951 is the third variant of the T-54 main battle tank family. Produced from 1952 to 1954, the T-54 Model 1951 variant used the same familiar, fully egg-shaped turret as the T-54 Model 1949 variant. However, it features a new TSh-2-22 telescopic gunner's sight instead of the old TSh-20 telescopic gunner's sight. It also has an engine exhaust smoke system that creates a temporary smokescreen by injecting vaporized diesel fuel into the exhaust system. This feature was carried over to the T-54, T-55, and T-62 main battle tank families.
