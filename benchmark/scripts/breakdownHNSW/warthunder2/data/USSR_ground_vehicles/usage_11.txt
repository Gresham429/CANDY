Usage of SU-76M: 
The SU-76M offers an interesting alternative to the ZiS-30. While the ZiS-30 is more mobile and has substantially higher penetration with its powerful 57 mm gun, the SU-76M trades some mobility and penetration for a much more lethal gun and somewhat better survivability for the crew.
