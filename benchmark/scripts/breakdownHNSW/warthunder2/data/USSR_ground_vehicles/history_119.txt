History of T-55AMD-1: 
As one of the top-secret projects of the Soviet Army, the Kompleks 1030M-01 "Drozd" was the very first operational active protection system (APS), developed by Vasily Ivanovich Bakalov of the KPB Design Bureau as a counter to the abundance of RPGs and ATGMs. This project was first started by the Army but was dropped due to budget constraints; the Marines later completed the project as a cheaper alternative to ERA or new T-72 tanks to replace their T-55As. Around 250 of their T-55As were then converted to the AD standard by 1983. The version of T-55AMD-1 in-game was based on the enhanced T-55AM-1 with better engine (V-46-5M at 691hp), and new radio and fire control systems.
