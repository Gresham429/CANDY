History of SU-122P: 
There had been delays in the production of the SU-100 in autumn 1944, and so a new design was offered in the meantime. Uralmash's Design Bureau offered a tank destroyer on the same SU-100 hull, but with a 122 mm D-25S anti-tank gun. The 122 mm gun could be fitted without modification due to the commonality of the gun mounts.
