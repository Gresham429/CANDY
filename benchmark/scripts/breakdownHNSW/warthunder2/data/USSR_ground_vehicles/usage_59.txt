Usage of IS-1: 
As the tank's design purpose suggests, the IS-1 is a heavy tank built with an emphasis on engaging hostile armoured vehicles as well as a breakthrough tank. It has a relatively similar playstyle compared to the previous KV-85 tank, reducing the learning curve. The fast reloads speed of the 85 mm gun (on par with its T-34 and KV-85 mounted sisters) also allows it to be an effective brawler in close quarters combat against multiple targets. When encountering better-protected targets, the IS tank (although equipped with the same type of cannon) has access to APCR rounds to better deal with heavier opponents, something the KV and T-34 models lack.
