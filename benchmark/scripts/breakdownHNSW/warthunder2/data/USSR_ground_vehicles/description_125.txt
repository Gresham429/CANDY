Description of T-64A_(1971): 
The T-64A is the second variant of the T-64 main battle tank family. Even as the first variant of the T-64 was being produced, the design team was hard at work on a new variant, codenamed Object 434 (designated T-64A), to improve the firepower. The new variant was to be outfitted with a brand new and extremely powerful 125 mm D-81T tank gun from the Perm weapons factory. Given the increased calibre of the main armament, it is estimated that only a maximum of 25 rounds can be carried. This was unacceptable to the Soviet designers, but strict dimensional constraints prevented them from enlarging the design to increase interior space. The solution was to replace the human loader with a mechanical autoloader, reducing the crew to three and introducing autoloaders to Soviet main battle tanks for the first time.
