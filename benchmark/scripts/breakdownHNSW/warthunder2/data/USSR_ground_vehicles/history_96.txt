History of T-V_(USSR): 
In World War II on the Eastern Front, the Soviets captured a lot of equipment from the German army that was either left behind or repaired after being damaged in combat. The Soviets then utilized this captured equipment against their former users in the war. This practice is not exclusive to the Soviets, as the German military also used a variety of captured equipment such as Shermans and multiple Soviet tanks.
