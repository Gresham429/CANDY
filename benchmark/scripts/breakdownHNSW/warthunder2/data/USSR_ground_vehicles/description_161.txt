Description of Pantsir-S1: 
The 96K6 Pantsir-S1 is a Russian SPAA designed with the intent of complementing and enhancing the existing air defence capabilities for military, industrial, and administrative installations. The development of the Pantsir-S1 can be traced back to the early 1990s, when the Russian military realised it needed an adaptable short-to-medium-range air defence system. The Instrument Design Bureau (KPB Tula) and the Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant worked together to develop the Pantsir-S1. The main objective was to develop a highly adaptable and powerful anti-aircraft system that could take on a variety of aerial threats, such as helicopters, fighter jets, and drones. It features advanced radar systems and a combination of missiles and guns for effective air defence. Additionally, the system is equipped with a high degree of automation, allowing for quick reaction times and efficient target engagement.
