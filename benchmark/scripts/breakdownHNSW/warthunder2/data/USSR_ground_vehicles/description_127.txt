Description of BMP-2: 
The BMP-2 is a Soviet IFV designed with the intent of overcoming the shortcomings of its predecessor, the BMP-1. The BMP-2 was developed in the late 1970s and quickly became one of the most widely used infantry fighting vehicles in the world. It featured improved firepower, enhanced protection, and an improved fire control system compared to the BMP-1. As one of the most versatile IFVs of its time, the BMP-2 was equipped with a 30 mm automatic cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, making it highly effective against both armoured and infantry targets. Its amphibious capabilities further increased its tactical advantage on the battlefield. Several nations adopted the BMP-2 as a result of its success, and subsequent variants like the BMP-2M allowed for a multi-decade service life extension.
