History of T-90M: 
The T-90M MBT was developed by the Ural Design Bureau of Transport Engineering under the "Breakthrough" modernization program. During this development the T-90 family of tanks received a new welded turret, featuring Relict ERA, an improved engine and a modern fire control system, which includes a panoramic commander sight and multi-channel for the gunner's sight. This modernized variant was presented to the general public in 2017, and since 2019 T-90M tanks have begun to enter service with the Russian Federation's army.
