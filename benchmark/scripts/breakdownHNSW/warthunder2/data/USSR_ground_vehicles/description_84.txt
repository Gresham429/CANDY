Description of ISU-122S: 
The ISU-122S was an improved design (rather than a separate variant) of the ISU-122 assault gun used by the Soviets during World War II, mostly in the anti-tank role. A semi-automatic breech block was fitted to the original 122 mm A-19S tank gun. The tank gun with this new design was designated as the 122 mm D-25S. The modification resulted in an increase in the fire rate to 3 rounds per minute from 1.5 rounds per minute. The ball-shaped gun mantlet and double-baffle muzzle brake of the ISU-122S are distinguishing features. The Germans coded the ISU-122S as Type 249 in their official reports.
