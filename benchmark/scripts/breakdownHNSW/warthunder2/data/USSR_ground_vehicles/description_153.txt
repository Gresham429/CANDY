Description of Object_292: 
The Object 292 was the among one of the most ambitious attempts during the final days of the Soviet Union to create a next-generation tank cannon testbed. The Kirov Plant and Mobile Vehicle Engineering Institute planned to introduce a high-calibre smoothbore cannon to enable Soviet MBTs to be able to disable equivalent NATO MBTs at the longest possible distance. This meant choosing a calibre of 152 mm instead of the conventional 125 mm or slightly larger 130 mm, which were still common calibres in Warsaw-Pact countries, and mounting it onto a hybrid between the T-80BV and T-80U's turret. Due to a severe lack of funding as the Soviet Union was struggling with financial debt, although the cannon proved effective during field tests, the prototype was eventually shelved. However, experiences learned during the program would be further iterated on for future MBT prototypes.
