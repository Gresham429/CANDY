History of KV-220: 
The KV-220 was a further development of the Kliment Voroshilov heavy tank series. It was one of the prototypes intended to become the "KV-3". The design of the KV-220 started in the summer of 1940. Initially the improved tank was envisioned as being very similar to the in production KV-1, with the major difference being in armour and armament. The improved vehicle was to feature 90-100 mm of armour, and to be armed with a 76 mm gun with the ballistics of the 3-K anti-air cannon (F-27), however due to concerns with the power of such a gun, an 85 mm with the ballistics of the 52-K anti-air cannon (F-30) was later also included in these plans. It was realized that in order to fit the 85 mm gun, a larger turret was required, which in turn required an elongated hull. Several prototypes were ordered with differing specifications.
