History of Object_775: 
In the early 1960s, the USSR began to develop a promising medium tank with guided missile weapons. Engineers from the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant presented two prototypes for testing of the Object 775 tank, featuring Rubin anti-tank guided missiles, which are launched from the barrel of the tank. In 1968, the project was closed due to the concentration of efforts on the Object 434 tank project (which became the T-64A). The only surviving Object 775 is on display at the Patriot Park in Kubinka near Moscow.
