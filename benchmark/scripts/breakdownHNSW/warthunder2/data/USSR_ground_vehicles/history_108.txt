History of Object_906: 
The success of the PT-76 amphibious tank prompted the development of a successor with improved characteristics on the battlefield. The project was in development since 1960 by VgTZ under the leadership of I. V. Gavalov. The main purpose of this project was to create a floating tank with a more powerful main cannon than the PT-76B. The vehicle was given the project name Object 906 with the lead designer being Yu. V. Sharin. In total, six prototypes were manufactured at VgTZ, two of which were tested at the NIIBT test site from January to August 1963. The tank was to receive the name PT-85 if it had been adopted for service, however it failed to do so.
