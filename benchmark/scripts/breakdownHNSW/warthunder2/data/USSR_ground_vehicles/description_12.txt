Description of GAZ-AAA_(4M): 
The GAZ-AAA (4M) is the first variant of the GAZ-AAA-based self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. It is a Soviet anti-aircraft truck developed in 1938, based on the GAZ-AAA truck platform and armed with a quad 7.62 mm Maxim light machine gun. The 7.62 mm Maxim light machine guns originate from a World War I Russian Imperial stockpile, of which thousands were available after the war ended. With the unexpected German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviets lacked dedicated anti-aircraft guns. As a result, during the early stages of World War II, many improvised and makeshift anti-aircraft guns are designed. Given its high fire rate, the quad 7.62 mm Maxim light machine gun was extremely effective against low-flying targets. Unfortunately, due to a lack of historical articles and resources, little is known about this improvised anti-aircraft gun. The GAZ-AAA (4M) was delivered in the late summer and winter of 1941, before being replaced by a more powerful variant, the GAZ-AAA (DShK). A total of 37,373 units were produced.
