Description of ASU-85: 
The ASU-85 (Авиадесантная самоходная установка, АСУ-85) was a Cold War-era Soviet-designed airborne self-propelled gun. It began to replace the open-topped ASU-57 in service in 1959. Beginning in 1969, it was superseded by the BMD-1. It was designed to replace older designs such as the ASU-57 for use by the Vozdushno-Desantnye Voyska (VDV). Its design was lengthy and intricate, and it took nearly ten years to complete due to the demanding demands of getting the vehicle airborne. The ASU-85 saw duty as late as the Soviet-Afghan War, but it was far from widespread. The ASU-85 was based on the PT-76 light amphibious tank family chassis, however, it lacked amphibious characteristics and was powered by a different engine. The vehicle was divided into three compartments: the driver's compartment at the front, the combat compartment in the centre, and the engine compartment in the back. The ASU-85 was utilized in airborne missions by the Soviet Airborne Forces. With minimal anti-tank capability, its primary function was light infantry support or assault fortifications. The ASU-85 was only exported to two other Warsaw Pact countries: East Germany and Poland. NATO first noticed it in 1962, and it was frequently utilized by Soviet and Polish airborne units.
