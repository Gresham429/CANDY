Usage of T-10A: 
Even though you have thick armour, HEATFS and APDS will go right through it so be careful. The T-10A's gun is powerful but for targets such as the M-103, you will have a hard time killing due to its effective armour. Your reload time is also very long, you can expect around an 18-second reload which is way less than a IS-3 or IS-4 but still long. When taking a enemy position or cap, try bringing at least 2 allies to help and support you. Since it is a Soviet tank you have a low gun depression of -3Â°, so avoid positions that need gun depression like hills or rough terrain. One special feature that sets the T-10A from other heavy Soviet tanks is a stabilizer which makes a huge difference in combat, however this works only at lower speeds. You also have a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun to take out lightly- armoured targets, planes, or helicopters.
