History of 2S1: 
The development of a new self-propelled gun for the Soviet army was based on the well-proven D-30 howitzer and the chassis of the MT-LB multipurpose amphibious towing vehicle. The D-30 towed howitzer was modified to be placed in the SPG turret, the MT-LB chassis was lengthened by adding a wheel pair to improve the driving performance and increase the room of the fighting compartment. After a year of testing, the vehicle was put into service in September 1970 under the designation 2S1 Gvozdika. Serial production of the SPG continued until 1991. The vehicle was produced in the USSR, as well as in Bulgaria and Poland under license. The 2S1 is still in service with the armies of many countries of the world.
