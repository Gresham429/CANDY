Usage of T-35: 
The T-35 is the largest tank among the Rank I vehicles. With a multi-turreted platform of two 45 mm cannons and one 76.2 mm cannon, the tank can combat enemies at an almost 360Â° angle. However, the armour is quite thin for a vehicle of its size so one should not play this vehicle like a typical heavy tank later down the rank. The speed is decent for a vehicle of its size, however, so it is possible to catch the enemies off guard by attacking from an area they least expect. The T-35 is nothing short of a behemoth, being able to take more penetrating hits than any tank at this BR with his large crew. Although possessing a relatively heavy armament, the lack of armour for its size and speed really limits its playstyle.
