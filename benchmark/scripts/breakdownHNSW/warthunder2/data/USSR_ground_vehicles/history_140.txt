History of T-72B: 
The T-72 was one of the most famous and widely produced Soviet main battle tanks of the Cold War era. Originating as a modification of the T-64, the T-72 retained its predecessor's composite armour, 125 mm smoothbore cannon, and compact dimensions, all modern features for the time. But it was intended to be easier to produce and maintain than the complex and unreliable T-64. Instead of the T-64's opposed piston engine, which promised high power in a compact package but turned out to be a mechanical nightmare, the T-72 used a more traditional V-46 engine with larger dimensions. The engine compartment and suspension were redesigned to suit the new engine. The original T-64 "MZ" autoloader was replaced with the "AZ" autoloader, which stored ammunition in two horizontal trays. The T-72 began to equip standard tank divisions and motorized units while elite units retained the T-64. The combat capabilities of the initial T-72 were very close despite its origin as a somewhat simplified T-64, as the heavier weight was compensated for by the greater engine power. The T-64 tended to have more advanced optics and fire control systems over its service life, and the later T-80 had much superior mobility, but the simple cost effectiveness and reliability of the T-72 made it an excellent tank for widespread deployment and export. It remains in service worldwide in many different variants and has arguably been a more successful design than its ostensibly higher-tech relatives.
