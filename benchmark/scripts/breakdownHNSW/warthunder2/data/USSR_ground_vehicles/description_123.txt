Description of T-10M: 
The T-10M is a modernised modification of the seventh variant of the IS heavy tank family. The T-10 (also known as Object 730 or IS-8) was the final variant of the IS heavy tank produced by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Object 730 was the name given to it during development. It was approved for production as the IS-8 (Iosif Stalin), but due to the political situation following Stalin's death in 1953, it was renamed T-10. The main differences between it and its immediate ancestor, the IS-3, were a longer hull, seven pairs of road wheels rather than six, a larger turret housing a new gun with a fume extractor, an improved diesel engine, and enhanced armour. Overall performance was comparable; however, the T-10 could carry slightly more ammunition, increasing from 28 to 30 rounds. The T-10M is the variant's final modification, seeking to bring it up to the increasingly difficult conditions of the Cold War. It had a longer 122 mm M-62-T2S L/46 tank gun with a five-baffle muzzle brake, a two-plane fully automatic stabilization system, a 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun (which was a better ballistic match for the new main gun), infrared night vision equipment, and NBC protection. It was the last Soviet IS heavy tank to enter service. When the more advanced T-64 main battle tank (MBT) was introduced, it quickly replaced the T-10M in front-line formations.
