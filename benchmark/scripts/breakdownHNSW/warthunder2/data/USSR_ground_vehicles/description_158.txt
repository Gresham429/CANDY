Description of T-80UK: 
The T-80UK was the evaluation prototype of a commander tank version of the T-80U tested in the 1980s. The design of T-80UK was mostly similar to the T-80U, but upgraded with TVD, Shtora-1 soft-kill APS, new FCS, and communication equipment. The vehicle was evaluated and passed state certification in the 1990s, but the certified T-80UK in Russian Army service did not install Shtora-1 APS, likely a result of funding problems during production and saving equipment for more advanced tanks like the T-90. The only prototype is mostly used during army exhibitions or army open days.
