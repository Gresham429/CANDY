Usage of T-34-57: 
The T-34-57 can be played in a variety of roles. The gun is very accurate and has high penetration, making it a great sniper. The tank is fast and manoeuvrable, making it a good flanker. It can also brawl due to its fast turret rotation and great reload speed. However, don't expect to take many hits. At this rank, the T-34's armour will not stand up to enemy guns, even when angled. The best thing to do is keep to the flanks or just behind the battle line and take out enemy tanks at the range and from cover.
