Usage of Object_268: 
The Object 268 is far from being a frontline tank, especially when in uptier, meaning it has to stay away from the enemy's line of sight (LoS) due to the long reload time and relatively exposed weak spots. This does not mean it should be taken all the way through the outskirts of a map to get into position (can be done but not recommended on all maps). It should be used as a sniper in long range maps and a support vehicle in the rest.
