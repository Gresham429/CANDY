Usage of SU-100P: 
The SU-100P is never to be played as a frontline vehicle as the open hull structure is the main weakness which will make enemy team get a free kill by just using their machine guns, this is why the SU-100P should perform the support role. Support role has a wide variety of tactics and course of action, going from a simple cap defender to the enemy's worst flanking nightmare. The tank is one of the most agile, versatile and fast tanks at the battle rating with a really powerful cannon, able to knock out practically any vehicle it faces, most of them even frontally.
