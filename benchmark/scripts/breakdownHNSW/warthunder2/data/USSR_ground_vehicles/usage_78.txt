Usage of T-44: 
The T-44 is a tank that has great mobility and agility, with a somewhat bouncy but not impenetrable armour. The 85 mm cannon may  struggle at its BR. All of these traits produce a recipe for a good flanker. In tight city maps such as Cologne or Stalingrad, the T-44 is great at out-circling lumbering heavies and placing shots in their flanks, as well as in capping target zones in Domination and Break modes. On large open maps such as Mozdok or Kursk, the T-44 can be used to outflank the enemy and either cap the enemy's base (when playing Battle mode), or rush into the enemy rear and surprise any enemy tanks by shooting them from behind. Stay mobile as much as possible and engage only when penetration is assured - the T-44 is simply not sturdy enough to survive head-on shootouts with enemy heavy tanks and tank destroyers. Used properly, the T-44 will serve well as a highly mobile effective medium tank. Experiences earned with this tank is also easily transferable, as the next few Soviet tanks, the T-44-100 and T-54 (1947), are played nearly the same way, except with a much stronger gun on the former, and better armour on the latter.
