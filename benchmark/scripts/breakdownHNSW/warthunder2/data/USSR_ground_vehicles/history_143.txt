History of T-72B3: 
The T-72B3 is the latest modification to the T-72B family. It was a 2011 modification of reserved T-72s which made a complete overhaul to set them on par with the T-90A, T-90S and T-90M MBTs. It featured a change of universal standard double-pin tracks for easier maintenance. It got a heavy increase in firepower which put it at par with the T-90s quickly. It got the Kalina fire control system, kept the past 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 Neman ATGM guidance sight and received the PNM Sosna-U GPS. The autoloader, as the T-90's, was modified to fit longer, more modern ammunition, 3VBM19, 3VBM20, 3VBM22 and 3VBM23. With the UBKh package installed, the vehicle is brought up to the T-72B3M obr. 2016g. standard.
