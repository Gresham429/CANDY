Usage of YaG-10_(29-K): 
This truck is preferably used at a distance to increase its survivability. Most MGs have poor accuracy at distance, greatly decreasing their ability to shred the 29-K. It has a good and very precise gun capable of taking down (almost) any target it may encounter from the front. Always show the sides since it decreases the chances of having a bullet pass right through all of the crew members in one shot. Showing the side also allows the YaG-10 to use the full 360Â° traverse to its best. If possible, only show the gun, this way, it allows minimal exposure and can allow for quick hiding at a moment's notice and if shot, only sacrifices one or two crew members.
