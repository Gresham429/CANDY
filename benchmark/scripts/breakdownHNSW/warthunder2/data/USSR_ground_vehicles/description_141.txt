Description of T-72B_(1989): 
The T-72B Model 1989 is an armoured modification of the T-72B, which is the third variant of the T-72 main battle tank family. It is distinguished primarily by its use of advanced Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA) and additional composite armour on the sides of the turret. The Kontakt-5 is a second-generation ERA that was designed and built in the Soviet Union. It is also the first type of ERA in the world to significantly reduce the penetration of armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) ammunition, which conventional ERA cannot do.
