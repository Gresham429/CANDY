Description of T-60: 
The T-60 was a Soviet light tank, developed in late 1930s as a replacement for the amphibious T-38 scout tank. The team around designer Nicholas Astrov started designing the tank at Moscow Factory No. 37 in 1938 and two prototypes designated T-38A and T-38B were produced. The former was manufactured from 1940 as the T-40 light amphibious tank. The T-60 was considered a stop-gap tank after the German attack on Soviet Union, until the factories could produce enough T-34s and KV tanks. The T-60 used the chassis from the T-40 but gave up the ability to float for thicker armour protection. The T-60 was initially to be armed with a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun, but the army demanded stronger armament so a 20 mm TNSh cannon was chosen instead. The TNSh was a tank version of the aircraft ShVAK cannon and as such had very low penetration characteristics, being able to penetrate only 15 mm of armour at 500 m. Such gun characteristics were not enough to engage newer German up-armoured tanks, so the T-60 was moved into the role of an infantry support tank. The T-60 served as a base for an upgunned and uparmoured version which would later become the T-70 tank. The T-60 served through the entire war and Romania modified 34 captured T-60s into their domestic TACAM T-60 tank destroyer.
