Usage of SU-57B: 
The SU-57B is a light armoured tank destroyer, armed with a deadly 57 mm ZiS-4  anti-tank gun that is not a threat to take lightly for most enemy vehicles at its BR, though being a lightly armoured vehicle it can prove to be a very difficult vehicle to master at first. But even with its light armour it got a useful acceleration and top speed makes it a opponent to be wary against. A well placed or hidden Su-57B can with ease prove to be a great obstacle for the enemy armoured units.
