Usage of Object_292: 
When players see the Object 292 from afar, some might take it as a very odd modification of T-64A due to the turret design, while some might take it as a T-80U with all Kontakt-5 ERA packages destroyed; once their vehicle is hit by APFSDS flying at an unprecedented 1,980 m/s or bombarded by a huge "howitzer" shell, they will soon know what really hit them.
