History of BTR-152A: 
The BTR (Russian: Бронетранспортер/Bronetransporter or "armoured transport") was a modified design according to the ZiS-151 truck. It features a 6x6 chassis with an additional 5 tons of sloped armour. The mobility and speed were inferior to the original ZiS-151 truck, but it relied on more protection, which was vital than speed. By 1960, the model had been significantly improved in terms of characteristics.
