Usage of BMP-1: 
The BMP-1's limitations as a light tank hinders its ability to directly fight enemy vehicles, it will not survive any punishment sent its way. It needs to play with cover and concealment frequently, as any vehicle with a heavy machine gun, be it ground or air, can quite easily shred the BMP-1 apart if a round hits the left side or roof armour. Considering one of the common enemy nation of the BMP-1 in RB is the USA, which has a habit of putting a heavy machine gun on any tank, means that the BMP-1 needs to be extremely careful and aware of their surroundings before moving up, lest it gets torn apart by a barrage of bullets. In AB, the biggest threat to it is its own brethren, as fighting other BMPs is very difficult and relies on difference in your skills a lot (or, at least, on ability to press "aim assist" and "fire" faster).
