Usage of Object_906: 
As with every other light tank, this vehicle should be handled with caution on the battlefield since any enemy the 906 encounters can penetrate it. Use its awesome mobility and good, stabilized gun to provide a nasty surprise to the enemy from unexpected spots. Whether by river, lake, ocean, the 906 can navigate through all bodies of water within the limit of the battlefield. This tank is best used as a flanker, shooting on the move, reloading in the dark, popping up behind another hill to take another moving shot, this is a ninja tank.
