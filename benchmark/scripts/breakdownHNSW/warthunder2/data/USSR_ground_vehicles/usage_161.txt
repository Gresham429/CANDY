Usage of Pantsir-S1: 
The Pantsir-S1 is the final word when it comes to Russian self-propelled anti-air technology, and as such affords the player much more flexibility when it comes to anti-air operations than ever before. The radar can be toggled to scan the skies in varying degrees of elevation and speed; players can choose the 30 degree mode for lower flying targets on the horizon with faster update speeds or the 80 degree mode allowing for unparalleled ability to target high flying targets at a cost of update speed, or a compromise between both with the 60 degree mode. Either way, with skilful toggling, there is little of the sky that the Pantsir-S1 cannot touch thanks to its new 95Ya6 missiles that can fly out to 20 km at nearly 50% faster top speed than the 9M311 missiles on the Tunguska. Complementary to the enhanced radar and missile suite is a very powerful gunner optic that can zoom to 28x, allowing for better target recognition and acquisition on the battlefield.
