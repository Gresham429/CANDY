Usage of SMK: 
Confidently stand against most enemy tanks especially if they are without support, use caution against engaging multiple targets from a distance however as a track hit will end any day on the battlefield, the SMK packs its biggest punch up close and cannot expect to survive against sniping units if caught in the open. Keep the tank moving as much as possible and slightly angled facing enemies directly. When engaging heavies it's best to not go toe to toe; however by disabling a track or turret the SMK can hold up in close proximity to most heavy enemy tanks. HE and shrapnel shells are not this tanks forte, rather its APHE rounds usually due to the trick against most enemy units. The SMK can also fool enemies by shooting the 45 mm cannon, then letting the opponent peek out when they think that the cannon is reloading, and shoot them with the 76 mm cannon instead.
