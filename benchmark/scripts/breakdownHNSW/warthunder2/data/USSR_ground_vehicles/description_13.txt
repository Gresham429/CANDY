Description of GAZ-AAA_(DShK): 
The GAZ-AAA (DShK) is the second variant of the GAZ-AAA-based self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. In contrast to the first variant, the GAZ-AAA (4M), the main armament is a 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine gun. This slightly increases its firepower against aircraft and lightly armoured vehicles.
