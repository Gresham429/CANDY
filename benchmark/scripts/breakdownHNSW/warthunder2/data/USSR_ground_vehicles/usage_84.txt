Usage of ISU-122S: 
The ISU-122S performs well as a long range sniper, taking advantage of the APHEBC shell's high penetration values, high gun accuracy and good reverse speed. Find a shooting spot and engage targets from at least 1,000 m away to prevent enemy progress towards the objectives. Because of its high profile (casemate), long reload, and weak frontal armour, always stay away from the frontline to avoid being flanked or swarmed. While your gun is very powerful, your in-game performance will highly be dependent on the map you are playing on. Open maps like Fire Arc, Kursk, or Maginot Line will allow you to make the best use of its sniping capabilities, whereas urban environments like Advance to the Rhine are generally poor maps for the ISU-122S. In case you are playing on a mixed terrain map, prefer open spaces.
