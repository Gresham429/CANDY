Usage of T-26-4: 
All three of this tank's shells have a very low muzzle velocity, which means that engaging targets at long range, or even at medium range, is difficult. Users of the T-26-4 may find that the vehicle does the most damage up close, where aiming is easier. Fortunately, most engagements at this tier are close-quarters.
