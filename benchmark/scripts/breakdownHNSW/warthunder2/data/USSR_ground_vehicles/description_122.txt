Description of T-72A: 
The T-72A is the second variant of the T-72 main battle tank family. It is a member of one of the most extensive and vast main battle families, with nearly 25,000 units of all variants built. The second variant, T-72A, has several improvements over the first variant, which is also known as "Ural." The TPD-2-49 coincidence optical rangefinder has been replaced with the TPD-K1 laser rangefinder, and a modern electronic fire control has been added. The turret front is heavily armoured with composite armour, and there are provisions for mounting explosive reactive armour (ERA) and smoke grenade launchers. In the 1980s, a large number of the first variants, the T-72 "Ural", were also modernized and upgraded to this standard.
