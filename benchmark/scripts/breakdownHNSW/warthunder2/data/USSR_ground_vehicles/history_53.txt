History of MK-IX_%22Valentine%22_(USSR): 
As part of the Lend-Lease program, the Soviet Union requested tanks and other military supplies from American and Great Britain to replenish their losses during their defense against Nazi Germany. Evaluating the available tank models that can be sent to the Soviet Union, the Soviet liaison mission in Britain decided on two tanks, the Matilda and the Valentine tank.[1] The shipments of Valentine tanks would be fulfilled by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, which began on September 28, 1941.[2]
