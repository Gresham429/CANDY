Usage of T-34E_STZ: 
There are two main ways to utilize this tank. The first is by staying at long range, and using the frontal armour and good gun to pick off enemies. When at long range remember that the front turret is the greatest weakness of this tank so try to not look directly at the enemy during reloading. The second is as a close-range brawler when using the tank in this manner make sure to watch the flanks. Both of these methods are equally viable, at close range seems to be where this tank does a little better.
