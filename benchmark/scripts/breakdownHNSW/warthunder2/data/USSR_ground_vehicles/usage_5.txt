Usage of T-28_(1938): 
For the size of the T-28 (1938), it has quite the mobility and its gun is quite powerful for its BR, though it lacks in penetration against the more armoured vehicles. The T-28 (1938) is best used in a close combat setting, though it will struggle significantly against even reserve tanks like the American M2A4 due to the very low penetration of its gun. Unlike the succeeding versions, the T-28 (1938) can't shoot enemy tanks at a middle to long range, so avoid sniping and try to get as close as possible to the enemies. Don't travel in the open, the armour won't last long to enemy fire.
