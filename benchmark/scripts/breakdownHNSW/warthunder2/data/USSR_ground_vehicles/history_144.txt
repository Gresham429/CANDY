History of T-80B: 
The T-80B is an improved variant of the T-80 main battle tank that debuted in 1978. It received a laser rangefinder, a new fire-control system, and a new autoloader; these modifications allowed the firing of 9M112-1 Kobra anti-tank guided missiles. The ATGMs could be launched at any speed, and they were fired out of the gun barrel. The T-80B also featured new composite armour. In 1980, the T-80B received a new 1,100 hp engine. In 1982 a new gun was fitted, and fittings for ERA were added in 1985. The ERA increased protection against chemical warheads significantly, at an estimated 400 mm of additional chemical protection.
