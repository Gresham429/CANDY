Usage of Khrizantema-S: 
Like the Shturm-S, the Khrizantema-S is an extremely flawed tank and is already outclassed by almost everything at its own BR, most noticeably when fighting proximity missile carriers. It also lost its anti-air ability, relying on the sheer speed of the missiles and, sometimes, its radar to hit aircraft. The radar is also quite a liability in AB due to it being a target for explosives in a mode where all cannon-mounted tanks have aim prediction and assistance, and, unlike with the Shturm-S, this carrier will explode if hit by a chemical shell anywhere.
