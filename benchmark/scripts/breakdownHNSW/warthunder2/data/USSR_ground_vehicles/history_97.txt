History of IS-2_%22Revenge%22: 
The IS-2 was an evolved IS-1 heavy tank after the 85 mm gun initially mounted on the IS-1 no longer became a firepower advantage after the standard T-34 medium tank was upgraded with the same gun into the T-34-85. Due to that, the IS-1 was discontinued in January 1944 and awaited further upgrade in order to put it back into its place as the heavy tank of the Soviet Red Army.
