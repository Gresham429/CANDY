History of Object_279: 
The Object 279 heavy tank was a combat vehicle intended to break through prepared defenses of the enemy in difficult terrain such as swamps, deep snow and vertical obstacles like boulders, hedgehogs, etc. Such cross-country capability was achieved through four tracks. It was developed between 1954 and 1960 jointly by OKBT LKZ and VNII-100 in Leningrad under the leadership of L. S. Troyanov. The presentation of the prototype for factory tests, as well as the hull and turret for firing tests, was planned for the last quarter of 1957 and the production of two machines by the second quarter of 1958.[1]
