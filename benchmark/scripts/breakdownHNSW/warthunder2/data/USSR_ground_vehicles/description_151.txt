Description of 2S38: 
Originally designed as a technology demonstrator, the 2S38 was chosen as a possible replacement for the 2S6 Tunguska adopted in the 1980s. The vehicle was based on the BMP-3 platform, but fitted with the equipment and armament to lock and engage low-flying aircraft like helicopters, CAS, or even large calibre rockets/missiles. The vehicle is operated by 3 crewmembers, in a single compartment, since it uses a remote-controlled turret for its 57 mm cannon. As of 2020, the vehicle is still in very low numbers and slowly being adopted into the military.
