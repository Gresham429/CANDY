History of PT-76-57: 
In the early 2000s, the issue of increasing the combat effectiveness of the numerous, but outdated PT-76's was proposed to be solved in a very non-trivial way. Engineers of the Nizhny Novgorod design bureau "Burevestnik" combined the 57 mm automatic gun developed in the USSR at the end of the 70s with a mechanized ammunition rack, combining this in a combat module for a specially created turret for light tanks of the PT-76 series. While considering possible ways to re-equip old amphibious tanks with a new weapon, the small-calibre automatic cannon, although it was inferior to other variants of larger calibres in terms of armour penetration, gained a lot in terms of the burst weight to time ratio, as well as in possible applications - from destroying armoured vehicles (including a modern MBT when hit to the side) to fighting helicopters.
