Usage of Object_279: 
The Object 279 is in a position where its main gun can penetrate most things it faces, and the large HE filler guarantees a knock-out. However, the hull is weak, unless you are in a full downtier, it should definitely not be relied on. The turret, on the other hand, is incredibly strong. The Object 279 plays quite well like a tank destroyer, using your 1,000 m/s APHE shell and strong turret armour to quickly peek and take pot-shots at enemy positions. This strategy is effective in uptiers. In a full downtier you can use it like a heavy tank, rushing caps and storming enemy positions, but HEATFS is abundant even at 7.7 and will end you fast.
