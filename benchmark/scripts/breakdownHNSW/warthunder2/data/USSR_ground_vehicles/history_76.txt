History of KV-2_(ZiS-6): 
In the late 1930s, the Soviet Directorate of Artillery, a part of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, issued a directive to design and build larger field artillery. By late 1937, going into 1938, proposals included both 95 mm calibre and 107 mm calibre. In the early 1940s, the Soviets had incorrectly received reports of up-armoured German tanks, leading them to question if their current 45 mm and 76 mm cannons were sufficient to combat the new German tanks. In response, the Soviets eventually drew up plans for the KV-4, to be armed with a ZiS-6 107 mm cannon. The 107 mm cannon passed factory tests in early 1941, and by mid 1941, had been mounted into the turret of a KV-2 for further testing and analysis. It was through this testing that the KV-2 with ZiS-6 cannon came into existence, as we see it in War Thunder.
