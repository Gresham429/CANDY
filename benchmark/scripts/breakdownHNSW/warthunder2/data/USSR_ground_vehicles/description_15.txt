Description of T-35: 
The T-35 was one of many interwar period multi-turreted tanks built by various countries. Unfortunately, usage of multiple turrets proved worse in combat than using just a single, so such tanks were abandoned. The T-35 was the first and only five-turreted tank in the world. Designed in the 1930s, the T-35 was basically an enlarged T-28 multi-turreted medium tank with a crew of ten instead of six. Unfortunately, the T-35 was plagued with mechanical problems and failures, such as weak engine, cramped crew compartments, and thin armour of up to only 30 mm. Only 59 were produced between 1934 and 1939. Last combat usage was recorded during the Battle of Kharkov in 1941. A single example has survived until today, and is now located in Kubinka tank museum, in running condition.
