Description of T-72B: 
The T-72B is the third variant of the T-72 main battle tank family. This features many improvements compared to its predecessors. A cutting-edge 125 mm 2A46M tank gun with a newly developed two-plane fully automatic stabilization system known as 2E42-2 has been installed. A significantly improved 1A40-1 fire control system, as well as the 1K13-49 gunner's sight for firing the 9M119 Svir anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) through the gun barrel, have also been added. To increase protection, 20 mm of appliqu√© armour was mounted on the front of the hull. The mobility upgrade package included a new V-84-1 engine with 840 horsepower. The smoke dischargers, which were previously mounted on the turret front as on the T-72A variant, were later grouped on the turret's left side to make room for the installation of explosive reactive armour (ERA).
