History of T-55A: 
The T-55A is a variant of the extremely-popular T-55 main battle tank produced by the USSR after the Second World War. Along with the earlier T-54 main battle tanks, the T-54/T-55 MBT family is the most-produced tank series in history. The T-55 MBT design featured numerous improvements over the prior T-54s, including additional NBC (Nuclear, Biological & Chemical) protection systems, a new heavier turret, more ammunition, and improved equipment. The T-55A was a late modification of the earlier T-55 MBT, including improved NBC systems.
