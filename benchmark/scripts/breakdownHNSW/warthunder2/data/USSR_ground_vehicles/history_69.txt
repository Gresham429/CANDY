History of BM-31-12: 
Unguided 300 mm M-30 rockets were used by the Red Army since 1942 as a field artillery, being fired from metal frames right in the transporting containers. Soon, an upgraded version of the rocket appeared under the designation M-31 with an improved engine and a significantly increased range. Engineers from the special design bureau of the Moscow Kompressor plant designed a combat vehicle on the chassis of the US-built Studebaker US6 three-axle truck with a framework of 12 welded rails to launch these powerful rockets. The machine was successfully tested in the spring of 1944 and was put into service in June under the designation BM-31-12. In the troops, by analogy with the Katyusha MLRS, the new vehicle was nicknamed Andryusha (“little Andrey” in Russian).
