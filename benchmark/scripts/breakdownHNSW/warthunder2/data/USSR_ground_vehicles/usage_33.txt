Usage of ZiS-30: 
As mentioned above, the ZiS-30 is ideal for ambush and sniping attacks, especially due to the fairly flat trajectory of the rounds. Bring a full load of ammo (it carries only 20 rounds), especially the standard-issue APHE shell, which is capable of penetrating the armour of just about every reasonable enemy for your battle rating. Shoot'n'scoot tactics are advised and use the surprising agility of the vehicle to get into unexpected locations. When setting up an ambush in RB, you can turn off your engine to be even less detectable once you've found a spot where to wait for the enemy. Once the enemy drives into your crosshair, your short reload time will guarantee that you can fire a follow-up shot in case you missed the first shot or did not knock out the enemy in one hit and left you exposed to machine gun fire.
