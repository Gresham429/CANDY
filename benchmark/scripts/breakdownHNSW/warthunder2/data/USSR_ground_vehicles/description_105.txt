Description of IS-4M: 
The IS-4M is an improved modification of the fourth variant of the IS heavy tank family. Like the IS-3, the IS-4 (designation Object 701) was intended to replace the IS-2. The IS-4 was designed to be the pride of the Soviet Army, with extremely thick armour, a weight of 53 tonnes, and a 750 horsepower V-12 diesel engine capable of reaching speeds of up to 43 km/h. Despite being an upgrade to the IS-2, it never offered much to the table, particularly when compared to the IS-3, a lighter, faster, and cheaper tank that had stunned the Western world only a few years previously. The IS-4, most importantly, used the same 122 mm D-25T tank gun as the IS-2 and IS-3. Production began in March 1947 and stopped in 1949, as any work on tanks weighing more than 50 tonnes was to be terminated. The tank proved to be too heavy, sluggish, and poorly built. IS-4M, a small batch of 25 units with some enhancements, was constructed in 1951. Only 258 units were built in total.
