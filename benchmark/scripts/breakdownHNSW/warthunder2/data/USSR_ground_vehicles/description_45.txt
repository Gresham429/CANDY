Description of T-34_(1st_Gv.T.Br.): 
The T-34 (1941) 1st Guards Tank Army is a special T-34 (1941), which is the second variant of the T-34 medium tank family that served in the 1st Guards Tank Army (1-я гвардейская танковая Краснознамённая армия). The origins of the Russian Ground Forces' 1st Guards Tank Army may be traced back to the 1st Tank Army, which was established twice in July 1942 and January 1943 before being renamed the 1st Guards Tank Army in January 1944. During World War II, the army fought with the Red Army on the Eastern Front. Mikhail Katukov commanded the army throughout most of the battle. It took part in the Battle of Stalingrad and Operation Uranus, as well as the Battle of Kursk, the Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation, the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation, the Vistula-Oder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin. The army was stationed in East Germany after the war as part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.
