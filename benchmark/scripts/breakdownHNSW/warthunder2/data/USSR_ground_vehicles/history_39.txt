History of ZiS-12_(94-KM): 
Soviet mobile anti-aircraft defences in World War II was quite lacking in comparison to other nation's. Their self-propelled anti-aircraft guns are mainly improvised truck beds mounting a light anti-aircraft gun, such as Maxim machine guns on the GAZ-AAA (4M) and a single 25 mm autocannon in the GAZ-MM (72-K). By the end of 1943, the design bureau at Plant no.88 wanted to mount two 25 mm 72-K guns onto a truck bed. The guidance system on the new design was derived from the 37 mm 61-K gun. The gun system was mounted onto the back of a ZIS-12 truck bed, which was derived from the ZIS-5 truck. In 1944, the weapon system was accepted for testing and later approved as the 94-KM ZIS-12. Plant no.88 produced the 94-KM from 1944 to 1945 before stopping at either production number 225 or 237, possibly due to the introduction of the better ZSU-37 anti-aircraft system.
