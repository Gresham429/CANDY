Usage of T-72M2_Moderna: 
The T-72M2 Moderna excels in mid- to long-range engagements with its powerful and accurate 125mm cannon. The recommended tactic is similar to most other Russian MBTs at this BR: find targets at range using the thermal sights, then use the laser rangefinder and highly capable APFSDS shells to knock out the target from as far away from your vehicle as possible. This is due to some inherent vehicle weaknesses, some of which will appear below, such as the slow turret traverse and poor reverse gear. At range, the T-72M2 suffers far less from these design drawbacks and with its 2nd generation thermal sights for both the gunner and commander, you can scour the battlefield quickly for enemy vehicles. NATO MBTs such as the Leopard 2A4 and M1 Abrams this tier only have a 1st generation thermal sight for the gunner and lack thermals on the commander sight (or lack a commander sight entirely!), and as such have to rely on a much narrower FOV than your commander sight and with a lower resolution. However, do keep in mind that if your commander is knocked out, you will be unable to exploit this advantage.8
