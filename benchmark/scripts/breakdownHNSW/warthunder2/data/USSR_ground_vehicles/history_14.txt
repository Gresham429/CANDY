History of T-26_(1st_Gv.T.Br.): 
A Soviet derivative of the British Vickers 6-ton light tank, the T-26 first saw combat in the Spanish Civil War where it showed its superiority over tanks fielded by Italy and Germany during that period. The T-26 then saw combat against the Japanese in the Soviet-Japanese border conflicts at Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol, which exposed some design defects of the vehicle such as poor armour welding and the disadvantages of riveted construction (the rivet could break off if impacted and could harm the crew inside). After that, the T-26 saw service in the Invasion of Poland and the Winter War against Finland.
