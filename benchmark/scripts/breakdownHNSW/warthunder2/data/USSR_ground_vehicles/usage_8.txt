Usage of T-60: 
The T-60 is a fine little tank that excels in very particular situations; namely holding corners, flanking, and acting as a close range SPAA. This tank should never be used for long-range shooting or in pushes against an enemy head-on, one should always try to use its speed and manoeuvrability to gain an advantage before attacking. In a SPAA role, the long reload time for this tank's main weapon can be a severe disadvantage. This means that one should use controlled bursts when attacking aeroplanes, making all shots count, and only picking large slow moving targets when at the range. The presence of a co-axial machine gun, however, not only adds to the firing density but allows for the tank to fire whilst the cannon is reloading. This machine gun has no utility against armoured targets. In this role, the T-60 is the only SPAA in this rank that does not have to fear 7.7 mm rounds (although 12.7 mm rounds can be very deadly - the M2A2 is a very dangerous opponent, for instance). This means that T-60 pilots can be confident that they can survive being strafed by most fighter aircraft. In RB this tank serves as a perfectly capable replacement for the 4M GAZ-AAA. In conclusion, the T-60 is a versatile tank of good effectiveness that is a constant presence of any Rank I ground forces game. Its gun gives it easy penetration at the sides and some fronts of low-rank tanks.
