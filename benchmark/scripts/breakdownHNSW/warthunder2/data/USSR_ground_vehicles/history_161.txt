History of Pantsir-S1: 
The 96K6 Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missile and artillery system, developed in the mid-1990s, was designed to protect strategically important areas, troops and long-range air defense systems. Due to the economic crisis in Russia, the development of the system was sluggish, but hot boosted in the late 90s, with new tactical requirements appearing for export of the system to the UAE. The modified Pantsir with a long-range radar also began to enter service with the Russian army, primarily in the air defense units. The version on the chassis of the KamAZ 8x8 truck appeared in 2006, and after successfully passing the tests, the Pantsir-S1 modification was put into trial operation, and in 2012 commissioned for service. At the moment, systems of the Pantsir family are in service with the Russian army and are constantly upgraded. The air defense system is intensively exported, the largest foreign operators of the Pantsir systems are Morocco, Syria, Algeria, Iraq and other countries.
