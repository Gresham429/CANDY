History of IS-4M: 
During the development of the IS-3 in 1944 under General Nikolai Dukhov, a separate project was underway by a design team led by L.S. Troyanov to improve the IS-2 design. This separate project commenced under the designation Object 701. The project produced three proposed design. The Object 701-2 with a S-34 100 mm gun, 701-5 with a different armour configuration, and the 701-6 with the 122 mm D-25 gun. The 701-6 was accepted for further development, to which was modified with thicker armour, longer hull, and a more powerful engine. There was some implementation of German designs into the prototype; the engine has a cooling system that uses a pair of circular fans on the engine deck, a feature also is seen on the Panther tank.[1]
