Usage of BT-7M: 
The BT-7M is a great tank to rush to capture points at the very start of a match. Its speed and agility can get you to the point in time, even well before the enemies arrive. When you are close to the point be careful and prepare to perform a hard break to target potential enemy vehicles or have some cover options in mind to get behind them as fast as possible. If you do see enemy light tanks arriving at the same time as you, try destroying them as soon as possible, as leaving them alive can create more problems if they get away successfully. The BT-7M's 45 mm APHEBC should have no issue penetrating and knocking out almost all fast vehicles with a single shot.
