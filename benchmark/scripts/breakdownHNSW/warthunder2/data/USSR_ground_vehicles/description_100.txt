Description of T-44-100: 
The T-44 was developed as the successor of the legendary T-34 tank, and although it was much superior, it retained the same 85 mm cannon. A 122 mm gun was fitted in some prototypes, but this was deemed unsatisfactory. Thus, an upgraded version was developed with the 100 mm D-10T. Testing began in October 1944 for this upgrade at the Ural Tank Factory, and different cannons were tested, like the D-10TK and the LB-1. The new armament meant a modified turret with its ring diameter increased, with increased weight and increased armour in the turret as well as armour panels in the sides. The results of the so called T-44B were excellent and the army saw a lot of potential in the design, and even though the T-44-100 didn't reach serial production, two prototypes were constructed, and the army wanted a design with the same characteristics, but more modern, reliable and versatile. Thus, the T-54 was created, and further development of the T-44 was stopped.
