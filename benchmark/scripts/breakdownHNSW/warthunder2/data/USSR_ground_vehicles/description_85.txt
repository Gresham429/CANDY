Description of SU-100: 
The SU-100 was a Soviet self-propelled anti-tank gun that was developed in 1944 based on the T-34-85 tank chassis. It was armed with a powerful 100 mm D-10S gun that could penetrate the armour of German heavy tanks at long ranges. It was produced at the Ural Heavy Machinery Factory (UZTM) in Yekaterinburg and saw extensive service during the last year of the Second World War and afterwards with the Soviet allies. The SU-100 was designed by a team of engineers led by L. I. Gorlitskiy, who received the Stalin Prize for their work.
