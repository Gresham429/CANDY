Usage of SU-100Y: 
This tank is all about the gun. It defines what being a bonafide tank destroyer is. Bad armour, bad mobility, but amazing firepower. Just park the tank in a position where the SU-100Y will be difficult to flank. That way when the vehicles do fire the gun, it can immediately run and hide while the gun reloads. It can not be emphasized enough, this tank can not let itself get shot at. It just doesn't have the armour. But once ready to let one of the 130 mm shells loose, this tank fears few.
