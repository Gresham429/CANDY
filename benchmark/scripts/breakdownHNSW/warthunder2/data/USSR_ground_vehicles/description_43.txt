Description of SMK: 
The SMK is a premium rank II Soviet heavy tank 
with a battle rating of 3.7 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.45 "Steel Generals". The SMK was named after Sergei Mironovich Kirov, an early Communist Party official who was assassinated in 1934. A twin-turret heavy tank, the SMK provides an interesting playstyle to its users. Only one prototype was built before the project was dropped.
