Usage of T-80UM2: 
In general use, sticking by teammates and playing support can immensely increase your effectiveness in this vehicle, as oftentimes your teammates may see a target, but fail to destroy it. In such a case, you can quickly finish them off, or assist teammates in tricky situations, where an extra gun is needed. This strategy has immense potential in urban areas or other maps with tight or cramped high-traffic areas. With that said, it's also best to remember that your reverse speed is subpar, so if you push, do so cautiously, as you'll seldom find yourself lucky enough to pull out of a bad spot.
