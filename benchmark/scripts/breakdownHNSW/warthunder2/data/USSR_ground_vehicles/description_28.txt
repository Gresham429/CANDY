Description of T-28E: 
The T-28E is an upgraded T-28 with additional armour by adding shields welded on top of the tank's armour, giving it improved protection due to the lessons learned during the Winter War with Finland. The E stands for ekranirovannij which means shielded. Due to adding additional weight due to the extra protection, the T-28 went from 28 tons to 32 tons.
