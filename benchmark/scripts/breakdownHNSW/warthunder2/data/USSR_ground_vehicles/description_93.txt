Description of T-44-122: 
The T-44-122 was a Soviet medium tank which was supposed to replace T-34 in service as the main tank of the Red Army. The T-44-122 is the third prototype after the first two prototypes armed with 85 mm D-5T guns. The 122 mm D-25-44T gun was used, unlike the regular D-25T it was using a single piece ammunition to increase rate of fire aswell as double buffle muzzle break. The tank underwent first trials between February and March 1944 but unsuccessfuly as the gun failed and had to be returned to factory for repairs. Second trials were conducted between April and May 1944 where the T-44-122 competed with a captured German Panther tank and second of the 85 mm armed T-44 prototypes. The T-44-122 had practical rate of fire of two to three rounds per minute and very limited ammo storage of only 24 rounds, which were both deemed insufficient. As a result all further development was suspended and only development of the 85 mm armed variant continued.
