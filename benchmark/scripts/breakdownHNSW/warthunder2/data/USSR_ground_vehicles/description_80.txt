Description of IS-2_(1944): 
The IS-2 model 1944 is the late-generation second variant of the IS heavy tank family. It features a uniformly sloped 100 mm hull upper front glacis plate at a 60Â° angle. Reliability was improved over time as well: the earliest IS-2s were only guaranteed for a 1,000 km distance before breakdowns; by late 1944, however, the commander of the 1st Belorussian Front stated that "the heavy tanks worked well and exceeded the warranty period by 1.5 to 2 times, both in hours usage and kilometres." As a light defence against hostile aircraft, a 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine gun is installed on the turret roof near the commander cupola. Some sources claim that 1,150 units were constructed before May 1945 when the IS-2 was discontinued in favour of the much better IS-3.
