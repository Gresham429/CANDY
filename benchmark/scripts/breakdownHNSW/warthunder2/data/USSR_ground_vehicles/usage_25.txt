Usage of T-34_(1941): 
The T-34 (1941) is one of the most well rounded medium battle tanks at its rank among it with the German Pz.IV F2 and United States M4 Sherman tanks. The sloped armour, great acceleration, good speed, and excellent 76.2 mm cannon make it a force to be reckoned with especially against inexperienced players, though against experienced players this advantage is less substantial. Compared to the 1940 version, the 1941 gets a better 76.2 mm cannon which greatly improves the penetration power, but still keeps the thinly armored 1940 model turret. At distance, the sloped armour is efficient at blocking shells from enemy tanks with relatively short and small-calibre cannons even some long barrel and high calibre guns can also have trouble penetrating on the sloped armour if used well. Even with its sloped armour advantages, a T-34 is a relatively easy tank to knock out with a well-placed shot to the side, turret, or at close range by a larger cannon.
