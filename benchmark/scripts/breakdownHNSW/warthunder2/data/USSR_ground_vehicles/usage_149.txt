Usage of 2S6: 
The ZPRK 2S6 Tunguska can excel in many different ways. Traditionally it can take down aircraft with ease no matter how far or how close they may be with its excellent combined power of the very fast firing quad 30 mm autocannons and the highly agile SAMs it has in its disposal. The SAMs are very fast and extremely agile, with the assistance of tracking and enough experience they can be almost virtually impossible to evade, even by the fastest and most agile aircraft. Each of the eight missiles is mounted on its own launch tube, which means you can launch one after the other without waiting for another one to reload, such as in systems like the Roland 1 and FlaRakRad. They also have a long range of 8 km stock, and 10 km with the 2S6M1 modification installed, which is enough to hit any helicopters hovering at the edge of their Air-to-Ground missile ranges. However, some vehicles can prove very challenging to take down, particularly those equipped with radar warning and missile alert systems, as they can quickly take evasive actions or hide behind terrain to prevent them from being hit.
