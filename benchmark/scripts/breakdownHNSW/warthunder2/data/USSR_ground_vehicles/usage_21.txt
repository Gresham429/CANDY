Usage of BM-8-24: 
The BM-8-24 only offers 24 rockets as its main armament, the ideal playstyle is use the terrain to hide from the enemies and wait for them to pass you by before you strike. The rockets work best when they are fired in volley, it takes one well placed hit to knock out an enemy tank.
