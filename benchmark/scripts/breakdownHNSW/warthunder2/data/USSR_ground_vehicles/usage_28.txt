Usage of T-28E: 
The powerful, yet accurate gun, paired with large profile make the T-28 look ideal for long-range encounters, yet its low penetration, slow shell muzzle velocity and the absence of gun depression to cover yourself behind terrain quite discourage this kind of gameplay style. But the crew/equipment spacing, its high versatility and powerful main gun make this tank quite capable in close range encounters. Hit and run tactics work pretty well (if the "run" aspect of it is ever needed).
