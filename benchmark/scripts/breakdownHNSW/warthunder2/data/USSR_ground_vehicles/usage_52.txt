Usage of MK-II_%22Matilda%22_(USSR): 
The MK-II "Matilda" (USSR) should be played as a support tank like the KV-1 (L-11), taking advantage of its good armour and good penetration power.
When playing as a support tank, you will help friendly tanks successfully defeat enemy tanks in their frontline engagements. Stay in proximity of the frontline to rely on penetration power, all while staying at a reasonable distance from it to maximize your armour and avoid being flanked or swarmed. Once the enemy push destroyed, you move forward together with frontline tanks and help capturing objectives.
