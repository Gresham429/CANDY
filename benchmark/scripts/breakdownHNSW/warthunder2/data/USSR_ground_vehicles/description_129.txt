Description of BMP-3: 
The BMP-3 (Object 688M) was a Soviet IFV designed with the intent of fulfilling a dual role of transporting infantry and providing heavy firepower support on the battlefield. Its development began in the 1970s, when engineers at Kurganmashzavod first came up with the idea, and it continued through the 1980s. It entered service with the Soviet Army in 1987, becoming an integral part of their armoured units. One of the most notable differences between the BMP-3 and its predecessor, the BMP-2, is the weaponry. While the BMP-2 was armed with a 30 mm 2A42 autocannon and the 9M113 Konkurs ATGM, the BMP-3 boasted much more potent armament. Its 100 mm 2A70 semi-automatic cannon, in combination with a 30 mm 2A72 autocannon, gave it an edge in both anti-armour capabilities and fire support. Throughout its relatively brief service in the Soviet Union, the BMP-3 proved successful in its intended roles. It later served in the Russian military and was exported to a number of other nations.
