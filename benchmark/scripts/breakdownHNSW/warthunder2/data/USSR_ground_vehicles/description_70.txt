Description of T-34-57_(1943): 
The T-34-57 (1943) (nickname: exterminator) is a fourth and late experimental variant of the T-34 medium tank family. Despite the fact that production of the T-34-57 early experimental variant was cancelled in September after only ten units had been produced, the Red Army was still highly interested in mounting a 57 mm (2.25 in) gun on T-34 tanks. The project was restarted in 1943. The Zavod imeni Stalina (ZiS) 4M (improved ZIS-4 tank gun) tank gun was placed in a T-34 (1943) variant tank with a hexagonal turret this time. This tank was dispatched to the front with the "Special Tank Company 100" on August 15, 1943, but it never saw combat. Following this, the 57 mm (2.25 in) gun design was abandoned because the new 85 mm D-5 (3.35 in) tank gun was already in production, resulting in the T-34-85 (D-5T) variant.
