History of IS-1: 
The start of the development for a new heavy tank in the Red Army came from the many criticisms of their current heavy tank, the KV-1. The KV-1 had poor mobility and a lack of firepower and armour advantage over the standard T-34, plus the KV-1 was more expensive to produce for no real advantage. Attempts to remedy this problem produced the KV-1S and the KV-85, which tried to make the KV-1 more mobile, more ergonomic, and have better firepower. Though they were improvements over the original KV-1 design, it was already determined that the KV-1 designs are to be replaced by a new heavy tank design and the newer KV-1 developments were to be interim designs until the heavy tank development is complete.
