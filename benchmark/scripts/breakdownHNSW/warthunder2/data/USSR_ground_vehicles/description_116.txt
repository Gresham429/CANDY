Description of T-10A: 
The T-10A is an improved modification of the seventh variant of the IS heavy tank family. It was a Soviet heavy tank designed as a complementary counterpart to the initial T-10 variant until a more substantial upgrade could be assembled. It was developed in the early 1950s as part of the Soviet Union's efforts to modernize its armoured forces. Compared to the IS-3, it had better armour protection, a more powerful engine, improved firepower, and the T-10A itself added a vertical stabilizer. The layout of the turret was also changed, making it much simpler to reload the ammunition for the main gun. Despite this, the upgrades were deemed insufficient, prompting the development of subsequent iterations, most notably the T-10B and T-10M, which were considered significant improvements over the T-10A and a step in the right direction for the future of the Soviet Army.
