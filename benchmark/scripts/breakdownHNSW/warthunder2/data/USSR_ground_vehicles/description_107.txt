Description of BMP-1: 
The BMP-1 (Object 764) and its upgraded variant, the BMP-1P (Object 765Sp4), were the first IFV to be mass-produced and the first major modernization of this type of vehicle respectively. They were designed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s to give mechanized infantry better mobility, firepower, and protection on the battlefield. The BMP-1 was widely exported and participated in various conflicts around the world, such as the Arab-Israeli wars, the Iran-Iraq war, the Afghan war, and the Chechen wars. The BMP-1P was introduced in the late 1970s and featured enhanced anti-tank capabilities, smoke grenade launchers and additional armour. The BMP-1P was also extensively used by Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces, as well as by some of their allies and adversaries.
