History of 2S25: 
The creation of a self-propelled anti-tank gun for the needs of the airborne forces began in the USSR in the 70s. In 1985, the requirements for the future vehicle were specified - in particular, the main weapon of the vehicle was to be a 125-mm smoothbore gun, unified with the shells of the T-72 tank. Work on the creation of the Sprut (Russian for ‘big octopus’) dragged on for 20 long years, but in September 2005, the vehicle, created on the basis of the BMD-3 IFV, was put into service. After the bankruptcy of the initial manufacturer, the 2S25 project, together with the BMD-4 produced in the same place, passed to the Kurganmashzavod, where the machine was unified with the BMD-4M and under the designation 2S25M "Sprut-SDM1" exists only in the form of prototypes. In total, from 2005 to 2010, the Russian army purchased more than 30 units of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun.
