History of T-26-4: 
The T-26-4 light tank is a variant of the T-26 light tank in Soviet services. Instead of mounting a 45 mm 20-K cannon as its main armament, the T-26-4 mounts the 76 mm KT-28 tank gun. This modification is intended to allow the T-26 to fill the role of an infantry support artillery vehicle. The turret is similar to the T-28 medium tank's turret, if not the same.
