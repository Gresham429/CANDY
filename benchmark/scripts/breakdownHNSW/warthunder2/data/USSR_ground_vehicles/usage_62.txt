Usage of SU-152: 
The SU-152 is a tank destroyer that serves many different purposes; the most accurate way to observe this vehicle is as somewhat of a "big brother" to the SU-122 and as the "cousin" of the KV-2. However, this vehicle features many differences from its closest predecessors. For example, the SU-152's BR is higher without any noticeable gain in firepower over its relatives. This presents a problem as the SU-152 will no longer be able to perform its trademark knock-outs with one hit thanks to the high-explosive rounds as often. However, unlike the other vehicles that fill the same role, the SU-152 gains access to highly effective armour piercing high explosive (APHE) ammo. This is the pinnacle of the SU-152's effectiveness. Nonetheless, turret shots with HE shells are still a viable option in combat. Due to the vehicle's BR, players are more likely to know and counter your strategy. Thus, the 152's new armour piercing rounds may come as a rude surprise.
