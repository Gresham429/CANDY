Description of Object_120: 
In the 1960s, Soviet concern over the effectiveness of the T-54/55 and T-10 tanks against the newest enemy tanks caused them to put more research into tank armament and shells for better firepower. Object 120 was one such result, considered one of the most powerful self-propelled gun (SPG) with the usage of a 152 mm cannon capable of firing APFSDS and HEAT-FS. While promising, recent development in smoothbore guns and infantry-portable missiles showed that they were able to keep up with the 152 mm cannon's penetration capabilities, and so the Object 120 dedicated SPG was not adopted.
