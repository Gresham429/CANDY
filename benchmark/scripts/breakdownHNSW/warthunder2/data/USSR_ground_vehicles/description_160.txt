Description of T-80BVM: 
The T-80BVM (Object 219RV-M) is the current spearhead of the Russian Army as the T-80BV upgraded in the late 2010s by Omsktransmash. The idea for such upgrade was likely based on the other latest MBT of Russian Army, the T-90M, which was first shown in the early 2010s as the future baseline of T-90 tanks with improved FCS, gun-laying motors, and new gun system compatible with new ammunition. In the T-80BVM's case, all front-side ERA is replaced by new Relikt ERA with better overall protection and it now shares the similar, arrowhead design of ERA placement as the T-72B3, while the sides were covered by 4S24 ERA packages (for more recent productions). The gun system is also revised to fit the latest Russian ammunition, new full-electric gun laying motors to update the tank to latest MBT standards, new French-based/domestic TVD gun sights, as well as replacing the original gas turbine engine with the higher output GTD-1250 from T-80U. Since 2018, the new T-80BVM has become the new standard for the remaining fleet of T-80BV in Russian arsenal and one of the icons of Russian Army in the 2020s.
