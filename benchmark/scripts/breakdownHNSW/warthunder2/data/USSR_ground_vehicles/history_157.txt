History of T-80UM2: 
Due to the lack of information about late-USSR equipment , the APS-equipped T-80U variant is in fact known to the Russian Army as the "T-80 with Drozd APS (ADS)". The UM2 prototype was one of the technological demonstrators for the UM upgrades of the T-80U series made in the 1990s, but economic problems seemingly hindered any further upgrades to the T-80U series.
