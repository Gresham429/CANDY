History of M4A2_(USSR): 
The Soviet participation in the United States' Lend-Lease program started in Autumn of 1941 when the United States and United Kingdom agreed to give military aid. Tanks were of particular interests to the Soviets in order to replenish their Summer losses against Germany during Operation Barbarossa. The first tanks sent were from Great Britain with Valentines and Matildas, which played a part in the Battle of Moscow.[1] The United States provided their M3 Stuart light tanks and M3 Medium tanks in late 1941/early 1942 (The two were designated M3L and M3S respectively to avoid name confusion).[2][3] These American tanks were not viewed with satisfaction, with the head of Soviet tank industry, Vyacheslav Malyshev, even considering stopping all American tank imports and focusing instead on American trucks.[4] Despite that, the Soviets were interested in America's newest medium tank, the M4 Sherman, and were eager to obtain some as soon as possible.
