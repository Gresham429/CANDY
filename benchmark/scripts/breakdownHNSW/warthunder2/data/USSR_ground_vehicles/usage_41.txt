Usage of T-126: 
Being the prototype of the T-50, the T-126 plays very similarly to it. Some major performance differences come in the T-126's construction compared to the T-50. The T-126, despite being almost 5 tons heavier than the T-50, still moves at a serviceable speed for most light tank operations. This weight difference is due to the T-126 armour being somewhat thicker at the front and sides, giving the T-126 more protection compared to the T-50 and so it translates to better protection against most small-calibre enemy projectiles. The two tanks do share a very slow turret traverse rate, slow enough that it is faster to turn the hull towards the enemy than the turret.
