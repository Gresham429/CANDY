History of SMK: 
The development of the SMK began after the T-35 heavy tank flaws came to light. The T-35 was unreliable and expensive, so the project was made to replace it. The project was headed by former OKMO designer N. Barykov and started in 1937 at the Bolshevik Plant with a specification that the tank could withstand 45 mm hits from point-blank ranges and 75 mm artillery at 1,200 m. The design drawn up in 1938 was still a multi-turret design like the T-35, but the number of turrets was reduced to just two and a wide-track torsion-bar suspension was utilized instead of a spring suspension. The SMK was also redesigned to two different prototypes, the one with two turrets and the other with a single turret installed instead. These two designs were approved by Stalin and the single turret one was named after then Soviet Defense Commissar Kliment Voroshilov as the KV, the forerunner for the KV-1 heavy tanks.
