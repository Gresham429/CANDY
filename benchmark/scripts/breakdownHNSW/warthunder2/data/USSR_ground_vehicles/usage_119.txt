Usage of T-55AMD-1: 
Do not be afraid to trust your armour, particularly when hull-down or against autocannons. However, avoid straying from your allies, as your reload can mean that a missed or poor shot is fatal. Do not count on knocking out crew to cripple opponents as your reload is long enough for knocked out members to be replaced. If you are reloading while under fire, remember to keep your gun moving to evade shots at it. The combination of APS and reliable armour means that IFVs such as the Begleitpanzer, Bradley, and Marder can do little to you without catching you off guard or getting a luck shot on your gun.
