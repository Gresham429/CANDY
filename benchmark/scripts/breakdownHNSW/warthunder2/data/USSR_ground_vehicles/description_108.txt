Description of Object_906: 
The success of the PT-76B prompted the development of a more powerful version. The Object 906 retained the same characteristics of the PT-76B: stabilized, amphibious and very light, but with a more powerful 85 mm cannon. It never went into service or serial production, but if it had, it would have received the designation PT-85. The tank carried a total of 40 shells with 8 armour-piercing and 32 HE projectiles. The protection was not the most important aspect, but it received enough armour to stop artillery fragments, 14.5 mm shots from 100 m, and it was protected against radioactive and nuclear fallout. While the tank was much superior to the PT-76B, it never went into service, it was deemed to complex to operate and produce en masse, so it was discarded and the PT-76 remained in service instead.
