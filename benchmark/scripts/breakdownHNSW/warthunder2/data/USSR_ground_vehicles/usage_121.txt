Usage of T-62M-1: 
The T-62M-1 should be played like other high tier Soviet MBTs, though with an higher emphasis on range and cover. Hide your hull and use your almost impenetrable turret armour to deflect hostile fire. If possible, try to use cover to conceal your cannon breech, as a well-placed APFSDS can disable your cannon and, depending on which side of tank you were hit from, kill your gunner or loader. A turret penetration may result in a knock out by a single shot if it hits your ammo. Do not allow yourself to fall into close-range combat areas if at all possible.
