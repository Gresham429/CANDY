Description of T-28_(1938): 
The T-28 (1938) was a Soviet medium tank developed in the early 1930s as a complement to the heavier T-35 tank, sharing turret and hull design as well as partially the armament. The T-28 was also influenced by the British Vickers A1E1 Independent multi-turreted tank. The T-28 featured three turrets, two armed with 7.62 mm DT machine guns and a third with a 76 mm KT-28 howitzer and coaxial DT machine gun. The role of the T-28 was to provide infantry support, while the BT series tanks were to deal with enemy armour.
