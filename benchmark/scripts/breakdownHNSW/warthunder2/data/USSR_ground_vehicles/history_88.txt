History of BTR-ZD: 
The BTR-ZD (Бронетранспортёр- Зенитная Десанта; lit Anti-aircraft APC for airborne troops) was based on the BTR-D APC, which was again based on the BMD-1 IFV for the VDV (Soviet/Russian Airborne Troops). After the introduction of the BMD-1 in VDV service in 1969, the vehicle was deemed too small for practical transport capabilities; so the Volgograd Tractor Factory (BMD-1's manufacturer) built a new APC for the VDV based on BMD-1, with a longer hull while removing its original turret system. The new BTR-D entered the service in 1974.
