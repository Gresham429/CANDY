Description of Shturm-S: 
The 9P149 Shturm-S was a Soviet Self-Propelled Anti-Tank Guided Missile System designed with the intent of being able to effectively destroy heavily armoured western tanks on the battlefield. It was first introduced in the late 1970s and saw widespread use by the Soviet Union and its allies during the Cold War. One of its key features was its ability to engage targets at long ranges, up to 5 kilometres, with high accuracy and precision, which was a significant advantage over other anti-tank systems of its time. The 9P149 Shturm-S also had the capability to fire missiles from a concealed position, making it difficult for enemy forces to detect and counter. This made it a highly effective weapon in mostly defensive operations. The modernised 9P149M version incorporated thermal vision systems, as well as adding the capability to fire the new and improved 9M120 Ataka missile in addition to the 9M114 Shturm (though this ability is added in separate modifications in-game).
