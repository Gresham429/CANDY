Usage of T-34-85E: 
The T-34-85E can do well in many environments with its battle role, though it is recommended to stay away from large open areas as bigger guns like the Tiger's 88 mm can chew up the T-34-85E from a long-range. Thus, it is best to stay in cover, like fighting in the forests and urban areas. Using its mobility, attempt to flank enemy tanks to hit them before they realize where the T-34-85E is. Even if caught in a frontal engagement, the 85 mm gun can dish out enough penetration to get through weak points on most enemy tanks like the Tiger I's front hull plate and the Panther's gun mantlet. In these engagement, keep little hope in hull armour and hull angling, shoot first and evade, otherwise enemy tanks will be able to destroy the T-34-85E easily.
