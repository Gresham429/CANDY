Description of T-80UM2: 
The T-80UM2 (Object 219AS-M) was a prototype of the T-80U series for possible future upgrades with Drozd hard-kill APS onboard; Omsktransmash built a prototype of T-80UM as their solution to upgrade the fleet of T-80U in Russia by late 1990s. However, the worsening economy of Russia hindered any further development of this upgrade, and the tank was only displayed during an equipment demonstration in 1997.
