History of SU-100P: 
The SU-100P was a project for an artillery piece in 1945 as well as provide anti-armour capabilities and counter battery (against enemy artillery positions). The main objective was to make it capable of destroying enemies with direct fire. As Europe and the United States were developing Self Propelled Howitzers (SPH) which could fire at close positions and relocate with speed, this was a big concern as towed artilleries were being removed and counter battery started to become a harder task. The Russian artilleries at the time did not have the enough gun elevation to accurately provide artillery support even with towed guns, thus, the main focus was to create a gun which had almost a +40Â° elevation. The gun chosen for it was the D-50 100 mm rifled bore cannon, a derivation from the widely used D-10 100 mm cannon, the main gun used on the SU-100 tank destroyer.
