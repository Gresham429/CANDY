History of IS-2: 
The effort began on another heavy tank after the IS-1's 85 mm gun no longer had a firepower advantage after the standard T-34 medium tank was upgraded with the same gun into the T-34-85. Due to that, the IS-1 was discontinued in January 1944 with about 107 units produced.[1] Those in storage still awaited upgrade to become a more powerful heavy tank.
