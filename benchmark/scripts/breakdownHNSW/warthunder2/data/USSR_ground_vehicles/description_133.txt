Description of Object_775: 
In the mid 1960s, the USSR devised a new idea for a frontline tank destroyer: a low-profile armoured tank with a gun-launcher. By utilizing multiple technologies of the time, namely hydropneumatic suspension, a drum autoloader, and a shortened gun-launcher, the profile of the vehicle could be lowered to a new extreme. The first prototype of this project, the "Object 775" was a more obscure but intriguing piece of military history. With its unique design and the ability to fire anti-tank guided missiles from a concealed, low-profile turret, the Object 775 aimed to be a formidable addition to the Soviet military's arsenal. However, the program faced various challenges, including technical issues with the drum autoloader and hydropneumatic suspension cramped in such a small vehicle, and changing military requirements and Soviet tank doctrine of the era. These hurdles ultimately led to the cancellation of the program to instead focus on the development of a new dedicated MBT armed with an autoloaded 115 mm gun firing APFSDS rounds, resulting in the Object 435 prototype for the future T-64. The Object 775's story is a reminder of the ever-evolving nature of military technology and the need for constant adaptation to meet the demands of modern warfare.
