Usage of T-V_(USSR): 
The T-V is a Soviet captured Panther A. It offers good speed and handling, along with a amazing 75 mm KwK42 cannon. The cannon is able to knock out any tank with a single shot, as it is one of the best guns in the game. One of its best shells is the PzGr 39/42, as this round offers 28.9 grams of explosive filler. Make use of the KwK 42's high muzzle velocity and potent penetration values to engage enemy from a distance in order to minimize the likelihood they hit the T-V's frontal weak points. When in combat, do not expose your sides or the sides and rear of your turret, as an enemy round will easily be able to penetrate your tank.
