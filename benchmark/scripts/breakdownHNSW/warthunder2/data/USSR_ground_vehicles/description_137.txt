Description of BMD-4: 
The BMD-4 is a Russian airborne infantry fighting vehicle developed after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a new entrant in the long-running BMD series. It uses the hull of the BMD-3, a limited production vehicle with a new chassis superior to the vintage BMD-1 chassis, and a new Bakcha-U turret with the same 100 mm + 30 mm cannon armament used by the full-size BMP-3 IFV, giving it an exceptionally heavy armament for its weight and role. Accepted into Russian service in 2004, BMD-4 production was stopped after a short initial production run due to economic difficulties. Years later, the streamlined BMD-4M with increased BMP-3 part commonality reentered production and service.
