History of MK-II_%22Matilda%22_(USSR): 
Matilda tanks were supplied to the Soviet Union as part of the Lend-Lease program. The Red Army received a third of the Matildas produced overall. Matilda heavy tanks were appreciated by the Soviet tank crews for their strong armour. A notable weak point of the tank however was its poor performance in snowy or icy conditions because of its narrow tracks.
