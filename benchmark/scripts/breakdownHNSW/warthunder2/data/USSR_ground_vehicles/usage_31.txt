Usage of KV-1S: 
When playing the KV-1S, remember that you are still a heavy tank. Keep your front armour facing your enemies at all times, and preferably angled (but slightly less than KV-1 (L-11)). The turret is more durable and can deflect more shots than before, so if possible expose your turret only. Gun has no special penetration value, so try to target weak spots or areas with the least armour. Flanking attacks could end in a fiery demise. Also, this tank is still a KV-1 in its heart.
