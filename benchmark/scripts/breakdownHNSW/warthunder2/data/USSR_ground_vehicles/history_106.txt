History of BTR-80A: 
The BTR-80 armored personnel carrier was developed with experience from using the previous vehicles of the series, BTR-60 and BTR-70, in peacetime and combat operations of the Afghan war. The vehicle received a new 260 hp engine, reinforced armor, improved fire ports for the small arms of the troops inside, as well as other improvements. The main gun of the BTR-80 remained a heavy machine gun, however, due to the low efficiency of machine gun fire against modern lightly armored targets, an improved version of the vehicle with a 30mm 2A72 autocannon appeared in 1993, designated as BTR-80A. Vehicles of the BTR-80 family took part in all major armed conflicts in the territory of the former USSR and a number of other countries. Despite the commissioning of more advanced APCs, the BTR-80A is still in service with the Russian Army to this day.
