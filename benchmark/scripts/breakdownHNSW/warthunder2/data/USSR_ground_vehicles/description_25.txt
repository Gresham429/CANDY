Description of T-34_(1941): 
The T-34 (1941) is the second variant of the T-34 medium tank family. This variant was comparable to the earlier T-34 (1940) variant. The highly efficient, long-barrelled 76.2 mm F-34 tank gun was the most significant enhancement of the T-34 (1941) variant. Many components, such as the new gun mount, the welded turret with a new, single, wide hatch, and many other elements, were evaluated for mass manufacturing. The single hatch was kept for convenience, but it was heavy and easily clogged, trapping everyone within. The crews despised it (because of the poor comfort and ergonomics), and it was promptly dubbed the "pirozhok" (stuffed bun). Another weakness in the design was the extremely big rear exhaust covers. With no special-purpose hatch or traversable periscope, the turret crews were not adequately protected in the turret.
