Description of BTR-80A: 
In the post-World War II environment, the Soviet sought to provide their infantry with a method to remain mobile on the battlefield. While armoured units received BMPs to keep the armoured infantry mobile with the tanks, motorizing rifle divisions required a cheaper, more numerous transport to house all the infantry. The BTR series of armoured cars would first be modernized with the 8x8 wheeled BTR-60 in the 1960s, with updates into the BTR-70 and BTR-80 in their respective decades. The BTR-80 was distinguished from the preceding two variants with the usage of a diesel engine and turret modifications that allowed it to elevate the main armament to a high degree to engage in mountainous terrain or urban areas. The BTR-80 would receive an update in the 1990s that added the 30 mm 2A72 autocannon as its main armament in a new turret designated BPPU.
