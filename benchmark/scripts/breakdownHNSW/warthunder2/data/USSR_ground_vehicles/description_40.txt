Description of ZiS-43: 
The ZiS-43 is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun prototype developed by the Soviets during World War II to improve anti-air capability against enemy aircraft. In 1942, a 37 mm 61K autocannon was mounted and tested on a half-track. Thin armour plates were installed throughout the vehicle to provide minor protection for the crews. It never progressed beyond the prototype stage.
