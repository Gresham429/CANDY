Description of T-55A: 
The T-55A is the second variant of the T-55 main battle tank family. It was manufactured from 1963 to 1981 and, in comparison to the previous variant, has a new anti-radiation lining as well as a full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. The use of plasticized lead sheeting for antiradiation protection was one of the most significant internal changes. To accommodate the new material, the driver's hatch was enlarged, as were the combings over the commander's and loader's hatches. The previous hull machine gun mount was removed to allow for six additional 100 mm main armament rounds. Since 1970, all T-55A variants have had a new modification that allows the 12.7mm DShK heavy machine gun to be mounted on the roof of the turret.
