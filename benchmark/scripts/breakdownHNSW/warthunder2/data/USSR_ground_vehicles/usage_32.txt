Usage of T-80: 
The T-80 is a little different from most light tanks. Like all light tanks, it has excellent speed and mobility. Unlike most light tanks it has great, sloped frontal armour and good turret armour, making it highly resistant to most tier 1 gun. Pair this with its fast firing 45 mm gun and it becomes an excellent vehicle for hunting lightly armoured foes. The addition of APCR allows you to fight more heavily armoured vehicles. You may come across Matilda and Valentine tanks, which are highly resistant to the APHEBC round but can be more easily penetrated by the APCR (at the expense of less damage).
