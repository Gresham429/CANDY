History of T-44-100: 
The T-44 started development in the Autumn of 1943 at the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, with the objective of creating a tank that is superior to the T-34. The requirement was that it have the same mobility as the T-34, but with more armour on it. In November, chief designer A. A. Morozov presented the T-44's design and model, called Object 136 as a prototype. The first prototype was completed on January the next year and two more in February. The first two prototypes are armed with the 85 mm D-5T gun with the designation T-44-85, while the last had a 122 mm D-25-44T cannon similar to the one on the IS-2 tank (Though differing from one-piece ammunition and better muzzle brake) designated the T-44-122. Overall, the design allowed the T-44 to be much more protective in armour thickness when compared to the T-34 while remaining a lower profile. Trials with the first prototypes began in February 1944. The T-44 with the 122 mm gun was deemed impractical in the trials and was discontinued while the T-44 with the 85 mm gun went on to further development. Improvements and changes went into the design until it was accepted in November 1944, where it was placed into service of the Soviet Red Army. Production started in 1944 at Factory No. 75 and continued building until 1947 with about 1,823 units produced.
