Description of Object_435: 
The Object 435 has a rather strange appearance like many other Soviet "Object" prototypes. The hull front has unusual angles that wouldn't seem out of place on the IS heavy tank family, but it has a very round turret reminiscent of the T-62. The suspension and roadwheels foreshadow the T-64. It was designed as a next-generation medium tank to potentially replace the ubiquitous T-54/55 under the name "Object 430" with new 100 mm or 115 mm U-5TS (2A20) smoothbore gun for the Object 435, but ultimately was shelved for what eventually became the T-64 (Object 432) and now stored in Kubinka Tank Museum right next to the tank that won the state certification, T-64A (Object 434).
