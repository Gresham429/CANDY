Usage of T-64B: 
The T-64B performs optimally as a sniper or support tank, utilising the low profile and long-range weapon performance. While the armour of the T-64B was good for its time, many later vehicles can fairly reliably penetrate the UFP, even through the composite armour. The gun performs well, with a good variety of ammunition, an autoloader for reliable reload times (even when a crew member is knocked, or putting out fires) and extremely high round velocity for long-range ease of use.
