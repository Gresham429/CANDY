Usage of ZiS-12_(94-KM): 
This anti-aircraft gun is used similarly as the GAZ-MM (72-K) and is armed with not one, but two 25 mm cannons that dish out twice the damage, traded for the gun shield of the former. Get to a good vantage point using the vehicle's speed, and then use the cannons to shoot down aircraft that threaten the team. Beware of any tanks or aircraft, as even machine guns can destroy the vehicle. If faced with light tanks, try to run away with the high speed of the vehicle, or try to destroy it using the cannons. The 25 mm's will offer enough penetration to go through most of a light tank's armour. A good strategy might be to flank the enemy team or an individual and attack it from the side. Caution should be paid to what tank you are shooting at, although the AP clip is effective against the side armour of most tanks this vehicle will be up against. Heavy tanks should be avoided, unless the ZiS-12 is serving as a distraction for the team or you are sure that you can penetrate their armour. Again, being shot by anything will often result in your vehicle being destroyed or put out of action. Although this vehicle is speedy, speed alone will not be enough to avoid enemy shots and machine-gun fire. One way to help mitigate the damage your vehicle might take in an engagement is by reversing up a hill, depressing your barrels over the ridge, only exposing two of your four crew members. Even if you do get shot, the driver and commander will usually survive, allowing you to escape.
