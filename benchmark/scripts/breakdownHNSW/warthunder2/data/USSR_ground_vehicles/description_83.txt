Description of SU-100P: 
The SU-100P (Object 105) was a Soviet prototype self-propelled howitzer. It was the main competitor to Object 416, which was being developed at the same time. One of its standout features was the D-50 anti-tank cannon, which was a modified D-10 with a higher muzzle velocity and was specifically designed for the vehicle. However, flaws in the design were discovered during testing. Notably, the gun, chassis, lifting mechanism, and a number of other components were discovered to be unreliable, causing numerous issues. As a result, the SU-100P faced significant challenges and required an overhaul in design to address these issues and improve its overall performance. Although the SU-100P was making significant progress, the project was ultimately canceled due to Khrushchev's views on the future of tank warfare, which did not see self-propelled guns as a viable option. But its potential wasn't fully wasted, as the chassis of the SU-100P was the basis of many other designs.
