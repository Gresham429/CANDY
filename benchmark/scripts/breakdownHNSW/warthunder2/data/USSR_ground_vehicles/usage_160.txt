Usage of T-80BVM: 
The T-80 family is known to be the first serial tanks to use gas turbine engines to propel the tank itself, earning its nickname "Flying Tank" and also marked one of its good traits - its mobility. T-80BV retained the same GTD-1000 from the previous B series while BVM upgraded its engine packs to GTD-1250 used on T-80U at higher engine output; not only this migrates the weight problem caused by extra protection and new gun systems, it can still push T-80BVM at up to 70 km/h on road. This might not be the fastest MBT in-game, but the output and power-to-weight ratio ensures T-80BVM will arrive the battle at a relatively fast pace than the T-72 series. The other traits of T-80 series is the overall good protection, especially against HEAT shells; some might even refer the tank as a fortress thanks to all the Relikt (Relics) ERA packages on the UFP and turret front, the baseline T-80BV has T-80U equivalent base protection while BVM further enhance the protection at average of 780 mm RHAe; this is currently the highest protection among all Russian-era MBTs in-game, tanks at lower tier, especially when stock, will be hopeless against T-80BVM with its lower glacis hidden from sight; the sides are covered by Relikt packages at lesser protection, but once upgraded to the "UBH" packages, the sides will also be covered by the "soft" 4S24 ERA packages extended to the center of the tank which protected the tank even from the sides at angles. While the turret is covered by Relikt as mentioned, the turret is in fact the same design from T-80B with lesser composite armor coverage, oncoming shots will still have the chance to completely disable the turret or the gun. For firepower, the gun is now replaced by the new 2A46M-1 and revised autoloader for new Russian ammunitions including the 3BM60 APFSDS and 9M119M1 ATGM; in most cases, unless T-80BVM runs into ZTZ99 series or Strv 122 series, the selection of both high-velocity APFSDS and tandem ATGM is more than enough to defeat NATO tanks from long distance, which is further enhanced by the new FCS with 3rd generation TVD and sufficient magnification. Sometimes, when players run into a sudden strike, some enemies will leisurely turn their gun onto T-80BVM from the stereotypes of the inferior gun handlings, this problem has been eliminated on T-80BVM thanks to the new electric gun laying motors that could travel up to 40Â° bi-directional. With these traits, some might even consider T-80BVM as an undefeatable fortress; but there are still some Achilles heels to be exploited with.
