Description of T-26: 
The T-26 was based in the British Vickers 6 ton tank. Developed during the 1930s, the T-26 soon became the primary light tank of the Soviet Red Army. It saw combat during the Spanish Civil War and the Winter War, with mixed results due to poor leadership and tactics. Even though it was outclassed by the start of World War 2, it saw extensive use in the first year alongside the BT cavalry tanks, with heavy losses against the far superior Panzer III and Panzer IV. It was produced between 1931 and 1941, with different variants, command tanks, artillery variants, flamethrower tanks and many others, with a total sum of 12,000 units produced.
