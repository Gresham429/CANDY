Description of T-62: 
The T-62 is the first variant of the T-62 main battle tank family. The first T-62 variant, a further development of the T-55 main battle tank family, retained many design elements of its predecessor, including a low profile and thick turret armour. Unlike previous Soviet main battle tanks, which were armed with rifled tank guns, the T-62 was the first production tank to be armed with a smoothbore tank gun capable of firing armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds at much higher velocities. While the T-62 quickly became the Soviet Union's new standard armoured spearhead, it did not completely replace the T-55 in export markets due to higher manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements than its predecessor.
