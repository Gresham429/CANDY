Description of BTR-152A: 
The BTR-152A is the first variant of the BTR-152-based self-propelled anti-aircraft gun family. Two 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns are mounted in a turret on a BTR-152 and are manually operated by a single soldier. The turret is installed inside the troop compartment and is manually reloaded by other soldiers. The BTR-152 is a Soviet armoured personnel carrier (APC) with six wheels based on the chassis and drive train of a ZIS-151 utility truck. Beginning in 1950, it saw service with several Warsaw Pact member states and served as the mainstay of Soviet motor rifle battalions until the 1960s.
