Description of T-V_(USSR): 
The â–‚T-V (also seen as "Panther" in-game) is a premium gift rank IV Soviet medium tank 
with a battle rating of 6.0 (AB/RB/SB). It was available as a prize during the 2015 Thunder League eSports tournament, first as a giveaway prize for watching the Twitch stream, but then every Dog-Tag owner for the tournament earned one when the tournament prize pool reached its $50,000 goal. Though it has the external looks and automotive performance of a Panther Ausf. A, it does not have access to APCR, unlike its German counterpart.  As a premium Panther tank in-game, it is a deadly opponent in the battlefield.
