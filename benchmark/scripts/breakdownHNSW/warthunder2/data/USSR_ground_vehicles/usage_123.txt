Usage of T-10M: 
Despite being a heavy tank, the T-10M is only able to stop full calibre shells in which, at the battle rating, there is none but in some cases at 7.3 and 7.7. Due to this, the T-10M is far from being a frontline tank, meaning it has to stay away from the enemy line of sight (LoS) due to the long reload and weak armour. This does not mean it should be taken all the way through the outskirts of a map to get into position (can be done but not recommended on all maps). It should be used as a sniper in long range maps and a support vehicle in the rest. It is able to defend itself pretty well if a good defensive position is found or set. All close quarters combat (CQC) should be avoided as the extremely long reload speed invites enemy tanks to flank you from all sides. Some places in CQC environments (urban areas, city ravines, etc.) can be used as choke point (holding a full street waiting for someone to push if that street is the only access point) due to its powerful gun and decent armour. This tank faces almost nothing that can be a hard cookie to crack.
