Usage of PT-76-57: 
The PT-76-57 performs extremely well in the support role, or as a flanker type of vehicle. In smaller maps, try to avoid face-to-face confrontations with heavy tanks, as it will quickly get your vehicle destroyed. Instead, try to secure a good position near a cap point, or flank to a side route to surprise passing tanks. As a support tank, stick with friendly tanks, scouting and helping to repair as needed. Disable tanks for allies to finish when you can't, and destroy more lightly armoured targets. This tank performs exceptionally well as a flanker as well, as it is fairly mobile and can easily take out tanks from the sides. If a more aggressive playstyle suits you better, rush a capture point, find a secure position, and destroy enemies pushing into it.
