Usage of IS-4M: 
The IS-4M is a direct successor to the IS-3, and it features even more armour, so much armour that some APDS and APFSDS cannot penetrate its UFP and most of the turret, needless to say this tank is practically invulnerable to conventional rounds from the front. Unfortunately the gun remains the same 122 mm D-25T that is featured on all IS-series tanks from the IS-2, and at its BR it isn't enough sometimes, while other times a weird bounce can still lead to some good hits. Overall, though, this tank feels much better at its BR than the IS-3, which has a huge shot trap.
