Usage of 2S1: 
The 2S1's biggest weakness is high fire rate guns such as AA and other howitzers as both can eviscerate your vehicle very quickly. In RB, it is suggested to use your howitzer as it was intended: long distance destruction. Use your speed to get to vantage points. The 2S1 does not have much gun depression so you will need to use the environment for your own concealment and gun shooting angles.
