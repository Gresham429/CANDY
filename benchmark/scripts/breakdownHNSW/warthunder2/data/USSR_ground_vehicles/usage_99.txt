Usage of Type_62_(USSR): 
With its excellent mobility, the Type 62 is great for getting from point to point and setting up ambushes. However, the reload rate is around the same or even slower than most enemy tanks, so making your first shot count is always going to determine whether you survive the engagement or not. Aiming for the turret or ammo racks of the enemy are great options, as they usually ensure ammo rack detonations or that the enemy won't be able to fire back at you if not.
