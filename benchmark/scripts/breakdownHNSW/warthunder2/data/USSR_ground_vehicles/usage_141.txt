Usage of T-72B_(1989): 
The T-72B (1989) playstyle is near identical to the T-72B but starts to give T-90A vibes due to ERA. This tank has the exact same modules, sights and combat systems as the previous T-72B. However, it has access to Kontakt-5 (K5) ERA, increasing not only the chemical protection of the tank against missiles and shaped charges but also solid shots like darts.
