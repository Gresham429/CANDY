Description of RBT-5: 
The RBT-5 was a Soviet light tank prototype with rocket launchers. It used the BT-5 chassis equipped with so-called tank torpedoes (TT-250), which were 420 mm in caliber and weighed 250 kg each. They could blast enemy forts and heavy tanks within 1800 m. The NIAP developed the rockets in 1931-1932. The RBT-5 tested them in 1932 near Leningrad, but they were inaccurate and unstable. The tank also lost speed and agility due to its weight. The RBT-5 project ended in 1933 after a few prototypes. The tank torpedoes were later towed or fixed for use in the Winter War and World War II.
