Description of Object_248: 
The Object 248 was a proposed modification to the aging IS-1 with the intention of equipping it with a 100 mm gun. There were two distinct versions. The first to arrive was Object 245, armed with a D-10 cannon, followed by Object 248, armed with an S-34. They were tested in the second half of 1944. At the beginning, they were considered a failure, as the modifications did not improve the performance of the IS-1 but rather made it even worse. It was discovered that the guns were unstable and could be damaged due to weak gun cradles, and the tank commander could be hit by the breech of the gun while it was rolling back after being fired. These were not fully addressed until the end of the year, when the majority of the design flaws were corrected. Unfortunately, it was considered too late, as both German and Soviet forces had already developed more advanced tanks that outperformed both tanks, and production was promptly cancelled.
