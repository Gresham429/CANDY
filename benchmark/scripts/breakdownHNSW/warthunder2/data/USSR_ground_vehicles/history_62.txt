History of SU-152: 
During Operation Uranus, when the Soviet Army was able to successfully encircle the German Sixth Army inside Stalingrad, there were some weaknesses pointed out in their armoured formations. One was the need for heavy guns that could also be mobile, as there were many German fortifications that were unable to be handled by the front-line troops. The Soviet heavy artillery at the time, the 152 mm howitzer, was very heavy and could not be effectively towed from place to place due to unsuitable terrain and lack of capable transportation. Though they experimented with a propelled version of the gun with the KV-2, the tank was phased out of production by October 1941. In November 1942, the State Defense Committee attempted to fix this by ordering the development of a heavy self-propelled gun with the 152.4 mm ML-20 howitzer as its main armament and was to have greater mobility, armour, and better production cost.
