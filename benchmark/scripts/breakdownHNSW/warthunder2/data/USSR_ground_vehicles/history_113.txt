History of IS-6: 
The Chelyabinsk Kirov Plant Work (ChKZ) began drafting the designs of a new heavy tank on 02 May 1944[1] with an electrotransmission, a drive system that was used on the German Ferdinand/Elefant. The plant was officially ordered to begin work on June 08[2] for two versions of the heavy tank, with emphasis of having significant advantages over the current IS-2 heavy tank. The heavy tank was designated as the IS-6 and the two versions were the Object 252 with a mechanical transmission and the Object 253 with a electric transmission.[3] Both prototypes were produced in the Fall of 1944 and were sent to be tested at the NIIBT testing grounds at Kubinka.
