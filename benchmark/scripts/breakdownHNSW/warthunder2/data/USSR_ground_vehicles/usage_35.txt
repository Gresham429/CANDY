Usage of SU-122: 
The main feature of this SPG is a powerful gun, but make good use of the first shot. It is very hard to hit targets from over 500 m in realistic and simulator battles since shell velocity is slow and shell drop is significant. The cannon's HEAT shell has excellent destructive power and higher penetration than its HE shell (and in fact can penetrate almost anything it will face), but it also has a slower shell velocity than the HE shell. Practice makes aiming at long distances easier, but it is still recommended to stay at close to medium range when possible. One tactic would be to rush an enemy tank and shoot it at point-blank range, but this only works if there are no other enemy tanks nearby because with an untrained crew it can take up to 33 seconds before the SU-122 has reloaded.
