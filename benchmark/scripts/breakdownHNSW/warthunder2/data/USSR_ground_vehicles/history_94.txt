History of T-34-100: 
Issued in large numbers in 1940, the T-34 became largely known as one of the best medium tanks of World War II. At its introduction, there was nothing comparable in any other army in the World, the Germans were still with their Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs while the Americans had access to their inter-war period M2 medium tank and M3 Stuart light tanks. The T-34 featured a frontal armour plate of 45 mm thick but sloped at 60 degrees to create a 90 mm effective armour, a lot more than its contemporaries. The addition of a 76.2 mm gun also gave the T-34 a much better firepower advantage than other tanks as well. Its superiority in armour, mobility, and firepower caught the Germans by surprise when Operation Barbarossa was launched, and they found that many of their anti-tank weapons available were unable to destroy the T-34. However, poor unit coordination and crew training with the T-34 gave them little opportunities to be used in the most efficient way possible against the Germans.
