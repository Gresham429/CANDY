Usage of T-72B3: 
As one of the most-produced MBT in Russia, T-72B series received extensive upgrades throughout the 21st century; which T-72B3 inherited the protection of post-1989 models with Kontakt-5 ERA blocks on both the chassis and turret, making its performance identical to its 10.0 counterpart. After T-72B3M (UBH modification) upgrades in 2016, players will find the tank very similar to the flying fortress from Leningrad/Omsk - T-80BVM with 4S24 "soft-case" ERA packs on the sides, as well as rear fences around the engine bay. While it lacks the mobility of T-80 series, the overall protection will still prove useful at top-tier battles with careful planning.
