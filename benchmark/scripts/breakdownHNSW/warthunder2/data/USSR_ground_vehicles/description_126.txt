Description of T-64B: 
The T-64B is the third variant of the T-64 main battle tank family. It has many improvements over its predecessor, including a redesigned armour layout, a better 1A33 fire control system, a new 9K112-1 "Kobra" ATGM system, an improved 125 mm 2A46-2 tank gun, a 2E26M two-plane fully automatic stabilisation system, and a new 6ETs40 autoloader. T-64B variants were fitted with stronger upper hull glacis armour beginning in 1985, and older T-64B variants were upgraded with a 16 mm armour plate.
