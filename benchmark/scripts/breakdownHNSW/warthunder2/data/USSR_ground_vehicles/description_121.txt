Description of T-62M-1: 
The T-62M-1 is an armoured modification of the T-62, which is the first variant of the T-62 main battle tank family. It is outfitted with a BDD appliqué armour package, an additional belly armour plate for anti-mine protection, 10 mm thick reinforced rubber side skirts, and a 10 mm thick anti-neutron liner as part of an extensive modernization package aimed at improving protection, mobility, and firepower. The BDD appliqué armour package increases frontal armour protection to nearly that of the first variant of the T-64 and T-72 main battle tank families. This appliqué armour package includes an appliqué plate on the glacis and two horseshoe-shaped blocks fitted to the front of the turret, which has been proven to be effective against all 84mm and 90mm tank rounds at all ranges, as well as a selection of 105mm armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunitions. The "Volna" fire control system was enhanced by mounting the KTD-2 laser rangefinder in an armoured box above the main armament. Finally, the tank has a new TShSM-41U gunner's sight, a new commander's sight, a "Meteor-M1" two-plane fully automatic stabilisation system, a BV-62 ballistic computer, and a 9K116-2 "Sheksna" anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) unit with 1K13-BOM sight, allowing it to fire 9M117 Bastion ATGMs through its tank gun. The T-62M-1 is a further enhancement from the base modification that includes a V-46-5M diesel engine.
