Usage of T-80B: 
The T-80B should be played like a T-64B, using your powerful gun and decent armour to pick off enemies in the distance. When needed, the T-80B can perform flanking runs with its decent speed. However, the T-80B should not be played like an M1 Abrams, as the tank will explode when anything penetrates your armour.
