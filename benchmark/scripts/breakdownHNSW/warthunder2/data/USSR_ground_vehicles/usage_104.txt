Usage of IS-3: 
The IS-3, continuing the tradition of the Soviet IS line of heavy tanks, sports a powerful 122 mm cannon, strong frontal armour and reasonable mobility for its class. As with its predecessors, it excels at dispatching anything it can penetrate with its explosive-filled rounds, and relies heavily on its excellent reverse speed and sharply angled armour to keep itself out of trouble. However, an IS-3 commander will increasingly encounter HEAT, HESH and ATGMs which pose a serious threat to the vehicle. The IS-3 also has a rather exposed and exploitable trap-shot directly under the gun barrel when the turret is facing directly forward, which even conventional rounds can use. It is also recommended to make sure that the enemy tank has around the same height advantage as you, as the armour plate on top of the gun breech can be penetrated by enemy shells shot from above, damaging the gun breech and possibly killing your tank.
