Usage of BTR-ZD: 
Due to being made out of ABT-101 aluminium alloy and the thickest area of the armour being 32 mm at the front of the vehicle, a head on engagement with a ground vehicle is not recommended, especially against vehicles with high-calibre machine guns or autocannons. If used against ground targets, make good use of the BTR-ZD's high mobility and flank the enemies to avoid being immediately sent back to the hangar. Most HE rounds will decimate the vehicle right away, even if it somehow survives the hit, the exposed crew will not have a good day. When facing heavier targets (such as Churchills), chances are the autocannons onboard with relatively low penetration will be practically useless against any WWII heavy tanks, so either disable their tracks or just avoid them at all costs. When encountering vehicles with strong frontal armour but weak side armour (such as the Hetzer) try to flank and take them out by shooting at their sides.
