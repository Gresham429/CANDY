Usage of T-34_(1940): 
This is the first non-premium model of the T-34 series. It's a powerful breakthrough tank in the right hands due to its battle rating, good armour and powerful gun but is prone to get heavily damaged or destroyed from shots to the turret ring or cheeks. Keep moving, using its high speed and manoeuvrability, and get close to guaranteeing a penetration and angle the armour to easily bounce shells from enemy tanks.
