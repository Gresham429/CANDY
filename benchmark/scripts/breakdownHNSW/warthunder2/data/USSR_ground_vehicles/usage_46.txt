Usage of T-34E: 
In ground RB, T-34E can be used in many styles, it can either be a flanker or it can be a front line attacker, it can even be a sniper at times. But no matter what style you play, always angle the armour to avoid being penetrated and remember that you always have the choice to cover the tank with decorations to further confuse the enemy.
