Description of IT-1: 
The IT-1 was a Soviet anti-tank missile carrier designed with the intent of being fielded as a mobile and effective anti-tank weapon system. It was developed in the 1960s and was based on the chassis of the T-62. It was equipped with a 3M7 'Drakon' ATGM specifically designed for the vehicle. The missile had a range of up to 3 kilometers and could penetrate armor up to 500mm thick. The radio-based SACLOS guidance system used by the IT-1 allowed the operator to guide the missile using any one of the seven given frequencies and two codes. While the idea sounded promising, the IT-1 was criticized for a number of reasons, including the weight of the guidance equipment, the complexity of the guidance system, and the significant deadzone around the tank caused by the missiles' minimum range. Unfortunately, these flaws contributed to its widespread unpopularity, which ultimately caused the IT-1 to be phased out after only five years.
