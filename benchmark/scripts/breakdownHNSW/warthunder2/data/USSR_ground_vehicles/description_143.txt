Description of T-72B3: 
The T-72B3 (Object 184M-3) is an up-gunned and armoured modification of the T-72B, which is the third variant of the T-72 main battle tank family. To simplify supply lines, old stocks of T-72B variants held in reserve were upgraded with components used in the new T-90 main battle tank family in 2010. The modernisation program (as the T-72B3M; post-2016 production) focuses primarily on the implementation of a new fire control system, in addition to performing an extensive upgrade on every tank, such as more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment, and new universal, twin-pin tracks. While the tank commander's sight retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, the gunner's sight now has access to thermal imaging equipment as well as the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which is a multi-channel, panoramic sight with a built-in laser rangefinder.
