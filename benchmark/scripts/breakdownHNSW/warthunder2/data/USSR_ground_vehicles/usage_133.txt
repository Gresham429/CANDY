Usage of Object_775: 
The Object 775 plays very similarly to the IT-1, another Soviet missile-only tank. However, unlike the IT-1, the Object 775 can also engage somewhat effectively in the CQC if needed. Like most ATGM tank destroyers, being only equipped with the Rubin anti-tank missile can put the Object 775 at a disadvantage in many situations when facing conventional enemies armed with a cannon, but it does have the capacity to excel in certain situations, like setting ambushes.
