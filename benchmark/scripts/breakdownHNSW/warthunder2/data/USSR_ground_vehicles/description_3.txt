The BT-7M was a Soviet light tank, developed from the previous BT-5 light tank. Both designs shared the same 45 mm 20-K cannon aswell as coaxial DT machine gun. Unlike the BT-5, the BT-7s hull was welded and the shape of hull at front was also redesigned. The frontal armour protection was slightly increased from 13 to 20 mm of armour. New turret turret featuring sloped armour was also adopted. Unlike BT-7, the BT-7M features diesel powered V-2 engine giving it more horsepower, range and better acceleration unlike the gasoline powered BT-7.
