Description of T-90A: 
The T-90A is the first variant of the T-90 main battle tank family. Intended to replace the T-72 main battle tank family as the new armoured spearhead, it features many improvements, such as a new 125 mm 2A46 tank gun, the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and advanced gunner's sight with thermal imaging equipment. Standard protection measures include steel and composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour (ERA), and the Shtora-1 infrared anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) jamming system. When a weapon-guidance laser is directed at the tank, the jamming system first warns and highlights the direction for the tank's crew. After the crew has directed the turret to face the threat, the infrared jammer, TShU1-7 EOCMDAS, jams the semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) guidance system used by some anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) to neutralize the threat.
