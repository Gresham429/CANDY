Description of T-26E: 
The T-26E was a Soviet light tank developed from the T-26 in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The T-26E (ekranirovanny, "screened") was an uparmoured version featuring appliqu√© armour based on the experiences gained in the Winter War, developed by Leningrad Factory No.174. The factory tests proved that the uparmoured T-26 was able to resist hits from 45 mm anti tank guns at a distance of 400 to 500 metres. The armour plates were bolted and welded onto the hull and turret, increasing the armour protection to 45 mm all around. 89 of these T-26s were made by Factory No. 174. Further field modifications inspired by this were conducted by various field workshops and factories after the German attack on Soviet Union in 1941.
