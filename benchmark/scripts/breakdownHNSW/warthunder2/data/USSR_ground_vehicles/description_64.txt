Description of ISU-152: 
The ISU-152 is a Soviet self-propelled heavy howitzer used during World War II. It is very similar to the SU-152, mounting the same 152 mm ML-20S howitzer on an IS heavy tank chassis. Since the main armament was mounted in a casemate, it required repositioning the entire vehicle using the tracks, which made it awkward to aim. To support more mobile infantry and armour attacks, it was employed as mobile artillery rather than directly engaging the enemy itself. It was employed in numerous campaigns and nations well into the 1970s.
