Description of Strela-10M2: 
The ZRK 9A35M2 "Strela-10M2" (Lit. Arrow; NATO codename: SA-13 Gopher) is one of the missile systems that composed the extensive air-defence layers of Soviet and Warsaw Pact ground forces. As the direct upgrade of the previous 9K31 Strela-1 systems, the Strela-10M2 systems were developed as a stop-gap before the new ZPRK 2S6 system could be developed by the 1970s; however, the system was not very reliable against jets of its era during field tests and was delayed to mid-1970s for deployment. The systems, which could be said as the close layer of the air-defense network for the army corps, are still being used by many ex-Soviet republics with upgrades introduced to the missile seeker for better counter-ECCM capabilities.
