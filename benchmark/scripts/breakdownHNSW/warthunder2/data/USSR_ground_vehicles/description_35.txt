Description of SU-122: 
The SU-122 was a World War II-era Soviet self-propelled assault gun. Mounted on a T-34 medium tank chassis, the main armament consists of a 122 mm M-30S howitzer. After the German Sturmgesch√ºtz III assault guns proved successful, the Soviet High Command became interested in this concept. Compared to conventional tanks, assault guns had certain advantages. Their lack of a turret allowed for a lower production cost. On the same chassis, they could be equipped with bigger and more potent weapons and constructed with a larger fighting compartment. However, unlike conventional tanks, assault guns usually aim by orienting the entire vehicle, making them less effective in close-quarters fighting.
