Description of SU-100Y: 
The SU-100Y was developed after the failure of the T-100 in the Winter War. The vehicle was intended to fill a similar purpose as that of the KV-2, basically disable enemy fortifications with a heavy gun, a 130mm naval gun was thus installed into the vehicle, although a 152mm one was also proposed. While the tank was being service, its prototype was rushed to defend Moscow, the tank never made it into serial production and no combat records of it are known, but it is still preserved at the Kubinka Tank Museum.
