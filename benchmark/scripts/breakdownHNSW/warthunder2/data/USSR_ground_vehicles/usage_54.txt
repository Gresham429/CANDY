Usage of SU-85A: 
In realistic battles, this vehicle plays best from the sidelines in a support role. It does not possess the speed to rush anywhere, even if it is not slow. It does not have the ability to take a hit without enduring crippling damage. It can hide behind walls and relatively low cover and remain hidden where a taller light or medium tank would likely be spotted. Its gun is superior to other guns at its BR range, such as American short 75 and 76 mm guns commonly found on Shermans and German 75 mm guns found on Panzer IV's. As such, the SU-85A can typically penetrate most tanks it battles against through their frontal armour out to distances in excess of a kilometre.
