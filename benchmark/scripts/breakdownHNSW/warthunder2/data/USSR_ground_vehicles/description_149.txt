Description of 2S6: 
The ZPRK 2S6 "Tunguska" [Зенитный ракетно-пушечный комплекс](GRAU: 2K22; NATO codename: SA-19 "Grison") is one of the composition of Soviet and Russia's field air-defense system as the direct replacement of ZSU-23-4 which was not capable to handle late-Cold War attackers (both fixed-wing and helicopters). As the conclusion that larger calibre autocannon can achieve higher kill probability against jets, Soviet Army also seek for a combined system with missile onboard as well; although the development started as early as 1970, due to the introduction of new missile systems with better range, the development was slowed down until the conclusion from Arab-Israeli War was drawn that gun systems have better reaction time than sole-missile systems (due to the warm-up process of both radar and missiles). Eventually the joint efforts of different Soviet designers was fruited in 1982 as the 2K22 (while the mobile battery itself is named 2S6) and eventually joined the Army in 1984 as another composition of the short-range defense layer alongside with ZSU-23-4, SA-10 Strela-10M2 and SA-8 Osa. The vehicle also received upgrades during its production and likely inspired later systems like 96K6 Pantsir-S1 with more advanced electronics and missile system.
