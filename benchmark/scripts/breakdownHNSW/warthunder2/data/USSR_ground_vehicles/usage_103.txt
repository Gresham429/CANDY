Usage of T-54_(1951): 
The T-54 (1951) is practically the same tank as the T-54 (1949), it has the same armour as the T-54 (1949) and the only difference is the addition of the new HEATFS round capable of going through 380 mm of armour (the War Thunder community generally accepts the T-54 (1951) as having the best ammunition overall). Again, the new round should be taken as a back-up option for the most armoured enemies, while the BR-412D should remain the main round.
