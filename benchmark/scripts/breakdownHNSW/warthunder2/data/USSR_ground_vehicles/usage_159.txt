Usage of T-90M: 
The T-90M should be played somewhat cautiously across Arcade, Realistic and Simulator battles due to its poor mobility and gun depression of -6Â°. However if played cautiously, the T-90M is an amazing tank having both ample amounts of armor and firepower, which can easily and swiftly take on its two main rivals, being the M1A2 SEPV2 and the Leopard 2A7V.
