Description of T-34E_STZ: 
The T-34E STZ is an armoured modification of the T-34 (1941), which is the second variant of the T-34 medium tank family. When the Germans were confronted with the significantly better-protected T-34 medium tanks during Operation Barbarossa, they promptly began improving their current designs to combat it. In response, many early T-34 variations, such as the T-34E STZ ("ehkranami" - screened), had additional armour plates welded to the front in an attempt to improve the tank's protection. The frontal hull protection was significantly increased over the original T-34 (1941) variant. This modification was principally performed in the STZ factory in Stalingrad in January 1942.
