History of Object_268: 
The Object 268 self-propelled gun was one of the many derivative designs of the T-10 heavy tank. The concept began on 2 July 1952 at the Leningrad Kirov Plant on the order of the Council of Ministers USSR.[1] The Object 268 would follow in the same line of doctrine as had the earlier Soviet self-propelled guns of World War II, the SU-100, -122, and -152. This contrasted with the Western concept of a self-propelled gun being used as an artillery piece rather than the Soviet usage as a tank destroyer.[1] There had been earlier attempts at converting a heavy tank to a self-propelled gun, using the chassis of the IS-4 and IS-7, but those had not been fully developed and were cancelled. The IS-4 production was running too slowly and the IS-7 had been too complex to manufacture in large numbers.[2] The Leningrad Kirov Plant worked to produce an SPG on the T-10 chassis by combining it with the 152 mm M-48 cannon, which had high velocity and was much more powerful than earlier 152 mm cannons. Drawing work led to the Object 730 SPG which would be paired with the M-53 cannon, a parallel development to the M-48.[3]
