Description of KV-1E: 
In 1940, a new variant of the venerable KV-1 heavy tank appeared on the frontlines of the Eastern front. This new KV had ditched its older, weak L-11 cannon in favour of a F-32 gun, similar to those found on the T-34s of the time. However, the biggest upgrade was its add-on armour. By riveting large steel plates to the hull's weakspots and the turret faces, the KV-1 suddenly became almost impenetrable to its enemies, with the German army having to call in air support or heavy towed 88 mm field guns every time one of these 1940 model KVs was encountered.
