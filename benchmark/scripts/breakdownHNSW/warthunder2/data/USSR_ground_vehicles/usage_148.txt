Usage of Strela-10M2: 
As a powerful SPAA, the 9A35M2 Strela-10M2 has a very irritating weakness. Due to the lack of supporting vehicles of common Soviet AA batteries especially radar vehicles, players will have to rely on crew voices, the sound of rotor/jet or visual acquisition of enemy aircraft. As such, the best way to use the Strela-10M2 is as a short-range surprise weapon against enemy aircraft and helicopters. The missiles cannot reach as far as many of the radar missile-equipped SPAA vehicles you will often be playing alongside, but they have very good overload and do not give the enemy a radar warning. Engaging aircraft that are busy with other targets or just starting to exit the battlefield is the best way to engage, as distracted enemies are less likely to see the missile and dump flares.
