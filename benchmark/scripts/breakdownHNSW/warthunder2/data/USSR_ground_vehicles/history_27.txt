History of T-34E_STZ: 
The T-34 was beginning to become the main tank of the Soviet Army by 1941, however, the initiation of Operation Barbarossa by the Germans postponed most manufacturing deadlines due to the relocation of various factories to the Ural Mountains to keep them safe from the Germans. During the movement, only the Dzherzhinski Tractor Factory in Stalingrad (STZ) stayed in production and produced most of the T-34s during the relocation.
