History of T-54_(1951): 
The T-54 mod. 1951 was the final product of the T-54 family and the transition to early T-55 models. It featured the exact same hull, gun, NBC systems and fire control systems of the previous T-54 but with the TSh-2-22 telescopic gunner's sight. The mod. 1951 featured a turret redesign which removed the turret side undercuts, replaced radio with a new R-113 radio, reduced weight as the extra 20 mm has been removed, additional fuel tanks, fume extractor and addition of the TDA smoke generating system.
