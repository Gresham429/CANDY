History of T-34-85E: 
In the final months of World War II, the T-34-85 was still very adequate as a medium tank, but the high casualties suffered by the fanatic defenders of Germany and their anti-tank weapons made the crew seek out a way to increase the tank's survivability against these infantry weapons. The crew improvised in the field modifications, and one of the method to shield the T-34s was to apply thin metal sheets or mesh screens onto the T-34 body in hopes that it would disrupt the warheads of Panzerfaust or Panzershreck before it detonates on the hull. These improvised T-34-85s were called T-34-85E with "E" for "ekranami" or "with screens".
