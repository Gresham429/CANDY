History of IT-1: 
The genesis of the concept of "missile tanks" came from the Premier of the Soviet Union at the time, Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev believed that missiles were the key to armour dominance, spelling the end of naval battleships and tanks. This belief led to his order that the heavy tank programs like the T-10 be cancelled in the 1950s. Khrushchev ordered that a missile-capable tank be fielded in replacement, with development starting in 1956 despite the immature technology. Though the military finds little favour with the concept, they begrudgingly carry it out by orders of the Kremlin and many facilities in the Soviet Union started on the concept.[1]
