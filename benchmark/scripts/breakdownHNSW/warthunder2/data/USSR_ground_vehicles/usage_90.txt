Usage of KV-122: 
While this tank is classified as a heavy tank, avoid driving it towards the front lines as the armour is not as strong as your sister heavy tanks and your speed is low as well. Instead, play a support role in backing up your stronger heavy tanks when down-tiered; when up-tiered, you can get away with brawling on the front lines so long as you manage to angle your armour properly.
