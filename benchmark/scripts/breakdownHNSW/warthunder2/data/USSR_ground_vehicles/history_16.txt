History of SU-57: 
The SU-57 began as the T48 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage from the United States. This is similar to their previous anti-tank vehicle the 75 mm GMC M3, which mounted a 75 mm M1897A4 gun instead. The development started from a British and American requirement for a vehicle mounting the 6-pounder gun. This was fulfilled with the 57 mm gun M1 (A US version of the 6-pounder) and this was installed on the rear of an M3 Half-track. Orders came in at April 1942, but the Americans soon drop theirs after the M10 GMC was put into production. Thus, the T48 was to be lend-leased to Allied countries and was never classified in the American inventory.
