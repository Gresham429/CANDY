Usage of T-34-100: 
The T-34-100 retains the mobility, agility, and armour of the T-34-85 and combines it with a much more powerful gun only seen on tank destroyers in the same rank. However, its overall performance is limited by the fact that its armour is essentially paper-thin against the kind of guns the enemies can field at this rank.
