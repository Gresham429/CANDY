History of Object_435: 
The prototype Object 435 medium tank was the most advanced in a series of experimental tanks being developed by Kharkov plant No. 75 under the "new medium tank" program at the very beginning of the 1960s. The Object 435 became a test vehicle for the newly developed 115mm U-5TS Molot unitary-loading smoothbore cannon that was later installed on tanks of the T-62 family. The tank had a short hull and an original hull armor layout at the front, which was supposed to provide the vehicle with a high level of protection against kinetic munitions. The Object 435 was canceled in 1961 in favor of another prototype, Object 432. A survivor Object 435 tank is on display at Patriot park near Moscow.
