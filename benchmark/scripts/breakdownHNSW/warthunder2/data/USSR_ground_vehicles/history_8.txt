History of T-60: 
In 1938, a task to create an amphibious and non-amphibious scout tank was given to Nicholas Astrov's design team at Moscow Factory No. 37. The result was the T-30A and T-30B prototypes, with the A model being amphibious. The T-30A went on to become the T-40 amphibious scout tank, while the T-30B went on to become the T-60 scout tank. Production started on July 1941, one month after the German invasion in Operation Barbarossa.
