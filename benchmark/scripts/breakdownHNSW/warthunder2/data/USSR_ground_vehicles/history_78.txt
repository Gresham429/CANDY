History of T-44: 
The Soviet Union tank T-34 began production at the end of 1940, but there were already plans to upgrade the T-34 design as early as 1941 by incorporating modern technology.[1] The first of these projects was the T-34M, which would have thicker armour, a three-man turret, torsion bar suspension, road wheels with shock absorbers, increased fuel capacity, and more ammo storage. The design also had the driver and assistant driver spots switched, but still retaining the large driver hatch on the front glacis. Four return rollers were also added and a 12-cylinder diesel engine producing 600 horsepower was used along with an 8-speed transmission system. The design used a traverse engine placement, making the design smaller than the original T-34, yet giving the crew more workspace in the tank. While the development underway to constructing armour plates, the project was placed on hold with Nazi Germany's invasion in Operation Barbarossa and all production facilities were mass-producing the T-34s to counter the invasion.
