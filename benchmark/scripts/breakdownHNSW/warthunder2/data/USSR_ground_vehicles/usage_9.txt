Usage of T-70: 
Unlike later tanks, the T-70 presents a strange configuration: motor and turret are side by side, meaning that exposing the tank's back will not immobilize it. With its turret definitively leaning to the left, a smart player will prefer going around corners with the obstacle on the right side of the tank. This tactic has two effects: it decreases the size of the target for the enemy and protects the crew with the engine block, at the expense of being immobilized if shot from the right side. Try to avoid being shot to the left side since there is a big ammo rack on the whole left side of the vehicle. The rocky suspension puts T-70 at a disadvantage in sudden one-on-one encounters, so rushing for the nearest piece of cover instead of stopping to take aim may be a better option, unless the enemy is unaware of the light tank. Any player familiar with low-rank tanks will be comfortable with the 45 mm 20-K cannon. Some peculiarities to the T-70 is its good gun depression of -6Â° and slow turret traverse.
