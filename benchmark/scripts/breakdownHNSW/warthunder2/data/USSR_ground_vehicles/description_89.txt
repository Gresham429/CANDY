Description of M53/59: 
The M53/59, known as Praga PLDvK vz. 53/59-"Ještěrka" (Praga twin-cannon AA Model 53/59 "Lizard") in Czech, is an ex-Czechoslovak SPAA built from the chassis of a Praga V3S truck with a pair of 30 mm ZK453 autocannon onboard. Although this truck was designed and manufactured by the dawn of supersonic jets, these 30 mm cannons did provide devastating firepower against light targets where it would be hopeless against autocannons. The truck didn't see action in Czechoslovakia (and their successor states) but combat records in both South Europe and Africa still reflect its combat capability at support fire operations.
