Description of T-72M2_Moderna: 
The T-72M2 is a Slovakian upgrade of the Soviet T-72M1 main battle tank, developed in the aftermath of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992. The Slovakian tank manufacturer ZTS Dubnica, which faced a severe economic crisis and a shrinking domestic market after the split of the former federation, wanted to modernize the existing T-72M1 tanks to meet the demands of potential customers and improve the existing fleet of Slovakian armored vehicles. To achieve this, they joined forces with Belgian SABCA and French SFIM, two leading European companies in the field of systems integration. Together, they embarked on a comprehensive upgrade program, focusing on enhancing the tank’s firepower, protection, and mobility. This partnership resulted in the T-72M2 Moderna, which was equipped with an upgraded 2A46MS 125mm cannon, cutting-edge French electro-optical systems, an improved VEGA Plus fire control system, and a new modular armor package that increased the tank's protection level against kinetic and chemical threats. Other upgrades included a secondary 30mm 2A42 autocannon, a new PZL Wola S12U diesel engine, integration of Slovakian-made TAPNA APFSDS, and a new electronics package from SABCA. The T-72M2 Moderna made its debut at the IDET 1994 exhibition in Brno, Czech Republic, but failed to generate the interest of potential buyers. Later, in 1998, the Slovak Minister of Defense, Ján Sitek, signed a contract for the purchase and delivery of five T-72M2 Moderna tanks. However, only one incomplete prototype was demonstrated two years later, leaving the contract unfulfilled, and eventually the project was abandoned.
