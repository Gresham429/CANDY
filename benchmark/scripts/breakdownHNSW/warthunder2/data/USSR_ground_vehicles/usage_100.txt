Usage of T-44-100: 
The T-44-100 is a very versatile tank for its Battle Rating of 7.0. When fully upgraded, it's extremely mobile and decently fast, which allows it to go on flanks and set up ambushes to make full use of its 100 mm gun. This gun can penetrate many tanks frontally, although often you have to look for weak spots. Luckily, most of the time that you penetrate an enemy, it will destroy it in one shot, due to the explosive nature of the available shells. Having said that, it's best to make your way behind the enemy lines throughout any game, and then clean them up for your team. Moreover, you have 3 crew members in the turret, and if an APHE shell penetrates anywhere, or someone penetrates the turret side, you are most likely dead in one shot, so protect your turret.
