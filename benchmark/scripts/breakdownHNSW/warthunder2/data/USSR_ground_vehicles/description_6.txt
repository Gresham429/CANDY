Description of T-28: 
The T-28 was a Soviet medium tank developed in the early 1930s as a complement to the heavier T-35 tank, sharing turret and hull design with it. The T-28 was also influenced by the British Vickers A1E1 Independent multi-turreted tank. The T-28 featured three turrets, two armed with 7.62 mm DT machine guns and a third with a 76 mm L-10 howitzer and coaxial DT machine gun. The role of the T-28 was to provide infantry support, while the BT series tanks were to deal with enemy armour. After the experience gained during Winter and Continuation War, the T-28s were uparmoured with appliqu√© armour increasing the armour thickness from 30 to 80 mm at the front and 40 mm on the sides and rear. The T-28s took part in the defence of Leningrad and Moscow in 1941 and were quickly phased out after. A total of seven T-28s were captured by Finland during the war. Three tanks survived to this day with two in the Finnish Tank Museum in Parola and one in Moscow.
