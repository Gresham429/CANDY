History of T-80UK: 
Under the Soviet armoured doctrine, tank companies would receive a commander tank just like many major powers during the Cold War. In the Soviet case, the tank would also receive FCS upgrades aside from new communication equipment. The T-80UK was a result of such doctrine, featuring Shtora-1 soft-kill APS, Agava-2 TVD imager, atmospheric sensors, R-163U and R-163K radio, TNA-4 navigation systems, time-fuze controls and AB-1-P28 APU. The tank was likely being tested during the final days of the Soviet Union, and passed state certification during the 1990s. Likely due to insufficient funds and saving Shtora-1 APS for future tanks such as the T-72BU, the current model of the T-80UK looks extremely like an original T-80U with longer antenna for the radio.
