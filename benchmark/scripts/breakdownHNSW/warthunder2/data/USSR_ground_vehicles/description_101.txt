Description of T-54_(1947): 
The T-54 Model 1947 is the first variant of the T-54 main battle tank family. It was manufactured from 1946 to 1948, featuring a streamlined turret and wide gun mantlet, a new V-54 engine, and a 100 mm D-10T tank gun. Only a small number were built for the trials, which were a complete failure. As a result, production of the T-54 Model 1947 variant was halted until new modifications were implemented, resulting in the T-54 Model 1949 variant. The overall production journey was long and complex, with nearly 1,490 modifications made from the first variant to the last variant. It is also one of the oldest families of main battle tanks, with a long combat history that is still fielded by several nations today.
